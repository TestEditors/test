<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">siderable</span>, as there is only one story, we observe a stone surface <span style="color: #0000FF;">con </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">«<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sisting </span>of large slabs. Descending again, and looking into the halls, we may<br/>
observe the whole series borne by <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-seven </span>monolithic, columns. The<br/>
walls also are constructed of stones of similar size. At the end of this<br/>
structure, which is more than a stadium in length, is the tomb, consisting of <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>square pyramid, each side of which is four plethra (<span style="color: #ff0000;">400 </span>ft.) in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">length </span>and of equal height. The deceased, who is buried here, is called<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismandcs</span>. It is also asserted that so many <span style="color: #0000FF;">palaces </span>were built, because it<br/>
was the custom for all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">homes</span>, represented by their magnates, with<br/>
their priests and victims, to assemble here to offer <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>and gifts to the<br/>
gods, and to deliberate on the most important concerns. Each <span style="color: #0000FF;">home<br/>
</span>then took possession of the hall destined for it. Sailing about a hundred<br/>
stadia beyond this point, we next reach the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoé</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>, etc. This<br/>
description of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>by the contents of two papyri, one of<br/>
which is in the museum of Gizeh, the other in private possession <span style="color: #0000FF;">tMr</span>.<br/>

<br/>
It is very doubtful whether we should consider these buildings<br/>
of Nile bricks as remains of the ancient Labyrinth, or rather as<br/>
tombs. Certainly nothing is left that recalls in any way the splendour of the old'wonder of the world'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Except </span>some blocks of limestone, nothing remains of the extensive structures once erected<br/>
<br/>
here, save the pyramid'at the end of the labyrinth'.<br/>
<br/>
To the N. of the pyramid Mr. Flinders Petrie discovered some mummy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>with carefully painted heads (now in London). Of still greater<br/>
value are the portraits found at <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Rubaydt</span>, 13 <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medinct </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cl~Fayum</span>, which were purchased and brought to Europe <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>Theodore Graf.<br/>
<br/>
Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mums</span>. The object of Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">eris</span>, which has long since been<br/>
dried up, was to receive the superfluous water in the ease of too high<br/>
an inundation, and to distribute its contents over the fields when the<br/>
overflow was insufficient. Strabo describes Lake Moeris in the following terms<span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Owing </span>to its size and depth it is capable of receiving the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">superabundance </span>of water during the inundation, without overflowing the<br/>
habitations and crops; but later, when the water subsides, and after the<br/>
lake has given up its excess through one of its two mouths, both it and<br/>
the canal retain water enough for purposes of irrigation. This is accomplished by natural means, but at both ends of the canal there are <span style="color: #0000FF;">also<br/>
</span>lock-gates, by means of which the engineers can regulate the influx<br/>
and efflux of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">water</span>.' The lock-gate, which in ancient times admitted the water conducted from the Nile by the canal into the lake,<br/>
was probably situated near the modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">eerahmt </span>(see below), the name of<br/>
which is supposed to be derived from the old <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptian'Ro-hun</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'Lerum</span>", tie.'the mouth of the lake<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, and the site of which was probably<br/>
once occupied by the town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemais</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">There </span>is a difference of opinion as to the Situation and Form of the<br/>
Ancient Lake. Linant-Bey, arguing from the considerable <span style="color: #ff0000;">dilTerenee </span>of<br/>
level between the two lakes, maintains that the Birket <span style="color: #ff0000;">e1lur0n </span>(Lake<br/>
of the Horns, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">465 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>could never have formed part of Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">eris</span>, as was<br/>
formerly supposed, and he assigns to the latter a much smaller area than<br/>
was attributed to it under the earlier theory. Placing it farther to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sol</span>, nearer to the Labyrinth and <span style="color: #0000FF;">el- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Latin</span>, he makes its boundary-line<br/>
