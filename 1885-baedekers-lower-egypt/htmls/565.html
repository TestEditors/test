and we are told, <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>when he raised his hands, Israel had the mastery,<br/>
and when he let them fall<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Amalek had the mastery<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">And </span>Joshua <span style="color: #0000FF;">discomfited </span>Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>It is<br/>
natural that a battle should have been fought on the outskirts of the<br/>
oasis, as the Amalekite <span style="color: #0000FF;">possessor-s </span>of this fertile island in the midst of<br/>
the desert would he very unlikely to yield up their valuable property<br/>
without a blow. We are then informed (Exodus xviii.), that Moses,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">where </span>he <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamped </span>at the mount of God', organised the people by the<br/>
advice of Jethro, his <span style="color: #0000FF;">father-in-law</span>, who came to visit him, and chose<br/>
valiant men from all Israel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span>he set over them'to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>rulers of<br/>
thousands, and rulers of hundreds, rulers of fifties, and rulers of tens'.<br/>
'And (Numb. xxxiii. 15) they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in<br/>
the wilderness of Sinai<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Exodus xix. 2)'they were departed from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rephidim</span>, and were come to the desert of Sinai, and had pitched in the<br/>
wilderness; and there Israel camped before the mount. And Moses went<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span>unto God'. (Comp. R. Lepsius,'Reise nach der <span style="color: #0000FF;">Halbinsel </span>des Sinai',<br/>

<br/>
</span>The most conspicuous of the hills visible hence is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebet<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ey- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Flit</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sneh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mill</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mountain</span>), situated in a line with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">menastery </span>hill (to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, rising above the bed of the valley to the<br/>
height of 700 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>, and crowned with the ruin of a handsome church.<br/>
The steep, neglected path ascending to it is flanked with the remains of ancient chapels; and near it are many houses built of<br/>
loose stones. The windows of these look towards the outside, and<br/>
not into the court according to Oriental usage. The settlement is<br/>
enlivened with children, poultry, and dogs, and with its babbling<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">break </span>almost resembles a Tyrolese mountain village. Farther N.<br/>
rises the summit of the lofty Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">el</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bem'it </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">4017 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>), or the<br/>
'Mountain of the Virgins', sometimes called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bint</span>, or<br/>
'Mountain of the Virgin'. It is probably so called from a chapel of<br/>
the Virgin situated here, but the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>maintain that it derives<br/>
its name from two <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tawara </span>maidens, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>had been ordered to marry<br/>
against their wishes, and who therefore fled to the mountains.<br/>
They were <span style="color: #ff0000;">overtaken </span>by their pursuers on the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Benit</span>, but,<br/>
rather than be captured, they plaited their tresses together and<br/>
precipitated themselves from the rocky summit into the abyss. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the N. side of the valley are numerous tombs of hermits and monks<br/>
who spent their lives on Mt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serbal </span>and in the monastery of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bishopric </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0f </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharan</span>. These tombs are mentioned by Makrizi so<br/>
early as <span style="color: #0000FF;">1440</span>. Prof. Palmer re-discovered <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and observed that<br/>
the bodies had been buried in a line from E. to W., in coarse<br/>
shrouds and <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>of which traces remained.<br/>
<br/>
Mount <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serbal </span>(6712 ft.; Le. Serb Ba'al, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'palm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rove </span>of Baal')<br/>
rises to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">B. </span>in the form of a broad, serrated pyramid.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>ASCENT <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>MOUNT <span style="color: #0000FF;">SERBAL </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>and fatiguing, and should<br/>
be attempted by experienced mountaineers only, especially as the guides<br/>
afford little assistance (the best of them is Husan <span style="color: #0000FF;">el- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Harbi</span>). The expedition takes a whole day <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the ascent 5 <span style="color: #0000FF;">hi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, so that the start should be<br/>
made before sunrise. Strong boots are essential, the rocks being hard<br/>
and sharp.<br/>
<br/>
The ascent is most conveniently made through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W511i'Aleydt </span>on<br/>
the N. side, but it may also be made through the Wadi <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seldf </span>(p. 501)<br/>
