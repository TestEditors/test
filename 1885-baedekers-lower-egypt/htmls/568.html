<span>500 Route 10. <span style="color: #ff0000;">SERBKL</span>. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues<br/>
<br/>
</span>imposing peaks of the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mi'isa </span>group. If it be asked how the<br/>
glorious title of the'Mount of the Lord<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>came to be transferred from one<br/>
mountain to another, the question may be answered without much<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty</span>. When the early Christians settled in the peninsula, they<br/>
fond no memorials of the Exodus, but arbitrarily assigned Old Testament<br/>
names to the various hills and valleys, a practice which, as we shall afterwards see, was imitated to excess by the monks of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">monastery </span>of<br/>
St. Catharine on the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Niisa</span>. One group of anchorites identified<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lilt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Serbal</span>, and another the imposing mountain situated farther <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the<br/>
S., with'Mount Horeb'. As long as <span style="color: #0000FF;">I'haran </span>was a powerful place and<br/>
an <span style="color: #0000FF;">episcopal </span>see, its right to claim the title was generally recognised, but<br/>
after it had lapsed into heresy, this right was denied by the orthodox<br/>
church, and the hermits of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jehel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mfisa </span>group were expressly <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognised </span>as the genuine <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sinuitcs</span>, for whose protection Justinian caused<br/>
a castle to be built. The anchorites and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ccenobitcs </span>of Mt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Scrbfil</span>, who<br/>
were decimated by the frequently recurring attacks of the Saracens,<br/>
accordingly emigrated to the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">N1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1sa </span>for safety. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>have already<br/>
cited a remarkable passage of early date, in which it is expressly stated,<br/>
that the monks of Sinai had emigrated from another mountain, and had<br/>
settled on the modern Sinai by God's command. See the writings of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius </span>already mentioned (p. 497), where these views were expressed for the<br/>
first time, and are fully discussed. Many critics have since adopted the<br/>
same theory.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moharrct </span>hill (see p. 495), we proceed towards the<br/>
NE. under palm-trees. The ground becomes soft, and is carpeted<br/>
with turf, moss, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">seeds</span>, interspersed with blue and red flowers.<br/>
We pass rich fields of <span style="color: #0000FF;">wheat</span>, besides tobacco and other industrial<br/>
crops; the bushes are enlivened by birds, and flocks of sheep and<br/>
goats lie by the side of the brooks under the shade of the trees.<br/>
After <span style="color: #ff0000;">1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hr</span>. the palm-trees leave off, and are succeeded by a thicket<br/>
of tarfa shrubs, which we <span style="color: #ff0000;">traverseiu </span>1/4 hour. Many <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthese </span>shrubs<br/>
assume the form of trees, <span style="color: #0000FF;">2h-3 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in circumference.<br/>
<br/>
It is only in the lower part of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esh-Sh√©kh </span>(p. 520), and here in<br/>
its prolongation, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Witch </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Firz'tn</span>, so far as the latter is watered by the<br/>
brook, that these <span style="color: #0000FF;">term </span>plants yield the well-known Manna. Minute holes<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand </span>in the fine bark of the thin, brown twigs, by an insect (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Coccns<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">manniparus</span>) which was first observed by Ehrenberg, and from the almost<br/>
invisible openings issues a transparent drop <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">juice</span>, which then falls <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>and burdens in the sand<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This sweet gum, resembling honey, which is<br/>
still called'man' by the Arabians, is collected and preserved in considerable quantities; the monks in the monastery generally keep a supply,<br/>
partly for their own use, and partly for sale, in tin boxes. In 1845 Lepsius<br/>
found the whole valley fragrant with manna as early as the end of March,<br/>
but it is usually most plentiful from the end of April to the end of<br/>
June, and the more so in proportion to the moisture of the preceding<br/>
winter.<br/>
<br/>
Adjoining the rocky slopes on the left rise numerous <span style="color: #ff0000;">tentshapcd </span>mounds of earth, upwards of 100 ft. in height, which Fraas<br/>
takes to he the remains of ancient moraines. After 1/2 hr. the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Wtdi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Akhyar </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">521 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, leading towards the E., diverges to the<br/>
left. Opposite to it <span style="color: #ff0000;">Opens </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wtdi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rattamch</span>, to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>of which<br/>
rises a hill situated to the S. (right) of the road, called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jcbel<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cl-lilunaja</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.'Mountain of the conversation <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>God and<br/>
Moses'. The Arabs still offer <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices </span>here to Moses within a circle<br/>
of stones on the summit of the hill, <span style="color: #0000FF;">singing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'O </span>mountain of the<br/>
conversation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moises</span>, we seek thy favour; preserve thy good people<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
