<br/>
</span>of the work, and fragments of monuments with inscriptions both in<br/>
the Persian and Egyptian character, have been found <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>432).<br/>
Under the Ptolemies the canal system was extended. While one<br/>
arm led from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phakusa </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">file </span>to the lakes towards the S. of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pelnsium</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>that is, direct to the Mediterranean through the connected<br/>
lakes of Balah and Menzaleh, another branch was now constructed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balah </span>to the Bitter Lakes, into which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fresh-water<br/>
</span>canal watering the scriptural land of Goshen also fell (p. 409). It<br/>
was thus feasible in the time of the Ptolemies to travel by water<br/>
from the Nile to the S. part and also to the N. part ofa canal,<br/>
which, like the modern Suez Canal, connected the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea and the<br/>
Mediterranean in a nearly direct line. When Antony returned to<br/>
Egypt after the battle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Actium </span>in B. <span style="color: #ff0000;">C. </span>31, Cleopatra made an<br/>
unsuccessful attempt to convey her ships across the Isthmus of Suez<br/>
in order to escape with her treasures from Octavian. As, however,<br/>
it is very improbable that she would have attempted to transport<br/>
vessels of considerable size for so long a distance by land, there<br/>
can be little doubt that the canal still existed in her time, although<br/>
in a dilapidated and unserviceable condition.<br/>
<br/>
The canal is said to have been restored during the Roman<br/>
period. Another canal, beginning near Cairo, and terminating in the<br/>
Gulf of Suez, the precise course of which, probably following the<br/>
earlier channel, is nowhere described, is said to have been called<br/>
the Amnis Trajanus, and was probably constructed during the<br/>
reign of that emperor (<span style="color: #0000FF;">NO</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">98-117</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. A canal of Hadrian is also<br/>
mentioned. It is certain, however, that the chief mercantile route<br/>
between the lied Sea and Italy <span style="color: #0000FF;">did </span>not follow the Nile and the canal thence to the Gulf of Suez. The Indian vessels of the Romans<br/>
touched at <span style="color: #ff0000;">llerenike</span>, a little to the N. of the tropic of Cancer, and<br/>
still more frequently at Leukos <span style="color: #ff0000;">Linlen</span>, the modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kogt'l</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, or at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Myos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hermes </span>in the latitude of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sift</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>(Lykopolis) on the Red Sea.<br/>
From these two last-named seaports, which were much frequented,<br/>
especially in the month of September, goods were conveyed by the<br/>
great <span style="color: #0000FF;">caravan-route </span>to Koptos on the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>near the <span style="color: #0000FF;">modem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh</span>),<br/>
and were then transferred to boats which carried them down the<br/>
Nile to Alexandria, where they were shipped for their ultimate<br/>
destination. After the Arabs had conquered Egypt, they must have<br/>
been desirous of connecting the Lower Egyptian part of the Nile<br/>
as directly as possible with the Red Sea<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAmr </span>ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'As.si </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">101 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]<br/>
</span>accordingly restored the ancient canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cor </span>which the Khalig at Cairo<br/>
is said to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>a portion), and used it for the transport of grain from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostiit </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">5241</span>) to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kolzum </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">LSnez</span>), whence it was exported by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea to Arabia. The bed <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the ancient canal is said to have<br/>
been pointed out to'Amr by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copt</span>, to whom a remission of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">poll-tux </span>was granted as a reward. The canal is said to have been<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>up by the morbidly suspicious Khalif <span style="color: #0000FF;">Al-Maru</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ihn </span>Mohammed (754-775), in order to <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>off the supplies of the army <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
