<br/>
predecessors on account of the Semitic religious rites practised there.<br/>
Tanis is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">min </span>of the Bible, where Moses performed his miracles in the<br/>
presence of Pharaoh. This place was doubtless often visited by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>,<br/>
who was a powerful conqueror and founder of cities, not only when on his<br/>
way to battle, and on his return as a victor, but because his presence must<br/>
often have been necessary for the prevention of rebellion among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>foreigners resident in these E. districts. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">lsraelitish </span>records only<br/>
mention the oppression they underwent towards the end of their sojourn in<br/>
Egypt. Ramses, however, was far from being a capricious tyrant, but was<br/>
a wise, though severe military <span style="color: #0000FF;">prince </span>who employed the Semitic settlers<br/>
in his kingdom in the construction of useful works, in order to prevent<br/>
them from endangering his empire. The Jews, perhaps, also assisted in<br/>
strengthening the double series of bastions, known as the wall of Sesostris,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>constructed before the time of Ramses, which closed the Isthmus <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sites </span>and afterwards obstructed the progress of the emigrants. The'Egyptian wall' with its forts and frontier fortresses also afforded protection<br/>
against the Asiatics, and commanded the district of Goshen.<br/>
<br/>
The Pharaoh of the Exodus. Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>was succeeded by his thirteenth son Merenptah (p. 90), a man of mature age. At the beginning of<br/>
his reign <span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenptah </span>came into serious collision with the Libyans, who<br/>
had allied themselves with the warlike inhabitants of the Mediterranean<br/>
islands, and had attacked the coast of Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>succeeded, however,<br/>
in subduing them, and was thus enabled to march <span style="color: #0000FF;">Victoriously </span>to Thebes,<br/>
where he caused spacious buildings to be erected, and encouraged the<br/>
scientific labours of the priests. Like his father, he also occasionally resided<br/>
at Tanis, as the monuments inform us, and seems to have accorded greater<br/>
liberty to the Semitic inhabitants of the Delta than his predecessor.<br/>
Being, however, less powerful and resolute, he was more exposed to danger<br/>
from his Asiatic neighbours than Ramses, who had not only rendered<br/>
them tributary, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>leagued himself with them by intermarriages and<br/>
treaties of peace, of which valuable records are still preserved. Moreover, before his accession to the throne the fortification of the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">frontier </span>of the empire had been completed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>continued, nevertheless, to<br/>
employ the bondsmen in Goshen<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and to keep them in check, as they<br/>
might have become very formidable if they had succeeded in uniting their<br/>
forces against Egypt. Accordingly, when Moses requested Pharaoh to allow<br/>
him to lead his people into the desert, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lllerenptah</span>'s policy was to refuse,<br/>
his great object being to prevent the union of the Israelites with other<br/>
<br/>
Now the monuments mention a <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hetam </span>called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Klzetam </span>in the Province of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">207</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>(i.e. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanis-Ramses</span>, p. 452), to distinguish it from other fortresses of<br/>
the same name. A representation of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iihetam </span>is preserved on a <span style="color: #0000FF;">monument </span>of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>in Karnak, in the form of a fortress on both banks of<br/>
the river <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the Pelusiac arm of the Nile), the <span style="color: #0000FF;">opposite </span>parts being connected by a bridge (Kantara), <span style="color: #ff0000;">wwhile </span>a town, named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tabenet</span>, lies in the<br/>
vicinity. [ This <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tabenet </span>is probably to be identified with the'Pelusian<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dapltmze </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tthe </span>plural form being applied to the double fortress), of which<br/>
Herodotus <span style="color: #0000FF;">tii</span>. 30) expressly says, that it was occupied in his time, and<br/>
before <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>by an Egyptian garrison for the protection of the frontier <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards </span>Arabia and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Swim </span>] <span style="color: #ff0000;">lletam </span>together with the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tabenet</span>, is probably to be sought for in the ruins of Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dcfemtch </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span>see<br/>
Map of the Canal of Suez, p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>). The memory of the<br/>
bridge <span style="color: #0000FF;">theaters</span>) connecting <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>double fortress still survives in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fungal-a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>see p. 435), which lies a little to the E. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tell </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Defenneh</span>.<br/>
The accuracy of this theory, according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch</span>, is also proved by the<br/>
Egyptian and classical accounts of the roads which led to the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tania-Sin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>. Two such roads are said to have existed<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>one<br/>
of these led to the N.E. by Pithom (p. 412) through the marshy district<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Succoth</span>, with its numerous canals, and, according to the Egyptian<br/>
texts and the authority of Pliny, was unsuitable for caravans and therefore <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>little frequented; the second was used by the Pharaohs when<br/>
they marched towards the E. with their chariots and <span style="color: #0000FF;">horsemen</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and led<br/>
from Ramses to Segol in Succoth, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khetam</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">migdol</span>. In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">British<br/>
