<br/>
A few paces from the station of the direct or English line to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramleh</span>, and close to the sea, rises the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Roman Tower (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>), which,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, seems to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabian </span>origin. It was adjoined, down to March<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1850</span>, by the famous obelisk called Cleopatra's Needle<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>which vied with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pompey</span>'s Column in general interest as a monument of <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity </span>One<br/>
of the last acts of the Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'il </span>was to present this obelisk to the<br/>
city of New York. Both the native and foreign residents of Alexandria<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">look </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span>with indignation while this interesting relic was raised by<br/>
American machinery from the place it had occupied for 2000 years and<br/>
removed to the specially constructed vessel that was to convey it to New<br/>
York. Indeed it was only the public sympathy with the young Khedive<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lik</span>, who looked upon the presentation as a legacy of his father's<br/>
government. that prevented a popular outbreak over this piece of vandalism<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>obelisk now <span style="color: #0000FF;">form </span>one of the prominent features of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Central </span>Park in New York, where, however, it is feared that it will rapidly<br/>
become defaced by the severity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">climate</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- A companion obelisk,<br/>
that lay for centuries prone in the sand by the side of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cleopatra</span>'s Needle,<br/>
now adorns the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Th'ames </span>Embankment at London.<br/>
<br/>
The direct local railway traverses the rubbish heaps of the<br/>
ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nicopolis</span>. Projecting into the sea, to the left, is the small<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">FortSilseleh</span>. We here obtain a retrospective glimpse of the sickle<br/>
shaped <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. side of the town.<br/>
<br/>
Nicopolis<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>situated beyond the Hippodrome (of which no trace is<br/>
now left), about 30 stadia to the E. of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">city </span>is said to have been'no<br/>
smaller than a town', and received its <span style="color: #0000FF;">name'town </span>of victory'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>from<br/>
Octavian (Augustus) in memory of the victory he gained here over<br/>
Antony and his adherents. A small Temple, recently discovered close to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">seat </span>and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>of the ruins of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kay </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Nii.seveh </span>(castle of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wear</span>), the ruined walls of which have been pulled down to <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford<br/>
</span>material for the new palace of the Khedive (see below), was perhaps<br/>
also erected by Octavian on the same occasion.<br/>
<br/>
To the right, skirting the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mabrmldfyeh </span>Canal, runs the Rosetta<br/>
railway (p. 447). Near the station of (4 M.) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sidi </span>Gaber, on a slight<br/>
eminence to the left, and not far from the site of the old Roman<br/>
castle above mentioned, is a new <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroyal </span>palace, called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mustafa<br/>
</span>Pasha. The Catacombs situated to the NE. of this point are almost<br/>
entirely destroyed. The train now passes a series of villas and<br/>
gardens full of <span style="color: #0000FF;">luxuriant </span>vegetation, the most attractive of which<br/>
lie beyond the fourth of the five stations.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Shu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramleh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.'sand') is a modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span>, consisting <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>of numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">country-houses </span>(Pensions Beaus√©jour and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramare</span>,<br/>
both good), some of which are occupied by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrian </span>families<br/>
throughout the whole year. It possesses waterworks of its own, which<br/>
greatly facilitate horticulture. On the way to the sea the traveller<br/>
will observe a few relics of the Greek and Roman periods.<br/>
