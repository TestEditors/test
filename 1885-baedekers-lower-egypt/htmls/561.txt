<span>to Sinai. <span style="color: #0000FF;">WAD </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">FIRM</span>. 10. Route. <span style="color: #ff0000;">495<br/>
<br/>
</span>next valleys on the right are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ed-Dér</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Neuron</span>, Et- <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tan</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abfi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gcrréydt</span>; and opposite the latter opens the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wddi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fofr</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>valley of greater extent. A little before reaching the oasis, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">pass<br/>
</span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock </span>called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llégi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Khutmtin</span>, which is entirely covered with<br/>
small stones. Prof. Palmer was the first traveller who was told<br/>
by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>that this <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock </span>was the one which yielded water<br/>
when struck by Moses.<br/>
<br/>
The plants of the desert now occur more frequently, and are of<br/>
more vigorous growth; bushes of tamarisk, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nebk</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">seyil</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees</span>, make their appearance, and the scene is enlivened by<br/>
the notes of birds of grey and dark plumage. We now quit the<br/>
desert, and with feelings of unmitigated delight, after a hot journey of more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">She</span>. in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Firan</span>, we enter the Oasis of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Firan</span>, the'Pearl of Sinai<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, and by far the most fertile tract in the<br/>
whole peninsula. We first <span style="color: #0000FF;">reach </span>the dale of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Hesweh</span>, a few<br/>
hundred paces only in length, watered by an inexhaustible brook<br/>
which is suddenly swallowed up by the earth here, after having<br/>
converted the whole of the valley above this point into a luxuriant<br/>
garden in the midst of the desert. The gardens are watered by<br/>
means of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shadfifs </span>or buckets; the dates grown here are celebrated.<br/>
Every tree has its proprietor, who obtains the whole of its produce,<br/>
even when he lives at a distance, his property being protected by<br/>
the honest <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>of the oasis and the inmates of the monastery.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">road-side</span>, and on the left slope of the valley, are Beduin<br/>
huts, gardens, and the ruins of stone houses, dating from the time<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>Firan. In 1/4 hr. more we reach a second small<br/>
group of palms, and for a few minutes we obtain a <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W.<br/>
</span>side of Mount <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serbal</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>min. more we reach a wider part of the<br/>
valley, in which the rocky and isolated hill of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Jllelwrret </span>rises to<br/>
a height of about 100 ft., bearing on its summit the traces of an<br/>
early Christian monastery and church. Exactly opposite the ruin<br/>
of the monastery the traveller should <span style="color: #0000FF;">notice </span>a very curious <span style="color: #0000FF;">geological </span>formation, consisting of a vein of green diorite in <span style="color: #0000FF;">flesh-coloured </span>porphyry, which is in its turn <span style="color: #ff0000;">imbeddedin </span>green <span style="color: #0000FF;">mica</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">slate</span>.<br/>
The largest fragment of the ruins, called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Irererat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Netrtr</span>, stands<br/>
on the summit of the hill which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>regard as the spot<br/>
where Moses prayed during the battle with the Amalekites <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Exodus, xvii. 10), and at its base the relics of a large church are still<br/>
traceable. Fragments of columns and ornaments, which once <span style="color: #0000FF;">belonged </span>to it, are to be found built into the walls of the houses.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wfidis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ejeleh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and'Aleydt</span>, valleys diverging here, are watered<br/>
in winter by streams from the mountains which are sometimes<br/>
covered with snow. This picturesque spot is a favourite <span style="color: #ff0000;">haltingplace </span>with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bednins </span>owing to the facilities for watering the<br/>
camels. The best <span style="color: #0000FF;">camping-ground </span>is alittle to the E. of the entrance to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wzidi'Aleyat</span>, and in such a position as to command<br/>
a view of the pinnacled summit of Mt. Serbal (p. 497)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
