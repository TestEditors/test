<br/>
of the villages of Syria the traveller will observe small <span style="color: #ff0000;">deme00vered </span>buildings, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>grated <span style="color: #ff0000;">Windows</span>, and surmounted by the<br/>
crescent. These are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ll'clt</span>'s, <span style="color: #ff0000;">mausoloa </span>of saints, or<br/>
tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékhs</span>. In the interior there is usually a block of stone,<br/>
hewn in the shape of a sarcophagus and covered with a green or<br/>
red <span style="color: #0000FF;">cloth</span>, on which texts from the Koran are embroidered in gold<br/>
or silver. The walls are generally embellished with paintings<br/>
representing the sacred cities of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-lslam</span>, and executed in an<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">amusingly </span>primitive style. Suspended from the ceiling by cords<br/>
and threads are little boats, ostrich eggs, and numerous paper<br/>
bags filled with sacred earth from Mecca. In one corner are<br/>
a thick <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>candle and a heap of bones of all kinds. The tomb is<br/>
usually surrounded by a burial-ground, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>certain persons have<br/>
the privilege of being interred<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Schools are also frequently connected with these <span style="color: #0000FF;">weli</span>'s. Shreds of cloth are often seen suspended from<br/>
the railings of these tombs, or on certain trees which are considered sacred, having been placed there by devout persons. This<br/>
curious custom is of ancient origin.<br/>
<br/>
About the end of the 18th century a reaction against the abuses<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islim </span>sprang <span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Central Arabia. The WAHHABITES, or<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wahhabees</span>, named after their founder'Abd <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Wahhab</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to restore the religion to its original purity; they destroyed<br/>
all tombs of saints, including even those <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Mohammed and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hfisén</span>,<br/>
as objects of superstitious reverence, and sought to restore the<br/>
primitive simplicity <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>prophet's code of morals; and they even<br/>
forbade the smoking of tobacco as being <span style="color: #0000FF;">intoxicating </span>They soon<br/>
became a great political power, and had not Mohammad <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ali </span>deemed<br/>
it his interest to suppress them, their <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>would have been<br/>
far more <span style="color: #0000FF;">widely </span>extended than it now <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>As to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Senusi<br/>

We have hitherto spoken of the doctrines of the Sunnites (from<br/>
summ,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'tradition</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, who form one great <span style="color: #0000FF;">sect </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islim</span>. At an early<br/>
period the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SHi'ITES </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">sWa</span>,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'sect'j </span>seceded from the Sunnites.<br/>
They assigned <span style="color: #ff0000;">to'Ali</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">son-in-law </span>of Mohammed, a rank equal<br/>
or even superior to that of the prophet himself; they regarded him<br/>
as an incarnation of the Deity, and believed in the divine mission<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imams </span>descended from him. El-Mahdi, the last of these,<br/>
is believed by them not to have died, but to be awaiting in<br/>
concealment the coming of the last day. The Persians are all<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Sht'ites</span>. Towards the West also <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shi'itism </span>was widely disseminated<br/>
at an early period, particularly in Egypt under the regime of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>sovereigns. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shi'ites </span>are extremely fanatical, refusing even to eat in the society of persons of a different <span style="color: #0000FF;">creed</span>.<br/>
The other sects, which are <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">confined </span>to Syria <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mctdwiteh</span>,<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ismdtttyels</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nosairiyeh</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Druses</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>), are noticed in<br/>
