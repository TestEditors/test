cessors, it was not unnatural that he should have showed special <span style="color: #0000FF;">veneration </span>for the Sphinx-Harmachis, and chosen him for his tutelary god.<br/>
Every Pharaoh was, as we are aware, regarded as an earthly incarnation<br/>
of Ra<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and also, as many monuments testify, of Ra Harmachis. The kings<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>therefore<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>afterwards chose the Sphinx to symbolise the divine nature of<br/>
their mission as monarchs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and it was a favourite practice to crown the lion's<br/>
body with a head <span style="color: #ff0000;">bearing </span>their own features. The Sphinx representing<br/>
a king is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">neb</span>, or'lord'. The Assyrians provided their sphinxes with<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wings </span>as symbols of speed and of the power of rising above earthly things.<br/>
<br/>
About 3/4 hr. in a due S. direction from the Sphinx, on the outskirts<br/>
of the desert, is a spot known to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bednins </span>where numerous fossils<br/>
occur in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">meiocene </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sand-formation</span>. Among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">commonest </span>are the<br/>
curious <span style="color: #ff0000;">sea-urehinstClypeaster</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bednins </span>frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>for sale.<br/>
- In the desert<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>about <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hnk </span>farther distant<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>petrified wood is said to<br/>
occur (comp. p. 339).<br/>
<br/>
A few paces to the SE. of the Sphinx is situated the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Granite<br/>
</span>Temple, a large building constructed of granite and alabaster, discovered by M. Mariette in 1853. The different chambers are now<br/>
kept free of sand, so that they can be examined in every part. The<br/>
object of the building has not yet been ascertained, but there can<br/>
be no doubt that it was in <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>way connected with the Sphinx.<br/>
The inscription of <span style="color: #0000FF;">KhuN </span>mentioned at p. 364 speaks of a Temple<br/>
of the Sphinx. The statues of Chephren (pp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">300</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">307 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>found here<br/>
seem to indicate that he was the founder of this structure; and, <span style="color: #ff0000;">if<br/>
</span>so, this would be the only temple handed down to us from the prim<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">2cva1 </span>monarchy. At the same time the building so closely resembles<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>(p. 379), that, particularly as it stands in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis<br/>
</span>of Memphis, it was perhaps rather one of those monuments which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>dedicated to the rites of the dead; and it seems <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>improbable that Chephren, who built the Second Pyramid as his tomb,<br/>
erected this edifice as a place of assembly for the worshippers,<br/>
of his manes. The building is a fine example of the simple<br/>
and majestic architecture of that remote period, when the art of<br/>
working the hardest kinds of stone had already attained perfection.<br/>
The chisel which in the hand of the stone-mason shaped these<br/>
blocks of granite with such exquisite skill, could doubtless, when<br/>
wielded by the sculptor, easily create a statue of Chephren.<br/>

protected by walls against the encroachment of the sand, we pass<br/>

Entrance (d) to a flight of steps, which turns at a right angle and<br/>
ascends to a small chamber, where an opening on the S. side leads<br/>
to the granite roof of the temple. This passage and chamber are<br/>
also constructed of alabaster. At the E. end of the corridor we enter<br/>
