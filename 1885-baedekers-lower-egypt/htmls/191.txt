</span>the portal <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Prosekos</span>, or hall'of the manifestation of majesty',<br/>
they were permitted to behold from afar the sacred emblem <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>divinity. These worshippers were now passed by the king and the<br/>
officiating priests, who ascended in solemn procession to the roof,<br/>
while the high priest entered the small and sombre chamber of the<br/>
god. The annexed <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-plan </span>of the S. temple at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak </span>will<br/>

analogous arrangements might easily be pointed out in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temples</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>other nations, such as those of Semitic race<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The erection of<br/>
obelisks or <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossi </span>(or <span style="color: #0000FF;">both</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>in front of the pylons is also <span style="color: #0000FF;">susceptible </span>of easy explanation. The obelisks, the form of which was well<br/>
adapted to break the monotonous outline of the walls, record <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>

hieroglyphic inscriptions the victorious power bestowed on the<br/>
Pharaohs by the god, while the royal statues remind <span style="color: #0000FF;">beholders </span>of<br/>
the duty of monarchs to show their gratitude by erecting temples <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the gods. The winged disk of the sun with the heads of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Umus<br/>
</span>serpent over every entrance has also a noteworthy <span style="color: #0000FF;">signification</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>1t<br/>
symbolises the victory of Horus over <span style="color: #0000FF;">Typhon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, and the triumph of<br/>
good over evil; and an inscription at Edfu informs us that, after<br/>
the victory of Horus, Thoth <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reason</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>commanded this symbol to be<br/>
placed over all entrances. On the other hand the way in which<br/>
architecture is constantly made subservient to <span style="color: #0000FF;">painting</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>for the<br/>
purpose of obtaining surfaces for symbols and inscriptions, is<br/>
unpleasing. Every column<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>every pillar, every roof-beam, and every<br/>
wall is embellished with raised or engraved figures and characters<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>all of which are painted. The scenes which portray the victories of<br/>
the Pharaohs, and their intercourse with the gods, are always accompanied by explanatory inscriptions, and even the simplest ornaments used under the new empire have some <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolical </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">signification</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The form of temple above described sometimes required to be<br/>
varied in consequence of the nature of the site. In Lower Nubia<br/>
the sandstone rocks approach so near the Nile that the temples had<br/>
to be partially or wholly excavated in their sides. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Girgeh</span>, for<br/>
example (Fig. <span style="color: #0000FF;">NO</span>, the pylons and the colonnaded courtyard were<br/>
built in the open air in front ofthe temple, while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hypostyle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
