<span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>ascended to the stupendous monument, and also found <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>the paws of the lion a carefully laid pavement, at the end of<br/>
which next to the breast of the Sphinx rose a kind of open temple,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">dyided </span>by two partitions, through<br/>
which ran a passage, containing a<br/>
small figure of a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">recumbent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lion</span>, facing the Sphinx, in<br/>
the middle. In the<br/>
background rose a<br/>
pillar, and at the<br/>
sides were two<br/>
others, forming a<br/>
kind of wall. The<br/>
one next the breast<br/>
of the Sphinx was<br/>
particularly interesting from the fact<br/>
that it <span style="color: #0000FF;">bore </span>the date<br/>
of the reign <span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
</span>Thothmes Ill. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">18th </span>Dynasty.<br/>
Several of these<br/>
relics are now preserved in the British Museum. The<br/>
Sphinx was also<br/>
entirely excavated by M. Mariette.<br/>
<br/>
History of the Sphinx. It was pointed <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lupsius </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">18-13<br/>
</span>that the Sphinx must have been founded earlier than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">15th<br/>
</span>Dynasty, notwithstanding the above mentioned inscription on one<br/>
of the tablets. The date there given is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>year of the reign of<br/>
Thothmes <span style="color: #ff0000;">111.</span>, which contains the account of the dream of that<br/>
monarch while practising at a target and hunting near the Sphinx.<br/>
From the inscription at the end the Sphinx appears to have<br/>
been a representation of Khafra or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghephren7 </span>whose <span style="color: #ff0000;">eartonche<br/>

<br/>
</span>consecutive lines of the inscription, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">O </span>alone having been <span style="color: #0000FF;">obliterated</span>. In his dream Thothmes is asked by the Sphinx to clear<br/>
away the encroachments of sand. As the Sphinx lies nearly in a<br/>
line <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the Pyramid of that king, it was not unnaturally thought<br/>
that he was the founder of both monuments. This conjecture<br/>
seemed to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">confirmed </span>by the discovery of the statue of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ohephren<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
