the Greek, and more particularly the Egyptian, forms of worship. The<br/>
place where the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hull </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">was </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">chietly </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">worshipped </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">down </span>to a very late<br/>
period is ascertained to have <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>Memphis (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">372</span>). The Temple of<br/>
Scrapis, when completed, is said to have been surpassed in grandeur by<br/>
no other building in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'world </span>except the Roman Capitol. It lay to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span>of Alexandria, in the suburb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ithakotis</span>, and not far from the<br/>
Necropolis, on an eminence ascended on one side by a carriage-road and<br/>
and on the other by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of steps, widening towards the top and leading<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>platform with a vaulted <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof </span>borne by four columns. Beyond this<br/>
were <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span>containing chambers set apart for the worship of the<br/>
god, and a number <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lofty </span>saloons which at the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Philadelphus </span>contained a library <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">42,000 </span>vols. This collection was afterwards much <span style="color: #0000FF;">enlarged</span>, and is said to have comprised 300,000 vols. at a later period. There were<br/>
also numerous subterranean chambers, used for various purposes, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>number of dependencies, as at the Serapeum of Memphis (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>383). The<br/>
interior of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">colounades </span>was enriched with extraordinary magnificence.<br/>
The walls were richly painted, and the ceilings and capitals of the columns gilded. Within the sanctuary stood the statue of the god, which<br/>
probably consisted of a wooden figure overlaid with various precious metals.<br/>
An opening ingeniously introduced in the sanctuary admitted rays of light<br/>
falling on the mouth <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the idol,'as <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>kissing him'. Most of the extant<br/>
images of Serapis are of dark stone. <span style="color: #0000FF;">That </span>of Alexandria, which is sometimes said to have consisted of emerald, was probably coloured dark blue.<br/>
On its head was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">calathos</span>, and at its feet lay Cerberus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the heads<br/>
of a wolf, a lion, and a dog, around which was entwined a serpent.<br/>
After Alexander's death, when his empire was divided among<br/>
his generals, Ptolemy, the son <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofLagus </span>(p. 96), came into possession<br/>
of Egypt, and Alexandria became his capital. The population of<br/>
the city increased greatly, and it attracted a large number of Jewish<br/>
settlers, to whom Ptolemy assigned a suburb on the coast, towards<br/>
the E. During his wise and upright reign Alexandria became a great<br/>
resort of artists and scholars, including Demetrius Phalereus, the<br/>
orator (p. 211), Apelles and Antiphilus, the painters, Euclid, the<br/>
mathematician, and Erasistratus and Herophilus, the physicians,<br/>
in whose society the king spent much of his time. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">history </span>of<br/>
Alexander the Great written by Ptolemy himself has unfortunately<br/>
been <span style="color: #0000FF;">lost </span>Under his successor, Ptolemy H. Philadelphus (p. 96),<br/>
the Museum <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">210 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>attained its highest prosperity. Among its<br/>
distinguished members were Sosibius and Zoilus, the grammarians;<br/>
Strato, the natural philosopher; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Timochares </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aristarchus</span>, the<br/>
astronomers; Apollodorus, the physician; Hegesias, the philosopher;<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Zonodotus</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theocritus</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gallimachus</span>, and Philetas, the poets; and<br/>
the versatile Timon. <span style="color: #ff0000;">it </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">was </span>about this period that the Old Testament<br/>
was translated from Hebrew into Greek, the new version being<br/>
called the Septuagint from the tradition that seventy translators<br/>
were engaged in the work. Under Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">lII</span>. Euergetes (p. 96),<br/>
Aristophanes of Byzantium, the grammarian and critic, became the<br/>
director of the Museum, while the mathematical school was <span style="color: #ff0000;">superIntcndcd </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eratosthenes </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Oyrene</span>, the founder of the science of<br/>
mathematical geography. At this period Alexandria was also the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">residence </span>of the orator Lycon of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Twas</span>, ofthe poets <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apollonius</span>, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lthodian</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">LycoPhron</span>, and of the great astronomer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cotton</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Notwithstanding</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the continual <span style="color: #ff0000;">disscnsions </span>among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
