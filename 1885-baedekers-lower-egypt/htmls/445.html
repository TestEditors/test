been so raised with deposits of the sand of the desert that the tomb<br/>
rather resembles a subterranean <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">structure </span>than a building on<br/>
the surface of the earth. Very little of the exterior is therefore<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>visible, but the interior, which has been completely excavated, is executed with the utmost care, and the sculptures on the<br/>
walls exhibit a skill <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is truly marvellous when it is remembered that the mausoleum was erected in the 5th Dynasty, in the<br/>
time of the builders of the pyramids of Abusir, that is, about 4500<br/>
years ago. Both the paintings and the hieroglyphics which cover<br/>
the walls are executed in remarkably delicate and flat <span style="color: #0000FF;">bas-relief</span>,<br/>
the outlines being sharp and distinct, while the projecting parts<br/>
are at the same time subdued and harmonious. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic<br/>
</span>canon (p. 161) has already imparted to the human figures a somewhat conventional type, notwithstanding their spirited action, but<br/>
there is a refreshing fidelity to nature in the attempts of the artists to represent animals. The painting of the figures is preserved<br/>
at places. Each of the larger scenes is presided over by the commanding figure of Ti himself, the proprietor of the tomb, who is<br/>
easily distinguishable by his <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftier </span>stature. He wears a <span style="color: #0000FF;">wig </span>with<br/>
the usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">looks</span>, and his features were doubtless copied from life,<br/>
as is proved by their resemblance to those of his statue now preserved at <span style="color: #0000FF;">13131515 </span>(p. 306). In some cases his chin is prolonged by<br/>
a small false beard. Around his loins he wears a kind of apron,<br/>
carefully folded, and pointed in front, and from his neck hangs a<br/>
broad necklace. With one hand he leans on a long staff, and in the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:5<br/>
</span>other he holds his baton of <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>. Ti hieroglyphic <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>, as the<br/>
<br/>
inscriptions in the tomb-chamber inform us (p. 396), was a dignitary of the highest rank in the service of Ra-nefer-ar-ka, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-enuser</span>, and Kaka, monarchs of the 5th Dynasty. He was a'semer'<br/>
(companion, adjutant, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">chamberlain</span>) of the king,'enthroned in<br/>
the heart of his lord', <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'master </span>of the secrets' (privy counsellor),<br/>
'loving his sovereign', a'president of the gate of the palace', a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'secret </span>counsellor of the king in all his royal assemblies', <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'secret<br/>
</span>counsellor for the execution of the commands of the king', and a<br/>
'president of all the royal works and the royal department of writing'. He also held a high sacerdotal <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>at the pyramids of Abusir <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>370), and he is elsewhere called one of the chiefs of the<br/>
prophets, a president of the sacrifices and <span style="color: #0000FF;">purifications</span>, and a<br/>
guardian of the mystery of the divine speech. His wife Neferhotep-s, who is frequently represented by his side, was a member<br/>
of the royal family, but he <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a man <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">humble </span>parentage,<br/>
who had risen to distinction by his merit. His sons Ti and Tamut<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Tamuz) enjoyed the title of princes in consequence of the high<br/>
rank of their mother. Like other Egyptian ladies of distinction, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">wife </span>of Ti is termed the'beloved of her husband', the'mistress of<br/>
the house', and the'palm of amiability towards her husband'<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
