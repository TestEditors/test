find nothing. The vessel containing the treasure is said to have<br/>
consisted of an emerald, and to have been taken by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mirm1n </span>to<br/>
Baghdad. Other fabulous stories are told of golden statues set with<br/>
jewels, amulets, talismans, and mummies, which were found here<br/>
in a golden cabinet, in a box in the form of a human figure, and in<br/>
a stone sarcophagus<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Malirizi </span>speaks of the sarcophagus which still<br/>
lies in the royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chamber </span>as in his time, and another author<br/>
says that its cover <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">words</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'Abu </span>Amad built the Pyramid<br/>
in 1000 days'.<br/>
<br/>
We possess no definite information concerning the <span style="color: #0000FF;">opening </span>of the<br/>
second Pyramid, but'Abdellatif, who was himself present, gives<br/>
us an account of the attempted destruction of the Third Pyramid.<br/>
As early as the reign of Saladin (<span style="color: #0000FF;">All </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1109-93</span>), the vizier <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karakdsh </span>used the Small Pyramids as a quarry for the material of which<br/>
he constructed various imposing <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>in Cairo, including the<br/>
Citadel. <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Melik </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'Aziz'Othman </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1193-99</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>), Saladin's successor,<br/>
was persuaded by his <span style="color: #0000FF;">courtiers </span>to demolish the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called'Ited </span>Pyramid', or that of Menkaura. The sultan accordingly organised a party<br/>
of workmen for the purpose, under the supervision of some of his<br/>
nobles, caused a camp to be pitched at the base of the Pyramid,<br/>
and ordered them to begin the work of destruction. After eight<br/>
months <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofincessant </span>labour, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the senseless undertaking,<br/>
which had cost enormous sums and prodigious exertions, had to be<br/>
abandoned.'Nothing was effected by the undertaking', <span style="color: #0000FF;">says'Abdellatif</span>,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'but </span>the shameful mutilation of the Pyramid, and the demonstration of the weakness and incapacity of the explorers. This<br/>
occurred about the year 593 of the Hegira <span style="color: #0000FF;">CA</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">D. </span>1196 ]. When<br/>
the stones that have been removed are regarded at the present day,<br/>
one would think that the structure had been entirely destroyed,<br/>
but when one then looks at the Pyramid itself, one sees that it has<br/>
suffered no material damage, and that a part of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation </span>has<br/>
been stripped off on one side only<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-- </span>The Pyramids were also used<br/>
as quarries at a later period, and even during the regime of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed'Ali</span>, who moreover is said to have been advised by a<br/>
prophet to destroy them. With the aid of gunpowder he might perhaps have succeeded in <span style="color: #0000FF;">effecting </span>what the workmen of the Khalif<br/>
had failed to do, had not his European friends represented to <span style="color: #0000FF;">him<br/>
</span>that the blasting operations would probably damage the city of Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The first modern traveller who carefully and successfully examined<br/>
the Pyramids was Nicholas Shaw in 1721; but he still entertained the<br/>
notion that the Sphinx had a subterranean connection with the Great<br/>
Pyramid. He was followed by Norden in 1737<span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pococke </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1723</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>who<br/>
gives a plan and dimensions; Fourmont in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hue</span>; Karsten Niebuhr in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1761</span>; Davison in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1763. </span>a most meritorious explorer, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>discovered many<br/>
new facts concerning the interior of the Great Pyramid; Bruce in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1768</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Volney </span>in 1783; Browne in 1792-98; Denon. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Culllell </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">umard</span>. and other<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">savauts </span>of the French expedition <span style="color: #0000FF;">under </span>Bonaparte in <span style="color: #0000FF;">17994801</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jnnmd<br/>
</span>in particular has the merit of having taken very accurate <span style="color: #ff0000;">measurements<br/>
</span>but he exhibited more ingenuity than good sense in attributing to the<br/>
proportions of the building a hidden <span style="color: #0000FF;">significance </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they cannot be<br/>
