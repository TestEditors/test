<span>Negroes. THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. 51<br/>

richer lowlands, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>to the large towns, and particularly to Alexandria, in quest of employment; and they find no <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>in<br/>
attaining their object, for they are generally active, intelligent, and<br/>
honest, while the older immigrants, who are strongly attached to their<br/>
country, are always zealous in procuring them work and rendering<br/>
them assistance. When the Berber has succeeded in amassing a<br/>
moderate fortune, he returns to settle in his native country, of<br/>
which throughout his whole career he never entirely loses sight,<br/>
and to which he frequently remits his hardly earned savings for the<br/>
benefit of his relations. The cold winter nights in Egypt are very<br/>
trying to the poor Barbers, who often have to sleep in the open air<br/>
outside the doors, and many of them are attacked by consumption.<br/>
They are most commonly employed as doorkeepers (<span style="color: #ff0000;">bawwdb</span>), as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">house-servants </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">khaddtm</span>), as grooms and runners (<span style="color: #0000FF;">stis</span>), for which<br/>
their swiftness renders them unrivalled, as <span style="color: #ff0000;">coachmen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'arbagi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">}</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cooks </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">{</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">talabakh</span>). Each of these <span style="color: #ff0000;">live </span>classes is admirably organised as a kind of guild, with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>of its own, who levies a<br/>
tax from each member, and guarantees the character and abilities of<br/>
members when hired. Thefts are very rarely committed by the<br/>
Nubians, but in cases of the kind the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>compels the whole of<br/>
his subjects to contribute to repair the loss, and cases have been<br/>
known in which several hundred pounds have been recovered in<br/>
this way. The result is that there is a strict mutual system of<br/>
supervision, and suspected characters are unceremoniously excluded<br/>
from the fraternity. Nubian women are seldom seen in Egypt.<br/>
[ <span style="color: #0000FF;">like </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berbers</span>, most of the negroes in Egypt<br/>
are professors of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islim</span>, to the easily intelligible doctrines of<br/>
which they readily and zealously attach themselves. Most of the<br/>
older negroes and negresses with whom the traveller meets have<br/>
originally been brought to Egypt as slaves, and belong to natives,<br/>
by whom they are treated more like members of the family than<br/>
like servants. Although every slave who desires to be emancipated<br/>
may now with the aid of government sever the ties which bind him<br/>
to his master, most of the negroes prefer to remain on the old footing with the family which supports them and relieves them of the<br/>
anxiety of providing for themselves. The eunuchs, who also belong<br/>
almost exclusively to the negro races, but are rapidly becoming<br/>
rarer, very seldom avail themselves of this opportunity of regaining<br/>
their liberty, as their emancipation would necessarily terminate the<br/>
life of ease and luxury in which they delight. The slave-trade is<br/>
now very rapidly approaching complete extinction in Egypt, not so<br/>
much owing to the penalties imposed (which the rapacious <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials<br/>
</span>take every <span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity </span>of enforcing<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as from changes in the mode<br/>
of living, and the growing preference of the wealthy for paid servants. Down to 1870 the trade was still carried on in secret with<br/>
some success, but since then it has been at a standstill. Since<br/>
1878 the government has kept a complete register of domestic<br/>
