<br/>
sumption of food was so large that the hospital employed several officials<br/>
for the sole purpose of buying provisions and keeping accounts. Besides<br/>
these <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>there were a number of others, whose duty it was to collect<br/>
the various revenues set apart for the support of the institution. In the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb-mosque </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">131111111 </span>and the religious traditions connected with it<br/>
were publicly <span style="color: #0000FF;">taught </span>the teachers and the pupils both being supported<br/>
by government. A large adjacent apartment contained the library, which<br/>
was well stocked with <span style="color: #0000FF;">exegetical </span>treatises on the Koran<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>books of traditions, grammars, and medical, <span style="color: #0000FF;">theological </span>legal, and literary works<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and<br/>
was kept in good order by a librarian and <span style="color: #ff0000;">live </span>assistants. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">schoolbuilding </span>contained four <span style="color: #0000FF;">lecture</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms </span>for the teachers of the four schools<br/>
of Mohammedanism (p. 149); and there was also a school for children,<br/>
where sixty orphans were maintained and educated gratuitously.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb- </span>chamber are still preserved articles of dress which once<br/>
belonged to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kalaun</span>, and are <span style="color: #ff0000;">populary </span>supposed to possess miraculous<br/>
virtues. Thus, the shawl (<span style="color: #ff0000;">'immelu </span>of his turban is supposed to cure<br/>
headaches, and one of his heavy <span style="color: #0000FF;">kaftans</span>, wrapped round the <span style="color: #0000FF;">body </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
patient for <span style="color: #0000FF;">24 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hours </span>is said to be an infallible remedy for ague. This<br/>
superstitious belief in the healing powers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sultan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>clothing is<br/>
probably due to the fact that he devoted much attention to medicine.<br/>

The Portal (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pl.1</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nos</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1-8 </span>are the only parts of the building<br/>
now preserved; the other numbers on the plan show the former<br/>
arrangements), the most interesting part of the whole edifice, is<br/>
constructed of black and white marble, and is of imposing height.<br/>
The doors still <span style="color: #0000FF;">show </span>traces of their former covering of bronze. The<br/>
ceiling of the entrance, with its open beams, is also very effective.<br/>
<br/>
The corridors, most of which are vaulted in the Gothic style,<br/>
appear to some extent to have lost their original regularity in<br/>
consequence of their restoration by Seyyid <span style="color: #0000FF;">tyr-Habit </span>and Ahmed<br/>
Pasha <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tither </span>during the present <span style="color: #0000FF;">century<br/>
<br/>
</span>The second <span style="color: #ff0000;">door </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">b</span>) on the right leads to the Vestibule<br/>
(Pl <span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>of the Tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kulm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'m</span>, now used as an <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>by the administrators of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wald</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>tomb itself contains a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>granite<br/>
column, and the lower parts of the walls are covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>mosaics<br/>
in marble. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bible </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prayer-recess </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, with its mosaics, its beautiful<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dwarf-arcades</span>, and its <span style="color: #0000FF;">shell-shaped </span>ornamentation, is also worthy<br/>
of notice. The disposition of the pairs of windows resembles that<br/>
which occurs <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Christian churches of the Romanesque period.<br/>
The stucco tracery with which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">windows </span>are filled should also <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
</span>inspected.<br/>
<br/>
Adjacent to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mfiristan </span>is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Tomb </span>of Sultan Mohammad<br/>
en-Nasir ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalafin </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">1293-1311</span>; Pl. 56), dating from 698 of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hegira</span>.<br/>

mentioned, <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>only <span style="color: #0000FF;">nine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">age </span>succeeded his elder brother<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhem </span>who is better known as El- <span style="color: #ff0000;">ishraf </span>(p. 255). At the beginning of<br/>
his reign sanguinary feuds broke out between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kethoga</span>, his <span style="color: #0000FF;">vicegerent</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shujai</span>, his vizier. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dee.12</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">%</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ketboga</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>having got rid of his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">antagonist </span>usurped the sceptre, but two years later was dethroned by<br/>
the discontented <span style="color: #0000FF;">emirs </span>and was succeeded by Lajin, son- -in-law of Bebars,<br/>
and once a slave of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kalaun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>who is said to have been a German by birth,<br/>
and to have been brought to <span style="color: #ff0000;">EU </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ypt </span>when ten years <span style="color: #0000FF;">old </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lajin </span>having<br/>
been assassinated in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jan.1299 </span>Nasir, who had meanwhile resided at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Korak</span>, a Syrian fortress to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">k </span>of the Dead Sea, was recalled. Although<br/>
he had gained several victories over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mongolians</span>, who were <span style="color: #0000FF;">threaten<br/>
