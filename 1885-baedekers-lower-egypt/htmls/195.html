</span>identical. <span style="color: #0000FF;">No </span>attention whatever was paid to tastefulness in grouping or uniformity of arrangement, the separate scenes being merely<br/>
placed beside or over each other; but, individually, these are remarkable for <span style="color: #0000FF;">distinctness </span>and excellence of execution, and they<br/>
afford us a far more vivid picture of the life of the ancient Egyptians, their customs, their wars, and their religious rites, than<br/>
any written chronicle could have <span style="color: #0000FF;">afforded</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>artistic finish, on the<br/>
other hand, these scenes are defective, and the colouring has no independent <span style="color: #0000FF;">value</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>being merely used to make the figures stand<br/>
out more distinctly, and imitating nature in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">crudest </span>possible<br/>
manner.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the province of artistic conception we find Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">imagination </span>fettered by traditional bonds which it made no effort to<br/>
break; but in the practice of the handicrafts Egypt was perfect.<br/>
The goldsmiths and workers in metal in particular had attained the<br/>
most complete mastery of their craft; they thoroughly understood<br/>
all its ancillary arts, such as enamelling and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Damasceue </span>work, and<br/>
they were thus able to produce works of a degree of finish such as<br/>
a highly civilised nation alone could execute and appreciate.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller should note the <span style="color: #0000FF;">signification </span>of some of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">SarrnBOLS </span>and SIGNS most commonly used in the ornamentation of the<br/>
<br/>
columns and other parts of the Egyptian temples. Thus, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>crook or shepherd's staff, the emblem of the leader or monarch;<br/>
a scourge, the symbol of kingly power. When both are <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>the hand of the same figure they perhaps import the power of<br/>
restraining and of urging onwards. Then a seal, the symbol<br/>
of life; Nilometer, the symbol of steadfastness; <span style="color: #0000FF;">H </span>the red<br/>
crown of Lower Egypt; <span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span>the white crown of Upper Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
<br/>
</span>the united crown of Upper and Lower Egypt; and the [<span style="color: #0000FF;">'rzeus<br/>
<br/>
</span>serpent. On diadems and suns was placed the emblem <span style="color: #ff0000;">205</span>. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Urzeus </span>serpent, possessing the power of life and death, was<br/>
<br/>
the emblem of kingly power. The sceptre, user, denoted authority of various kinds, power, wealth, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">victorious </span>strength. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is read <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span>, t'am, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">club</span>, indicates the name of<br/>
<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban </span>nomos; <span style="color: #0000FF;">v</span>, a basket, <span style="color: #0000FF;">signifies </span>a master; W, a<br/>
decorated basket, a festival, or solemn assembly, at which <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings<br/>
<br/>
</span>were made in such receptacles; <span style="color: #0000FF;">man</span>, an <span style="color: #0000FF;">ostrich</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">feather</span>, truth<br/>
