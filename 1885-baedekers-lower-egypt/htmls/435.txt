<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-mason </span>then converted these sketches with his chisel into <span style="color: #ff0000;">rclicf </span>figures, some of which were flat, while others <span style="color: #ff0000;">were </span>raised about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">21/2 </span>lines or more. Lastly the painter coloured these designs, the<br/>
most conspicuous tints being <span style="color: #0000FF;">black</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>reddish brown, pale brown,<br/>
yellow, light and dark blue, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">green</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Parts </span>of the design that<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">were </span>intended to be white were not painted, but left in the natural<br/>
colour of the stone. All the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colours </span>so far as they have been<br/>
chemically analysed, are earthy substances, and are beautifully<br/>
preserved, except in <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>where they have been too long exposed<br/>
to the sun and wind. The women are always painted ofa pale yellow colour, and the men of a reddish brown tint. The metals also<br/>
have their conventional colours, iron being blue, and bronze yellow<br/>
or red, while wood is painted brown, or, when in logs, greenish<br/>
grey. In painting animals the artists <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to imitate their<br/>
natural colours, and we accordingly find that the cows and calves<br/>
are black, brown, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dappled</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>On the death of the proprietor<br/>
of the tomb, his remains were deposited at the bottom of the<br/>
mummy-shaft, and the task of decorating the tomb was at an end,<br/>
so that the most perfect sculptures are to be seen in juxtaposition<br/>
with the mere designs in red chalk. If other members of the family died, their mummies were likewise deposited in the common<br/>
shaft, but no allusion to their history was recorded on the walls of<br/>
the principal chamber. An exception, however, was made in the<br/>
case of the widow of the deceased, whose statue was placed on the<br/>
W. side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chamber </span>beside that of her husband, as has<br/>
been done in the tomb of Ti. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is also worthy of remark that the<br/>
name of the proprietor of the tomb is always engraved in hieroglyphies on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>drum of the doorway and on that of a'stele'<br/>
fashioned in imitation of a door on the W. side of the tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>as in<br/>
the case of the tomb of Ti, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">358 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. In a number of the tombs it<br/>
has been observed that a single figure has been obliterated, while<br/>
the whole of the rest of the decorations are well preserved and<br/>
intact. The figures thus defaced are supposed to have been those<br/>
of dishonest servants, whose misconduct induced the family to<br/>
erase their portraits. At stated intervals, <span style="color: #ff0000;">onholidays</span>, and probably<br/>
also on the anniversary of the death of the occupant of the tomb,<br/>
the family was <span style="color: #0000FF;">went </span>to assemble in the decorated <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber<br/>
</span>and the anterior court, bringing <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">food </span>which they <span style="color: #0000FF;">eon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sumed </span>in honour of the deceased, while homage was done to the<br/>
statue by burning incense around it.<br/>
<br/>
The Rock Tombs, placed in long rows, and most of them excavated <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E. and S. slopes of the plateau, are in a far simpler<br/>
style than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas</span>, both in point of construction and of internal decoration; but they sometimes contain similar decorations,<br/>
particularly in Upper Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
