The <span style="color: #0000FF;">zim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lsee </span>p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">2391 </span>to which the traveller will most conveniently<br/>
obtain access are those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dancing </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Howling </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">pervishes</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
dancing <span style="color: #0000FF;">dervishes </span>are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">.llevlezris </span>after the founder of their order, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mole </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jeliil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ail-din </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-Ihimi </span>of Balkh in Persia (who <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourished </span>about <span style="color: #ff0000;">AJL<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>learned master. They perform their zikr within a circular <span style="color: #0000FF;">space </span>about<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>ft. in diameter and enclosed by a railing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>slow, measured tread the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">shekh </span>comes forward, followed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>dervish, and takes his seat on a carpet<br/>
opposite the entrance<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The other <span style="color: #0000FF;">dervishes </span>next enter the circle one after<br/>
another, in the order of their ages, wearing long gowns and conical <span style="color: #0000FF;">huts</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>They walk solemnly up to their superior, make him a profound <span style="color: #ff0000;">obeisanec</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">kiss </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>hem of his robe, and take up their position to his left. From<br/>
the galleries is presently heard a <span style="color: #0000FF;">rude </span>and weird kind of music, consisting of a single prolonged tone of a stringed instrument accompanied by<br/>
a flute and a human voice rising and falling in cadences. Time is beaten<br/>
by a tambourine. with varying rapidity and vigour. The singer recites<br/>
a hymn expressing the most ardent love of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goat </span>As soon as the singing<br/>
ceases. the dervishes rise, and walk in procession three times round the<br/>
circle, headed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shckh</span>. Each of them, <span style="color: #0000FF;">including </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>himself,<br/>
makes <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>low <span style="color: #0000FF;">how </span>in passing the spot from which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>has just <span style="color: #0000FF;">risen</span>.<br/>
They then resume their seats, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sbékb</span>. with closed eyes, and in a<br/>
deep, <span style="color: #ff0000;">scpulchral </span>voice, begins to murmur a prayer, in which the word<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Allfth </span>alone is audible. <span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>the prayer is over the dervishes divest<br/>
themselves of their gowns, under which they wear a long, loose, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lightcoloured </span>skirt or <span style="color: #0000FF;">kill</span>, reaching down to their ankles, and a more closely<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fitting </span>vest. They then present themselves before the shC-kh<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>each in his<br/>
turn, make him a profound <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohcisauce</span>, and begin to move slowly round<br/>
in a circle. They turn on the left foot, propelling themselves by touching<br/>
the waxed <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>time to time with the right<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Most </span>of them make about<br/>
forty gyrations per minute, but some of them accomplish <span style="color: #0000FF;">sixty </span>and even<br/>
more. The whole of the zikr is performed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dervishes </span>noiselessly,<br/>
with closed eyes, and outstretched arms, the palm of one hand being<br/>
turned upwards and the other downwards, and their <span style="color: #0000FF;">heath </span>either thrown<br/>
back or leaning on one side. During the dance soft strains of music are<br/>
heard, while the beat of the tambourine gradually accelerates, and the<br/>
skirts of the performers <span style="color: #0000FF;">fly </span>out in a wide circle. The tones of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lute<br/>
</span>become shriller and shriller, until on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>signal given by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span>the<br/>
music ceases, the dancers stop, cross their arms over their chests<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and<br/>
resume their seats. The dance is performed three times by all except<br/>
the superior. The latter, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Walk</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>several times noiselessly through<br/>
the midst of the dancers, who, although their eyes are closed, touch neither<br/>
him nor one another. The whole zikr <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupies </span>about an hour.<br/>
<br/>
The howling or <span style="color: #0000FF;">shunting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dervishes </span>perform their zikr in a kneeling<br/>
or crouching posture, with their heads and chests bent downwards. In<br/>
this attitude they sometimes remain for hours, incessantly shouting the<br/>
Muslim confession of faith--<span style="color: #ff0000;">'lzi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ilzihn</span>', <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, until they at length attain<br/>
the ecstatic condition, and finish by repeating the word <span style="color: #ff0000;">Int</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>i. <span style="color: #0000FF;">e.'he'<br/>
</span>Hind) <span style="color: #0000FF;">alone</span>. On the occasion of great festivals some of them fall into<br/>
a kind of epileptic convulsion, and foam at the mouth; but no notice is<br/>
taken of them, and they are left to recover without assistance. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>need<br/>
hardly <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>added that the European traveller will find these performances<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unpleasing </span>and painful.<br/>
