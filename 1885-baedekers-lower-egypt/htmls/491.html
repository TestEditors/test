<br/>
to two <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>monuments, bear Persian cuneiform and <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic </span>inscriptions. In the latter the name of Darius occurs. The<br/>
representations still preserved exhibit a curious combination of<br/>
Persian and Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">characteristics </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">winged </span>disk of the sun<br/>
of the Egyptians resembles <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Feruer</span>' of the Persian monuments.<br/>
The Persian <span style="color: #0000FF;">time </span>is adorned with the heads of two kings, opposite<br/>
to each other. The figures are in the Egyptian style, and between<br/>
the outstretched hands of each is an <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian'cartouche</span>', or frame<br/>
for the name of a king. One of the blocks bears <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>in<br/>
front (half obliterated) and cuneiform characters at the back.<br/>
<br/>
The Canal now enters what is called the Small Basin of the<br/>
Isthmus, which consists entirely of shell formations, and thence<br/>
leads into the Large Basin of the Bitter <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lakest </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">420 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. At<br/>
each end of the large basin rises an iron lighthouse, <span style="color: #0000FF;">60 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in<br/>
height. The water is of a bluish green colour. The banks are flat<br/>
and sandy, but a little to the left rises the not <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpicturesque<br/>
</span>range of the Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Genefl'eh </span>(p. 414). A little farther on (near the<br/>
89th <span style="color: #ff0000;">kilométre</span>) is the cutting which conducts the Canal through<br/>
the rocky barrier of the Serapeum. The railway station (p. 414) is<br/>
near the fresh-water canal. A flight of steps ascends to the top<br/>
of the left bank of the Canal. The village, which was founded in<br/>
1860, contains several pleasant little gardens.<br/>
<br/>
The ruins from which the station derives its name were formerly<br/>
supposed to have belonged to a Serapeum, which, according to the itinerary of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antonino</span>, once stood in this neighbourhood; but they can hardly<br/>
have belonged to a temple of Serapis or to any other sanctuary, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius </span>is doubtless right in pronouncing them to be the remains of a<br/>
third monument erected on the bank of the ancient canal by Darius<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>432). He found here a fragment of the wing of a disk in the Persian<br/>
style, a stone with cuneiform characters, and a third bearing <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>, all of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>his opinion<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The blocks of limestone lying<br/>
on the ground belonged to the pedestals of the monuments. The ruins<br/>
of the real Serapeum have been probably discovered in the remains of <span style="color: #ff0000;">a<br/>
</span>stone building, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>paces <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>E. to W.), and <span style="color: #ff0000;">63 </span>paces <span style="color: #ff0000;">bread<br/>
</span>(from N. to 8<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, situated about 1/4 M. to the S. of the 14th kilometre stone<br/>
on the fresh-water canal. Excavations made there have brought to light<br/>
a few Egypto-Roman antiquities, which probably once belonged to a<br/>
village connected with the Serapeum. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>accordance with the rule <span style="color: #0000FF;">regarding </span>the temples of Serapis, the village must have <span style="color: #0000FF;">lain </span>entirely beyond<br/>
the precincts of the sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
At the 85th <span style="color: #0000FF;">kilometre </span>is situated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tustin</span>, which is easily recognised by the whitewashed dome of the tomb of a certain <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shé'klt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ennedek</span>, a wealthy chief, who, after having made a pilgrimage to<br/>
Mecca, is said to have presented his cattle and his gardens to the<br/>
poor, and to have spent the rest of his life on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grebe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>Maryam<br/>
near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lake </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Timsih </span>in pious meditation. Excavations in the neighbourhood of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tustin </span>have led to the discovery of many interesting<br/>
fossil remains of large animals belonging to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">meiocene </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tertiary<br/>
