About 250 paces to the S.W. of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Step-Pyramid </span>is the Pyramid<br/>
of King Unas, which was opened in 1881 and has been made <span style="color: #0000FF;">accessible </span>to the public <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tank </span>of admission obtained from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Messrs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

entrance, now provided with an iron gate, was found closed by<br/>
gigantic blocks of sandstone, occupying the entire width of the<br/>
corridor, and by three doors of granite; and it required the expenditure of a vast amount of labour to remove these obstacles. The<br/>
interior contains two large chambers and a smaller one, the former<br/>
with a lofty pointed roof, the latter with a low and flat roof. The<br/>
two large chambers contain numerous funereal inscriptions, most<br/>
of them well preserved. The granite sarcophagus of the king, who<br/>
was a member of the 5th Dynasty, stands in the second chamber,<br/>
close to the wall. The three walls enclosing it are of oriental<br/>
alabaster and are adorned with brightly coloured paintings. The<br/>
stone beams of the ceilings do not rest on the side-walls, but are<br/>
separated from them by a considerable interval, thus relieving<br/>
them of an immense pressure (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">358 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The best coup <span style="color: #ff0000;">rl'oeil </span>of the inner construction of the pyramids<br/>
is obtained at the Pyramid of Pepi <span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">about </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3/4 </span>hr. to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>of<br/>
the village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>, which has been opened from the top (comp.<br/>

<br/>
The Serapeum. Standing on the terrace of Mariette's House,<br/>
we observe, immediately to the N., a sandy hollow, from which<br/>
rise several heaps of stone and <span style="color: #0000FF;">hillocks </span>of sand. These mounds<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mark </span>the site of the statues of the (<span style="color: #0000FF;">haw-Egyptian </span>period, standing on the walls which flanked the approach (Dromos) from the<br/>
Egyptian to the Greek Serapeum (see below). The statues <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">including </span>a marble Cerberus in the form of a lion with its tail terminating in a snake's head) are in a very mutilated condition, and<br/>
have been purposely covered with sand. <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">n </span>the W. side was<br/>
situated the Egyptian Serapeum, or Mausoleum of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apia</span>, the sacred<br/>
bull, which had spent its life in its temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Apieunfi </span>at Memphis<br/>
(p. 373), and after its death was buried in the vaults of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakhfira</span>.<br/>
Owing to an erroneous translation, the Greeks regarded Serapis as<br/>
a distinct Egyptian deity.<br/>
<br/>
The Dead <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apia</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Osiris</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Apis </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Asur-Hapi</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sammie</span>), is termed the<br/>
'reviving Ptah' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>126), and probably symbolised the perpetual regenerating<br/>
power of the god. So, too, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apia </span>was associated with the moon, which seems<br/>
to undergo hourly change<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>while remaining unaltered. llapi, the genius of<br/>
death, bears the head of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eynocephalus</span>, which was also <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>symbol of the<br/>
moon. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">File</span>, the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">regenerator </span>of the parched soil, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hure </span>the same<br/>
name <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hard</span>), and its rise was associated with the light of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">moon</span>,<br/>
which by one of its rays impregnated the cow which <span style="color: #0000FF;">bore </span>Apis<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>As the<br/>
embodiment of the soul of Osiris in the infernal regions, Apis was <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>principle which revives everything dead. The great festival of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rise<br/>
