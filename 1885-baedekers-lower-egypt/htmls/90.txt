trees, a boon which the country owes to the government of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">khcdive </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tsmaril</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The winters of <span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">same </span>years were also unusually<br/>
wet in Greece and other regions adjoining the Mediterranean where<br/>
but little rain generally falls, so that the weather of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">exceptional </span>seasons was doubtless affected by unknown <span style="color: #0000FF;">climatic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">extending </span>far beyond the limits of Egypt. The recent formation of the extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hitter </span>Lakes in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">isthmus </span>of Suez has<br/>
also no influence <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">climate </span>except in their own <span style="color: #0000FF;">immediate<br/>
</span>neighbourhood. If the <span style="color: #0000FF;">banks </span>of the lied Sea still remain desert in<br/>
spite of the huge evaporating <span style="color: #0000FF;">surface</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beside </span>them, what change<br/>
of importance could <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>expected from the artificial creation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>a<br/>
few square miles of water? The whole of the base of the Delta<br/>
lies within the region of the winter rains, which from January to<br/>
April are blown inland by the then prevailing <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-breezes </span>to a<br/>
distance of 30-50 English miles. <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper </span>Egypt, on the other<br/>
hand, rain is almost unknown, and it is not uncommon to meet<br/>
with adult natives who <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>never seen a single shower. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>that<br/>
part of the country a <span style="color: #ff0000;">tlmnder-shower</span>, or perhaps the extreme <span style="color: #0000FF;">fringe<br/>
</span>of the tropical rains, falls at rare intervals in April or May to the<br/>
no small wonder <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the natives. These showers are more frequent<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span>the first cataract, and they recur regularly a little to the N.<br/>
of New <span style="color: #ff0000;">Donhola </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span>" <span style="color: #0000FF;">V. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">latfi</span>), while to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>of Shendi<br/>
there is annually a short wet season<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">concomitants </span>of malaria<br/>
and fever<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rainfall </span>in the deserts on each side of the Nile is very<br/>
unequally distributed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>of these regions also it is approximately<br/>
true that rain is of very partial and sporadic occurrence. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thus </span>there<br/>
are vast tracts of the Libyan desert which for years together derive<br/>
their sole moisture from the damp north and north-westerly winds,<br/>
and when the wind is in any other quarter they are even deprived<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>their nightly refreshment of dew. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span>the Arabian side the case<br/>
is materially <span style="color: #0000FF;">different</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">There</span>, along the coast of the Red Sea, runs<br/>
a range of mountains <span style="color: #ff0000;">4800-10,0Ll0 </span>ft. in height, where occasional,<br/>
but very violent showers fall between <span style="color: #0000FF;">October </span>and December, hollowing out the deep valleys which descend to the Nile. Although<br/>
these desert rains are of too short duration permanently to affect<br/>
the character of the country<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>their fertilising <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>on the light and<br/>
loose soil is far greater than <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>they had to penetrate a heavier soil<br/>
covered with thick vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
As <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>year is divided in the valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Nile by the rise<br/>
and fall of the river into two <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-defined </span>seasons, one when the<br/>
soil is moist and easily cultivated, and the other when nothing<br/>
will grow without <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>irrigation, so also it may be divided<br/>
in accordance with the prevalent <span style="color: #0000FF;">WINDS </span>into two different periods<br/>
of eight and of four months. North winds prevail as a rule from<br/>
the middle of June to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">middle </span>of February, and south (<span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.15.<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">SAV</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>) during the rest of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>year (while in the lied <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sea </span>the<br/>
prevalent winds at these seasons are almost exactly in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reverse<br/>
