<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">451 </span>Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">8</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">TA </span>Towns of the<br/>
<br/>
Tunis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mendes</span>. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bullastis</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">thc </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">half-Semitic </span>cities of the Delta, it began<br/>
to decline <span style="color: #ff0000;">pcrccptibly</span>, although slowly. Flavius Josephus calls the place<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tramp-1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;</span>, or small town only, but Strabo and Stephanus of Byzantium<br/>
call it'the great<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the course of the frequent invasions in Egypt from<br/>
the E., Tanis was usually the first place which <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffered </span>after <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium</span>,<br/>
so that its ancient monuments were thus gradually destroyed, and the<br/>
edicts of Theodosius contributed not a little to the same result. The<br/>
work of destruction was finally completed in consequence of Turkish<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">misrule</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and'the </span>great Tanis' has thus dwindled down to the fishing<br/>
village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the sole attraction of which consists in the scanty ruins<br/>
in the neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
Ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tents</span>. The wall, built <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bricks </span>of Nile mud, <span style="color: #0000FF;">enclosing </span>the temple of Ramses 11., the sanctuary of which perhaps<br/>
existed as early as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">primaeval </span>monarchy, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">250 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">paces </span>long and<br/>
about 150 wide. The temple stood in the centre of the town, and<br/>
the latter lay on the slopes of hills which had been thrown up on<br/>
both sides of the temple, partly for the protection of the temple<br/>
itself, and partly to raise the houses above the level of the inundation (p. 410). Ascending a slight eminence close to the village,<br/>
we first reach a large and much mutilated colossal figure in granite.<br/>
We next come to a hollow made in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mariette's<br/>
</span>excavations, with solid <span style="color: #0000FF;">substructions </span>of huge blocks of limestone,<br/>
in the side of which there is a small chapel. Farther to the E.<br/>
another and larger fragment <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofrninwas </span>lately excavated, but, like<br/>
most of the remains mentioned below, it has again been covered<br/>
up with sand. Among the broken figures in black basalt lying<br/>
here is a female torso, a singular peculiarity of which is that the<br/>
left breast is much larger than the right. A damaged <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal<br/>
</span>figure, prostrate on the ground, is worthy of notice,'as it shows<br/>
that even granite monuments were painted<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>flesh parts of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanitic </span>coloured statues were painted bright pink, or almost<br/>
red, the eyebrows reddish brown, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'halantika</span>', or headdress<br/>
resembling a wig, yellow of various shades. Most of the statues<br/>
and blocks bear the name of Ramses II. The finest of those of the<br/>
early monarchy (such as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statue of Usertesen at Berlin)<br/>
are now deposited in different museums. The name <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenptah<br/>
</span>is also observed on a number of ruins, and so also is the cartouche<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sheshenk</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sesonchis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">22nd </span>Dynasty, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis</span>,<br/>
but only on those architectural fragments and statues which owe their<br/>
origin to <span style="color: #ff0000;">llamsesll</span>. Alittle farther <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the E. was probably situated<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hypostyle</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>hall of the temple, as is evidenced<br/>
by the broken columns lying on the ground, including several huge<br/>
shafts of granite, crowned with finely executed palm capitals. At<br/>
the bottom of the opening made by the last excavations, lie shattered <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>, colossal statues, capitals of columns, shafts, and<br/>
bases, in grand confusion. All these fragments are of granite,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">grauwacke</span>, or other hard stone. On a blackish <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>in a sitting<br/>
posture is inscribed the name of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>, who is here called<br/>
'lord of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">diadems</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'proteetor </span>of Egypt', <span style="color: #0000FF;">and'destroyer </span>of foreign<br/>
nations' The shaft of a huge column also bears the still <span style="color: #0000FF;">traceable<br/>
