and exacted obedience from his subjects as their lawful <span style="color: #ff0000;">lmzlm</span>, but had<br/>
repudiated any <span style="color: #0000FF;">homage </span>approaching to <span style="color: #ff0000;">deiticatirm</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>now<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>however,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">devoted </span>himself entirely to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ultra-Shi'ites</span>, who elevated him to the<br/>
rank of a god. He was persuaded <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>divinity <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>ihn <span style="color: #ff0000;">lsma'il<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">edmaraai</span>, a cunning Persian <span style="color: #0000FF;">seam</span>, who called on his people to recognise<br/>

subjects the <span style="color: #0000FF;">veneration </span>due to a god. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lslfun </span>became a matter of <span style="color: #0000FF;">indifference<br/>
</span>to him<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and he permitted the Christians and Jews who <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>embraced<br/>
the religion of the prophet to return to their former faith, although by<br/>
Mohammedan law such conduct was punishable with death. All the<br/>
suppressed churches and synagogues were re-established<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and their property<br/>
restored to them, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sumptuary </span>laws were repealed. At length, on<br/>
the night of 12th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feb. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1021</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">El- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilftkim </span>disappeared, having probably been<br/>
assassinated while taking <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>his nightly walks on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam<br/>
</span>hills.

consequence of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">sinfulness</span>, and that he will one <span style="color: #0000FF;">stay </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">appear </span>and be<br/>
worshipped by all nations as the last incarnation of the Deity.<br/>
<br/>
Until quite recently the greater part of the old mosque lay in<br/>
ruins, but the heaps ot'rubbish have now been removed or levelled,<br/>
so as to clear the great court for the reception of the building materials of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wald</span>. The central part of the sanctuary was restored,<br/>
as far as its advanced stage of dilapidation allowed, in order to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">contain </span>a museum of Arabian art, which will shortly be opened.<br/>
The court of the old mosque is to be occupied by a school of art.<br/>
<br/>
The whole building occupies an area about 400 ft. long and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">3:30 </span>ft. wide. The great court was adjoined <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the side next the<br/>
sanctuary by five aisles or arcades, on the W. by two, and on the<br/>
N. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>by three. These were supported by brick pillars, 10 ft.<br/>
high and <span style="color: #0000FF;">41/2 </span>ft. thick, <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrusted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>stucco. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pillars </span>are rounded<br/>
at the corners and bear pointed arches approaching the horseshoe<br/>
form. The ceiling and the wooden bolts were formed of the stems<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">date-palm</span>. The Cutie inscriptions and arabesques are of little<br/>
artistic value, and the entire structure was much less carefully and<br/>
artistically built than its model, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gami </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tulun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- On the N.<br/>
side of the mosque are two massive Mabkhara (p. 177), with bases<br/>
executed in the style of the Egyptian pylons. That at the N.E.<br/>
corner is connected with the old town-walls, the bastions of which<br/>
bear inscriptions dating from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French </span>occupation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1799</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Returning </span>to the lane by which <span style="color: #0000FF;">we</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>have come, we follow it to<br/>
the N., passing on the left an <span style="color: #ff0000;">okella </span>with an interesting gateway<br/>
enriched with stalactite decoration, and a facade adorned with<br/>
Arabian <span style="color: #0000FF;">wood-carving</span>. We now reach the<br/>
Bab en-Nasr, <span style="color: #ff0000;">or'Gate </span>of the Help of God', the plan of which<br/>
was probably derived from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span>castle of <span style="color: #ff0000;">liabylou </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">320</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>.<br/>
The ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">city-wall </span>to the W. connects this gate with the<br/>
similar Bab el-Futuh, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'Gate </span>of Victory". These two gates,<br/>
together with the fortified mosque <span style="color: #ff0000;">0f </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sultan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">llakim </span>situated <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>them (see above), formed a strong position for the troops<br/>
of Napoleon, "hose <span style="color: #0000FF;">cautions </span>have only recently been <span style="color: #0000FF;">removed<br/>
