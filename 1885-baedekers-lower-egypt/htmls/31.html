(6). Modes of Travelling in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">RAILWAYS</span>. A network <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">railways </span>constructed by the Egyptian<br/>
government now connects most of the important places in the Delta.<br/>
The engineer of the oldest of these lines, that from Alexandria to<br/>
Cairo, was Mr. Stephenson, and the others were planned by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fai</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bey</span>. The railways are under the management of a board of administration, the president of which is a native, while most of the<br/>
members are Englishmen or other Europeans. The carriages resemble those of other countries, but the third class is <span style="color: #0000FF;">insufferably<br/>
</span>dirty. The dust and heat render railway travelling in Egypt exceedingly unpleasant in hot weather.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller should be at the station fully half-an-hour before<br/>
the hour for starting, as the process of issuing tickets <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>booking<br/>
luggage is often very slow, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ticket-clerks </span>are entitled to<br/>
close the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>10 minutes before the departure of the train. Gold<br/>
coins that are in any degree either defaced or of light weight are<br/>
not accepted at the booking-office. The personal tickets are printed<br/>
in English and Arabic, the luggage tickets in Arabic only. The<br/>
hours of departure are seldom altered, and those at present fixed<br/>
are given in the following pages.<br/>

both in the narrow streets of the towns and on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bridle-paths<br/>
</span>in the country. They are of a much finer, swifter, and more<br/>
spirited race than the European, and at the same time patient and<br/>
persevering. Those in the towns are generally well saddled and<br/>
bridled in Oriental style. The attendants are either men or boysi,<br/>
who contrive to keep up with their beasts at whatever pace they<br/>
are going, and often address long sentences to them in their Arabic<br/>
patois. As the gait of the donkeys is sometimes very uneasy when<br/>
they break into a trot, care should be taken not to engage one with<br/>
this <span style="color: #0000FF;">defeat </span>for an excursion of any length. As the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stirrups </span>are<br/>
often in <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>condition they had better not be used at all. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-boys </span>(Arab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">hammc'zr</span>) are fond of showing off the pace of<br/>
their beasts, and often drive them <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpleasantly </span>fast. The rider<br/>
who prefers a slower pace <span style="color: #0000FF;">shouts'ala </span>mahlak <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'ula </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">muhlakum</span>; if<br/>
a quicker pace is wanted, yalla, yalla, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">mr'zsh'z</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, or salt <span style="color: #ff0000;">el- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lomdr</span>;<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">boys</span>, especially at Cairo, are generally remarkably active,<br/>
intelligent, and obliging. Many of the donkeys, particularly in the<br/>
country, will be observed to have been deprived of part of one or<br/>
both <span style="color: #0000FF;">ears</span>. This has been done, according to the somewhat cruel<br/>
practice of the country, as a punishment for trespass, an additional<br/>
<br/>

more exorbitant in their demands and less <span style="color: #0000FF;">obliging</span>, and even their<br/>
donkeys appear to partake of their unpleasant disposition<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
