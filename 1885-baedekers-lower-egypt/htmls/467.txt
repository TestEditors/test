</span>trees.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-- </span>The temple of Sekhet. the goddess revered here, was the most<br/>
important of the pilgrimage shrines in Lower Egypt; and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">joyous<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">licentious </span>festivals which were celebrated in honour of Hathor at<br/>
Dendera also took place here in presence of Bubastis, another form of<br/>
Isis Hathor, with similar <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificence </span>and riotousness.'The young men<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aven </span>(or <span style="color: #0000FF;">on</span>, p. 333) and of Pibeseth shall fall by the sword', says<br/>
Ezekiel (xxx. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IT</span>), when speaking of their idolatrous practices. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis<br/>
</span>was the Aphrodite of foreigners, the golden Cypris, and also the Artemis<br/>
of the Greeks; under the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">East </span>she was the Ashera, and under<br/>
that of Sekhet the Ashtaroth, of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phcenicians </span>(p. 136). The Upper<br/>
Egyptians celebrated their joyous festivals at Dendera during the first<br/>
half of the month corresponding to our October, and the Lower Egyptians probably held theirs at the same season, and also about the period<br/>
of our Christmas, on the 16th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khoiak </span>(Kiahk, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>commonly <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kiak</span>), the<br/>
'very auspicious<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>day dedicated to the goddess. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis </span>is represented<br/>
with the head of a lion or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">eat </span>(p. 137). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">eat </span>was sacred to her,<br/>
and, according to Herodotus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats </span>are said to have received honourable<br/>
burial at Bubastis.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'When </span>the Egyptians travel to Bubastis', says Herodotus,'they do so<br/>
in this manner. Men and women sail together, and in each boat there<br/>
are many persons of both sexes. Some of the women make a noise with<br/>
rattles, and some of the men blow pipes during the whole journey,<br/>
while the other men and women sing and clap their hands. If they<br/>
pass a town on the way, they lay <span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span>, and some of the women land and<br/>
shout and mock at the women of the place<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">While </span>others dance and make<br/>
a disturbance. They do this at every town that lies on the Nile; and<br/>
when they arrive at Bubastis they begin the festival with great <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and on this occasion more wine is consumed than during the whole<br/>
of the rest of the year. All the people <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">both </span>sexes, except the children,<br/>
make a pilgrimage thither, about 700,000 persons in all, as the Egyptians<br/>
assert.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>These ancient festivals are recalled to some extent by the<br/>
modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">merry-makings </span>at the fair of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tantra </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">226</span>).<br/>
<br/>
On leaving <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zakazik </span>the train runs round the town, into the<br/>
market of which we look down on the right. Immediately afterwards<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mansfira </span>line diverges to the left (p. 438). The fertile tract<br/>
which we now traverse is part of the Goshen of the Bible. During<br/>
the Turkish <span style="color: #0000FF;">regime </span>it fell into a miserable condition, and at the beginning of the century afforded a very scanty subsistence to barely<br/>
4000 Arabs; but the cultivation was so rapidly improved by means<br/>
of the fresh-water canal that it now supports upwards of 12,000<br/>
prosperous farmers and peasants. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Viceroy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id </span>Pasha ceded<br/>
this tract to the company <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>de Lesseps, but it was purchased<br/>
by his successor Isma'il Pasha for 10 million francs, erected into a<br/>
separate province, and garrisoned with cavalry.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goshen </span>of the Bible (Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gosem</span>) is frequently mentioned<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Noses</span>. Thus, in the Book of Genesis (xlv. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>), Pharaoh says to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Joseph</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'And </span>thou shalt dwell in the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goshen</span>, and thou shalt <span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">neat- </span>unto me, thou, and thy children, and thy children's children, and<br/>
thy flocks, and thy herds, and all that thou hast<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gem</span>. 28, <span style="color: #0000FF;">20<br/>
</span>'And he sent Judah before him unto Joseph, to direct his face unto<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Goshen</span>; and they came into the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goshen</span>. And Joseph made<br/>
ready his chariot, and went up to meet Israel, his father<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>to Goshen, and<br/>
presented <span style="color: #ff0000;">himselt </span>unto him<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. Gen. xlvii. 5, <span style="color: #0000FF;">G </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'And </span>Pharaoh spake<br/>
unto Joseph, saying, Thy father and thy brethren are come unto thee.<br/>
The land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>is before thee; in the best of the land make thy father and thy brethren to dwell; in the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'rushen </span>let them dwell<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
Gen. xlvii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">21</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'And </span>Israel dwelt in the land of Egypt, in the country<br/>
