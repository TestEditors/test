railway, and telegraph. The town suffered severely during <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabi's<br/>
</span>rising in 1882, and a great part of the European quarter was laid<br/>
in ashes by the fanatical natives. Owing to the continued state of<br/>
political uncertainty and the delay of the Egyptian government to<br/>
pay an indemnity, little has been done to repair the mischief, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>the spirit of enterprise seems for the time being <span style="color: #0000FF;">completely </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lamed</span>.<br/>

Gas AND <span style="color: #ff0000;">\VATER</span>. The city was provided with gas in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1805</span>, and is also<br/>
now well supplied with water. The old cisterns, the number of which<br/>
is said still to exceed a thousand, and the situation of which enables us<br/>
to determine the direction of the ancient streets, have been superseded<br/>
by the modern waterworks, completed in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1860</span>, which are supplied by the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nol1arrem-Bey </span>Canal, a branch <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llahmfidiych </span>Canal. The reservoir,<br/>
into which the water is pumped by steam, after having been filtered,<br/>

2000 vessels. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">um</span>, which was commercially a somewhat dull year,<br/>

Next in order are cotton-seed, grain, leguminous seeds, sugar,<br/>
and onions; and lastly we may mention the <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>unimportant items of<br/>
elephants' tusks, ostrich feathers, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mother-of-pearl</span>. England possesses<br/>
the lion's share of the trade and shipping, next in order coming France,<br/>

Alexandria now contains a population of upwards of <span style="color: #0000FF;">200,000<br/>
</span>souls, including at least 50,000 Europeans. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>its <span style="color: #0000FF;">palmy </span>days it<br/>
is said to have numbered more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-a-million </span>inhabitants,<br/>
