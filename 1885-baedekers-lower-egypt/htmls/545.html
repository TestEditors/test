<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span>frequent here, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">custom </span>requires that the bridegroom should purchase his bride from her father, the usual price being several <span style="color: #0000FF;">camels</span>,<br/>
and a certain sum of money, but the bargain is seldom concluded without protracted negotiations conducted by a third party. The girl is not<br/>
permitted to know anything of these negotiations between the father, the<br/>
suitor, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">match-maker </span>(khatib); and if she should happen to have<br/>
been <span style="color: #ff0000;">awitness </span>of them, decorum requires that she should retire into the<br/>
mountains, though only for a few hours. Some tribes require that she<br/>
should remain among the mountains for the three days preceding the<br/>
marriage, but among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tawara </span>she spends them in a tent erected beside<br/>
that of her father, whence she is removed to the dwelling of her future<br/>
husband. It occasionally happens that the girl flees of her own accord<br/>
to the mountains, and seriously resists and throws stones at an unacceptable<br/>
suitor (comp. p. 497). Each tribe has a <span style="color: #0000FF;">shekh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>or chief, a title of honour<br/>
which is also sometimes applied to the older and most respected<br/>
members of the community. The dress of these <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>is very<br/>
simple. They wear a <span style="color: #ff0000;">tarbfish </span>or a turban, and a grey gown fastened<br/>
with a girdle round the waist. <span style="color: #ff0000;">ln </span>cold weather they wear a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hut-nous<br/>
</span>of coarse material; many of them are bare-footed, but the wealthier<br/>
wear sandals of camel-leather. Their usual weapons consist of <span style="color: #ff0000;">sabres </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and<br/>
</span>knives; the guns they <span style="color: #0000FF;">use </span>for hunting are of great length and simple<br/>
construction. They neither <span style="color: #0000FF;">nae </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bursa</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>nor <span style="color: #0000FF;">latices</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but the men often<br/>
carry staves, which are still made in the form of the Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">c</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">C.<br/>
</span>From their girdles usually hang amulets, tinder, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>tobacco pipes.<br/>
Those tribes<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>with whom the traveller chiefly comes in <span style="color: #0000FF;">contact</span>, call<br/>
themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tawara </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tdr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and are generally honest. The<br/>
principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">subdivisions </span>of this tribe are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sibjaneddér</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mezénch</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shell</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sawaliha</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saetdiyeh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Awfirimeh</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Alékét</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">RMantyeh</span>, and<br/>
Shahin. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bcduins </span>of the E. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>, and particularly <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rAlewin</span>,<br/>
are wild, warlike, and insolent. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tiy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sheb</span>, who conduct the traveller<br/>
from Nakhleh to Hebron, are less objectionable. With regard to the<br/>
servants of the monastery (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebeliyehl</span>, and the families dependent on them,<br/>
who are settled in the oasis <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Firan </span>and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ta </span>see p. 503. Each tribe<br/>
has its particular district, the boundaries of which are indicated by stones<br/>
at doubtful points. These <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bednins </span>have long professed <span style="color: #ff0000;">E1-lslttm</span>, but<br/>
know little or nothing of the Prophet and his religion. They are seldom<br/>
seen to pray, but they celebrate festivals to <span style="color: #0000FF;">gem</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muse </span>(Moses), their<br/>
national saints, and sacrifice victims in their honour (see pp. 500, 520).<br/>
History <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Peninsula. The history of this region is as old as that of<br/>
Egypt itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>for we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>that the first Pharaoh, of whose reign we<br/>
possess contemporaneous monuments bearing inscriptions (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Snefru</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;">signaliscd </span>himself as the conqueror of these mountain tribes, and the discoverer of the mines. The mines in the desolate <span style="color: #ff0000;">TViidi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Maugham </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">101</span>) and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sarbfit </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Khidem </span>(p. 522) were worked by Egyptians more than 5000<br/>
years <span style="color: #ff0000;">ago</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and copper, malachite, and turquoises were <span style="color: #0000FF;">brought </span>thence to<br/>
the treasury of Memphis. Down to the time ofthe invasion of Egypt by<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">11'305 </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">88 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, we learn that the peninsula was dependent on the<br/>
Pharaohs, and was impoverished for their advantage<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Whilst </span>the latter,<br/>
having been supplanted by the new masters of Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">maintainer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>themselves in the S. part of the valley of the Nile, it seems that the working<br/>
of the mines was suspended, and that the mountain tribes succeeded in<br/>
shaking off the yoke of their <span style="color: #ff0000;">oppressors</span>. Immediately after the expulsion<br/>
of the Hyksos, these tribes were subjugated anew by the powerful <span style="color: #0000FF;">monarchs </span>of the 18th Dynasty, who conquered all the states adjoining Egypt on<br/>
the East. This is proved by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">insstrlptiurtsorSirsrln</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">4 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eHKhftdem</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>extending<br/>
down to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">20111 </span>Dynasty. The names <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>springs, mountains, and valleys,<br/>
resemble those of the Book of Exodus; and the Biblical traditions, which<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>attach to them, doubtless owe their origin to the Christians<br/>
who settled at an early period in this wilderness. With regard to the<br/>
battle with the Amalekites, and Mount Sinai as the scene of the promulgation of the law, see <span style="color: #0000FF;">p.481 </span>et seq. We may, however, remark here, that<br/>
the Israelites of a later period never made pilgrimages from Palestine to<br/>
the sacred mount, and that, throughout the Mosaic writings, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Elijah<br/>
