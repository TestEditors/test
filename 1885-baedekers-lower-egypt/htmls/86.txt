<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II'he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oases </span>always lie at a considerably lower level than the stony<br/>
plateau of the desert, them <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesque </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rocky </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">precipices</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oasis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Siwa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>about 78 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>below the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-level</span>. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hat </span>surfaces of these depressions do not always <span style="color: #0000FF;">form </span>a single<br/>
cultivated area, but consist, even in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of the smallest oases like<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Farfifra</span>, of a number of comparatively small <span style="color: #0000FF;">parcels </span>of cultivable soil,<br/>
separated by belts of sterile ground. One of the large <span style="color: #0000FF;">oases</span>, like that<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khargch</span>, when surveyed <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the neighbouring heights, presents the<br/>
appearance of a large expanse of desert, <span style="color: #0000FF;">decked </span>with isolated spots of<br/>
light and dark green, the former being fields of corn and other crops.<br/>
and the latter palm-groves. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">111111111 </span>of vegetation, the extent of<br/>
which depends on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">copiousness </span>of the springs in their midst and the<br/>
amount of care used in the distribution of the water, have <span style="color: #0000FF;">often </span>since<br/>
the time of Strabo been not inaptly compared to the spots <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>a panther's skin, but the simile applies to the oases individually, and not to<br/>
those of the Libyan desert as a whole, as they are but few in number<br/>
and very far apart.<br/>
<br/>
As already observed, these Libyan <span style="color: #0000FF;">oases </span>owe their fertility to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">copiousness </span>of their water supply. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lnexhaustible </span>subterranean channels,<br/>
or an immense reservoir, perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">common </span>to all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">oases</span>, are believed<br/>
to connect them with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nub </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">art </span>Nile, or possibly with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">id </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and<br/>
of this supply it is probable that a very limited portion only comes to<br/>
the surface in the form of springs<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Within </span>the last thirty <span style="color: #0000FF;">1-L11-1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.11.111F</span>, a well-digger from the valley of the Nile, and formerly servant<br/>
to a French engineer, has sunk about sixty new wells in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>oasis of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Uzikhel</span>, some of which, though close to older wells<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>do not seem to diminish the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cupiousness </span>of the latter. With the aid of this additional<br/>
supply a large area of sterile soil <span style="color: #0000FF;">1111 </span>been brought under cultivation, and<br/>
it is therefore probable that by means of Artesian wells, such as those<br/>
sunk <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the French in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Algerien </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oases</span>, the extent of the cultivable soil<br/>
might still <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>largely increased. The high temperature of the water,<br/>
both in the natural springs and in the wells, shows that it comes from<br/>
a great depth; and it is strongly impregnated with mineral ingredients,<br/>
as in the case of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bath-springs </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dakhc </span>] and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bahriyeh </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">07° </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">FahrJ</span>,<br/>
and the beautiful sun-spring <span style="color: #0000FF;">CAin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1Jiunmiim</span>) at <span style="color: #0000FF;">311111 </span>(85°), the curative<br/>
properties of which, <span style="color: #0000FF;">owing </span>to their remote <span style="color: #0000FF;">situation</span>, are seldom utilised.<br/>
At Bahriyeh the stratum from which the water more immediately bursts<br/>
forth seems to lie at no great depth below the surface of the soil. The<br/>
thermal waters of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Daikhel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">contain </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iron</span>, and, like <span style="color: #ff0000;">those </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ifra </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khargeh</span>, are not unpleasant to drink when cooled; but the water of<br/>
Siwa is brackish and nauseous to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">taste </span>The wells are generally<br/>
very deep <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">9052011. </span>and upwards), and in ancient times the inhabitants<br/>
of the oases, as we are informed by Olympiodorus, were celebrated for<br/>
their skill in sinking them. The invasion of the Arabs, however, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>by several centuries of <span style="color: #0000FF;">barbarism</span>, during which the art of boring<br/>
wells was well nigh forgotten; many wells were filled up, and extensive<br/>
tracts of cultivated land, still traceable by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">11111111 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11111 </span>of the fields,<br/>
were abandoned; but, as above mentioned, the practice is beginning to be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">revived </span>The considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">force </span>with which the water comes up from<br/>
its profound reservoirs enables the inhabitants to construct wells <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>dams <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the highest parts of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">oases</span>. The fields are always<br/>
arranged in terraces of picturesque appearance, over which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fertilising </span>element is conducted downwards in succession, so that the laborious<br/>
system of <span style="color: #ff0000;">sibiyehs </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">shaddfs </span>used in the valley <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile is dispensed<br/>
with. Among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">southern </span>oases, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the other hand, we frequently observe extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-conduits</span>, carried by artificial <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankment</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">long<br/>
</span>distances for the purpose of <span style="color: #0000FF;">conveying </span>the precious liquid <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>sterile salt ground <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">good </span>soil, or necessitated by the requirements <span style="color: #ff0000;">1f </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">curiously </span>involved rights of property<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>These conduits <span style="color: #0000FF;">nut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unfrequently<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ernss </span>each other at <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>levels. The springs are generally the <span style="color: #0000FF;">property </span>of the communities, rarely that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>wealthy individuals; and it is<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">proportion </span>to their number, and that of the date-palms, that the inhabitants have to pay taxes, while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">soil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">itself </span>is nominally free<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
