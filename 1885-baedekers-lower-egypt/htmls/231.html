History. Alexandria was founded in B.C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">332 </span>by Alexander<br/>
the Great, forming a magnificent and lasting memorial ofhis Egyptian campaign. With the foundation of the city are associated a<br/>
number of legends to the effect that the coast, opposite the island<br/>
of Pharos, was specially pointed out by divine omens to the Macedonian <span style="color: #0000FF;">monarch </span>as a suitable site for the foundation of a new<br/>
seaport. i In the time of Alexander there were several harbours on<br/>
the N. coast of Egypt. The most important were those of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Naueratis</span>,<br/>
at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Genome</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>mouth <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>used by Greek vessels<br/>
after the 26th Dynasty (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">92 </span>], and Tanis and Pelusium on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>. side of the Delta, at the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">embouchures </span>bearing the same<br/>
names, to which Egyptian and <span style="color: #ff0000;">thnician </span>vessels only seem to<br/>
have been admitted. Alexander, who had overthrown the barriers<br/>
which had hitherto separated the nations dwelling on the E.<br/>
shores of the Mediterranean, conceived the plan of founding a<br/>
new and splendid seaport town in Egypt, both to facilitate the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flow </span>of Egypt's wealth towards Greece and the Archipelago, and<br/>
to connect the venerable kingdom of the Pharaohs with that<br/>
widely extended Greek empire which it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>his great ambition<br/>
to found. The site chosen by the king was not, however, an<br/>
entirely new one. On the coast opposite the island of Pharos<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">2080</span>, as we learn from the monuments, had long stood the<br/>
Egyptian village of Rhakotis, where, as Strabo records, a guard<br/>
was posted to ensure the safety of the frontier. It seems strange<br/>
at first sight that the new seaport should have been founded at<br/>
the W. extremity of the coast of the Delta instead of on the old<br/>
harbour of Pelusium at the E. end, which lay close to the Red Sea<br/>
and to the caravan route between Egypt and Syria, and might easily<br/>
have been extended so as to suit Alexander's requirements. The<br/>
fact is, however, that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">far-seeing </span>founder really made a most<br/>
judicious choice; for it has been recently ascertained that a current<br/>
in the Mediterranean, beginning at the Strait of Gibraltar, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Washes<br/>
</span>the whole of the N. African coast, and, when it meets the waters of<br/>
the Nile, it carries the vast deposits of the river towards the E., and<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>A venerable old man is said to have appeared to the king in a dream<br/>
and to have repeated to him the following lines from Homer (0d. iv. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>, 55):<br/>
'One of the islands <span style="color: #0000FF;">He</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>in the far-foaming waves of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">seat<br/>
<br/>
</span>Opposite Egypt's river<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and its name is <span style="color: #0000FF;">leros</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>.<br/>
The following incident was also regarded as a favourable omen. As Dinocrates, the king's architect, was marking out the plan of the town and<br/>
the sites of the principal buildings, the white earth used for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">purpose </span>ran short<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and he supplied its place <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the flour belonging to his<br/>
workmen. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">flour </span>soon attracted numerous birds, by which it was<br/>
speedily devoured, whereupon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aristander </span>pronounced this incident to be a<br/>
prognostication of the future wealth and commercial prosperity of the city<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
