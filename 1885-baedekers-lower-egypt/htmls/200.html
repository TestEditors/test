colonnades used for scholastic purposes, is frequently adorned with<br/>
detached columns, which is not the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>with the religious <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Interiors of the mosques, on the other hand, are freely<br/>
embellished with columns, the court being usually bordered by a<br/>
colonnade, which is doubled or trebled on the side next the <span style="color: #ff0000;">prayerniche </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">laibla</span>).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>presents no example of a distinct Arabian order of column,<br/>
and hardly a <span style="color: #0000FF;">single </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabian </span>capital, those actually executed by Arabs<br/>
(such as those adjoining <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prayer-recess </span>of the mosques) being<br/>
imperfectly developed, and copied from Byzantine and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemalan<br/>
</span>models. The form of capital which seems peculiar to Cairo is very<br/>
simple and is also used as a base. Proceeding from the four corners<br/>
of the abacus in curved <span style="color: #0000FF;">lines </span>are four surfaces which unite below<br/>
with the ligature of the round or octagonal column. The numerous<br/>
columns which adorn the mosques and private houses originally<br/>
belonged, almost without exception, to Roman or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolennean </span>structures, and sometimes to Christian churches. The Mohammedans<br/>
did not, however, employ columns belonging to the ancient Egyptian<br/>
temples unless they had already been remodelled and used in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek<br/>
</span>or Roman structures. Thus the Roman pedestals with remains of<br/>
hieroglyphics occasionally seen in the mosques must originally have<br/>
belonged to Egyptian temples. The architects of the mosques <span style="color: #0000FF;">collected </span>the columns they required for their purpose with little regard<br/>
to their dimensions. If they were too short, a pedestal, or a reversed capital was placed beneath them, regardless of the order to<br/>
which it belonged. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ionic </span>and Corinthian columns are mingled <span style="color: #0000FF;">promiscuously</span>, and a certain degree of uniformity in the architecture<br/>
is only observed when the abacus is reached. On this last lies a<br/>
second abacus of sycamore wood secured by a wooden bar, from<br/>
which lamps are frequently suspended.<br/>
<br/>
The arches of the Arcades are almost invariably pointed, being<br/>
at first round<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>while their sides go <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>at a tangent near the top; or<br/>
they gradually assume the <span style="color: #0000FF;">keel-shape</span>, being slightly curved inwards<br/>
below in the shape <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>horseshoe. There are also other forms which<br/>
approach still more nearly to the Gothic pointed arch; and there<br/>
seems little doubt that this form, so early and so generally employed<br/>
at Cairo, was exported thence to Sicily, and became <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>type which<br/>
afterwards extended to Northern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Europe </span>Beyond this resemblance<br/>
in the form of the arch, however, and in some of the details of<br/>
the windows, the pointed style possesses nothing in common with<br/>
the Arabian. The Gothic gateway of marble between the mosques<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">lialafin </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barlsulsiyeh </span>(p. 278) in the Derb <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Nahhasin </span>must,<br/>
therefore, be regarded as a work executed under European <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence</span>. The popular account of it is that it was brought from<br/>
some island.<br/>
<br/>
The arcades of the mosques and other spacious halls are covered<br/>
with a flat Ceiling of open-work, of almost uniform height. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
