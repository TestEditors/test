<br/>
The barrier, which consists <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>huge bridge with lock-gates, built<br/>
across the the Nile at the S. extremity of the Delta, about 12 M.<br/>
below Cairo, dates from the time of the energetic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohamrned'Ali<br/>
</span>and was constructed from the plans of a French engineer named<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Monget-Bey</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Fortifications of considerable strength were constructed here by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sam </span>Pasha for the purpose of arresting the progress of any invading army, and storing munitions of war. The place was therefore<br/>
called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sa'idZyeh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id</span>'s Castle<span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but is now known <span style="color: #ff0000;">as'Kunatir</span>' (bridges).<br/>
<br/>
The object of the Barrage was to keep the water of the Nile at<br/>
the same level in all seasons, so that the necessity for irrigation<br/>
machinery throughout the district below it would have been entirely<br/>
superseded, while those fields to the S. of it which are on a level<br/>
with the reservoir would also have benefited. The Barrage was also<br/>
intended to remove the difficulties of navigation below this point<br/>
during the three months when the Nile is at its lowest. During<br/>
that period the water is too shallow for large vessels, and even<br/>
small vessels are often impeded by shoals and shifting sandbanks;<br/>
and it was therefore proposed that the whole of the communication<br/>
by water should then be kept up by means of large canals.<br/>
<br/>
The first trial of the Barrage was unsuccessful<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>when the gates<br/>
were closed to retain the water, part of the work gave way and it<br/>
was hastily concluded that the whole undertaking was a costly<br/>
failure. For the next twenty years the Barrage was nothing but an<br/>
impediment to the navigation, as vessels often take several hours<br/>
to effect the passage of the locks, which is sometimes even attended with danger, and have to pay heavy dues. At the beginning of<br/>
1883, however, it was carefully tested by two English engineers,<br/>
who came to the conclusion that the Barrage might not be so wholly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unfitted </span>for its intended purpose as had been generally taken for<br/>
granted. As the Nile fell, they <span style="color: #ff0000;">accordinglylowered </span>the gates inch<br/>
by inch, and found that no untoward results ensued. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the contrary<br/>
the water at the Barrage only fell 10 inches while it fell 57 inches<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assufin</span>, and the fellahin were enabled to irrigate their fields<br/>
without recourse to the expensive steam-pumping apparatus on<br/>
which they had previously been dependent. It would, however,<br/>
be rash to make a prophecy from the successful experiment of a<br/>
single year, and the engineers who conducted it are of the opinion<br/>
that an expenditure of <span style="color: #ff0000;">QUOOOOL </span>would be necessary to make the<br/>
Barrage quite secure. As yet, also, no barrier has been constructed<br/>
for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damietta </span>branch of the Nile; and for the complete success<br/>
of the scheme this, of course, would be essential. Comp. the map<br/>
