HISTORY. 107<br/>
<br/>
Ibrahim Pasha, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moltammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli</span>'s adopted son, had already taken the reins of government, in consequence of<br/>
Mohammed's incapacity, in January 1848, but he <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lied </span>in<br/>
November of the same year, and before his adoptive father.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Abbfis </span>Pasha, a son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'usrln </span>Pasha and grandson of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli</span>, has generally been described by Europeans<br/>
as a brutal, vicious, and rapacious prince. This, however,<br/>
would seem to be a somewhat distorted view of his character,<br/>
arising from the fact that he had inherited from his Arab<br/>
mother a certain amount of ferocity and even cruelty, coupled<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the dislike of a true son of the desert for European innovations. He, however, maintained the strictest discipline<br/>
among his <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, and the public security in Egypt was<br/>
never greater than during his reign. His death is attributed<br/>
to assassination.<br/>
<br/>
Sa'id Pasha, his successor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>rAli's third<br/>
son. Thanks to his enlightened government and his taste<br/>
for European civilisation, Egypt made considerable progress<br/>
during his reign, although her <span style="color: #0000FF;">finances </span>were far from being<br/>
in a satisfactory condition. He <span style="color: #ff0000;">equalised </span>the incidence of<br/>
taxation, abolished monopolies, improved the canals, completed the railways from Cairo to Alexandria and to Suez,<br/>
and, above <span style="color: #ff0000;">all</span>, zealously supported the scheme of M. Ferdinand <span style="color: #0000FF;">do </span>Lesseps for constructing a canal through the Isthmus of Suez, which was opened in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1860 </span>under his successor.<br/>
During the Crimean war he was obliged to send an auxiliary<br/>
army and considerable sums of money to the aid of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Porto</span>. He died on 18th Jan. 1863, and was succeeded by<br/>
his <span style="color: #ff0000;">nephew<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Isma'il </span>Pasha, the second son of Ibrahim Pasha, who was<br/>
born on <span style="color: #ff0000;">that </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Dec. </span>1830. He had received the greater part<br/>
of his education in France and had there acquired the strong<br/>
preference for European institutions which characterised<br/>
him throughout his <span style="color: #0000FF;">reign </span>Unfortunately, however, he combined with this enlightenment a profound egotism and a<br/>
tendency to duplicity and cunning, which in the end<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>in<br/>
spite of his natural talents, proved his ruin. Most of his<br/>
innovations, such as the foundation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactories </span>and the<br/>
construction of canals, railways, bridges, and telegraphs,<br/>
were planned mainly in his own interest, though of course<br/>
the country shared in the advantage, while even in the establishment of schools, the reorganisation of the system of<br/>
justice (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">G</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, and the like, he acted rather with an eye<br/>
to produce an impression in Europe than from real concern<br/>
for the needs of his subjects. As time went on he succeeded<br/>
in appropriating for his own use about one-fifth of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cultivable </span>land of Egypt. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1866</span>, in consideration of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">large<br/>
