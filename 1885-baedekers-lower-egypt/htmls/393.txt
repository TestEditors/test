<br/>
sandy plain in a finished <span style="color: #0000FF;">condition </span>The Egyptians attempt partly<br/>
to explain this by the miraculous story that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankment</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>consisted of salt and saltpetre, and that they were melted by an<br/>
inundation; that they thus disappeared, while the solid building<br/>
remained. But this was not really the case; it was more probably<br/>
the same number of human hands employed in throwing up the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">embankments </span>which removed them and cleared the ground. It is<br/>
said that 360,000 men were compulsorily employed in the work,<br/>
and that the whole was scarcely completed within a period of<br/>
twenty <span style="color: #0000FF;">years'l</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>'On the death of this king, his brother Chephren succeeded to<br/>
the throne. He reigned fifty-six years. According to others the<br/>
successor was not a brother of the last king, but a son of his, named<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Chabryis</span>. In this, however, all the accounts agree, that, imitating<br/>
his predecessor, he erected the second pyramid, which is indeed as<br/>
artistically built as the first, but is not nearly so large, each side<br/>
of the area being a stadium only (193 yds.)... The kings had<br/>
built these pyramids as tombs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and yet neither of them is buried<br/>
in them. For they were so hated on account of the excessively<br/>
laborious work imposed by them and their many cruelties and<br/>
oppressions, that the people threatened to drag their bodies from<br/>
their tombs with derision and to tear them to pieces. Both, therefore, commanded their relatives, before their deaths, to bury them<br/>
quietly in some unknown place.'<br/>
<br/>
'These kings were succeeded by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Myeerinns </span>(whom some call<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1leneuerinus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>a son of the builder of the first pyramid. He resolved<br/>
to erect a third pyramid, but died before the work <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>finished.<br/>
Each side of the area he made 300 feet long. He caused the sides<br/>
to be constructed, up to the fifteenth tier, of black stone, resembling the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theban</span>. For the completion of the remaining part he<br/>
employed the kind of stone which had been used for the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">pyramids </span>Although this work is inferior to the others in point of<br/>
size, it is superior in its much more artistic construction <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>its<br/>
valuable stone. The name <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofMycerinns</span>, the builder of the pyramid,<br/>
is inscribed on its N. side.'<br/>
<br/>
'This king is said to have abhorred the cruelty of his predecessors, and to have <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to be courteous to every one and<br/>
to become the benefactor of his subjects. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>said to have sought<br/>
in every possible way to gain the affection of his subjects, and<br/>
among other things to have presented large sums at the public<br/>
courts of law to honest people who were thought to have lost their<br/>
causes <span style="color: #0000FF;">undeservedly</span>. There are three other pyramids, the sides of<br/>
which are <span style="color: #ff0000;">900 </span>feet <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>In their whole construction they resemble<br/>
the others, but not in size. The three kings already named are<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>These <span style="color: #0000FF;">300,000 </span>workmen <span style="color: #0000FF;">la </span>number perhaps based on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">360 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">days<br/>
</span>of which the old Egyptian year consisted)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>like the 100,000 men <span style="color: #0000FF;">vi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hern</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lotus</span>, who were relieved every three <span style="color: #0000FF;">months</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>are doubtless <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mere </span>myth<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
