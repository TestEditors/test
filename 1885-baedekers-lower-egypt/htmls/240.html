<br/>
</span>The first great persecution of the Christians, which took <span style="color: #0000FF;">place<br/>
</span>in the reign <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofDeeims </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">250</span>), was a terrible blow to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrians</span>.<br/>
The city had for a considerable time been the seat of a bishop, and<br/>
had since <span style="color: #ff0000;">190 </span>possessed a theological school, presided over by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">l'anta-nus </span>and at the beginning of the 3rd <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>. by Clement of<br/>
Alexandria, who <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to combine Christianity with the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Neo-Plat0nisuo </span>which sprang up about this period at Alexandria<br/>
and was taught by Ammonius <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sauces</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Herennius</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Plotinus</span>, Porphyrins, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jamblichus</span>, and others. A second persecution <span style="color: #0000FF;">took </span>place<br/>
in 257, during the reign <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Valerian</span>; and shortly afterwards, in the<br/>
reign of Gallienus, the plague carried off a large portion of the<br/>
population. The incessant revolts which broke out in Alexandria<br/>
and other parts <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflflgypt </span>led repeatedly to the elevation of usurpers<br/>
and rival emperors to the throne. Thus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Firmns </span>was proclaimed<br/>
emperor at Alexandria as a rival <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofAurelian</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Probus </span>owed the<br/>
purple mainly to the Egyptian legions<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Alexandrians afterwards revolted against Diocletian and declared themselves in favour<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Achilleus</span>; but Diocletian besieged the city, took it by storm,<br/>
and chastised the inhabitants with great severity.<br/>
<br/>
Christianity, however, still continued to gain ground, and Alexandria was even regarded as the chief seat of Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">erudition<br/>
</span>and of the orthodox faith. The dogmatic dissensions between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arius</span>,<br/>
who filled the office of presbyter, and Athanasius, who afterwards<br/>
became a bishop, at length broke out, and were fraught with disastrous consequences. Alexandria was also soon obliged to yield to<br/>
Constantinople its proud position as the centre of Greek thought<br/>
and science. The sanguinary quarrels between the Athanasian<br/>
party and the Arians under their unworthy bishop <span style="color: #ff0000;">Georgius </span>further<br/>
contributed to the rapid decline of the city. On the accession of<br/>
Julian to the purple the pagans of Alexandria again instituted a<br/>
persecution of the Christians, and Georgius became one of their<br/>
victims. In the reign of Theodosius, however, paganism received its<br/>
deathblow, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theophilus</span>, the patriarch of Alexandria, displayed<br/>
the utmost zeal in destroying the heathen temples and monuments.<br/>
The famous statue of Serapis was broken in pieces and burned in<br/>
the amphitheatre amidst shouts of derision from a Christian crowd.<br/>
The material prosperity of the city also fell off so greatly, that the<br/>
municipality was no longer able to defray the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>of cleansing the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile </span>and keeping the canals open. After the death <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Theophilus<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">113</span>) the revenues <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>were still farther diminished by<br/>
the proceedings of the new patriarch Cyril, who led the armed mob<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">against </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">synagogues </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>expelled the Jews from the city; and<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">7115 </span>the learned and beautiful heathen <span style="color: #ff0000;">llypatia</span>, daughter of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mathematician'l'ln-on</span>, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">cruelly </span>murdered by an infuriated crowd.<br/>
<br/>
The reigns <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Marcia</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Leo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and Justinian were also <span style="color: #ff0000;">signalised<br/>
</span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">revolts</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">occasioned </span>by religious dissensions. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Under<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Justinian </span>all the still existing heathen <span style="color: #0000FF;">schools </span>were finally closed<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
