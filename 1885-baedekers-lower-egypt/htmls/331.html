<br/>
A peculiarity of many of the books recently printed at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bfilak </span>is that<br/>
smaller works illustrative of the text are printed on the margins of the<br/>
pages. The paper used for the purpose is made in Egyptian manufactories, chiefly from maize-straw, which accounts for its yellowish tint.<br/>
<br/>
The great attraction at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bridal</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>is the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Museum </span>of Egyptian Antiquities (the traveller bound for<br/>
which has only to direct his donkey-boy'lil <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antikét</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>collection, and entirely unrivalled of its kind. A great advantage possessed by it over all the European museums is that the<br/>
places where all its monuments and <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>have been found are<br/>
known, and indicated by labels, a circumstance of the greatest importance in assisting historical and geographical research. The collection was founded by M. Mariette-Pasha, who died in 1881 and<br/>
has been succeeded as director by Prof. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jfaspero</span>, another Frenchman. The keeper of the museum is Herr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch-Bey</span>, who is assisted by M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bowiunt</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The arrangement of the museum has recently been entirely<br/>
altered, and most of the treasures formerly stored in the magazines<br/>
have <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>found a place in the building itself. Several of the rooms<br/>
have been enlarged and an addition has been built to receive the<br/>
objects found at Dér el-Bahri, near Thebes, in 1881. Prof. Maspero<br/>
has also caused a room to be fitted up for monuments of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek</span>,<br/>
Roman, and Coptic periods.<br/>
<br/>
The Museum is open daily, except on Fridays, <span style="color: #0000FF;">horn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>to 12 and<br/>
from 2 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">5</span>; in winter from 8 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>to 4 o'clock (no fee).<br/>
Strangers, who wish to make special studies, will receive every<br/>
facility from the director and keepers.<br/>
<br/>
Court. To the right of the gateway is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>figure of King<br/>
Usertesen <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">LPl</span>. A), in rose-coloured granite, brought from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos<br/>
</span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1881</span>. Farther on, placed against the external wall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Museum</span>, are four dark-grey granite figures, in a sitting posture<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>of<br/>

an <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ethiopian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">queen</span>.<br/>
<br/>
This group, which is of rough workmanship, was found in 1882 at<br/>
Naga (Meme) <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Herr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berghoff</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, who some months later was captured and<br/>
beheaded by the Mahdi.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left side of the court are two large fragments of a granite<br/>
Naos, or shrine, with elaborate decorations and the name of King<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span>. In the corner to the left, <span style="color: #0000FF;">6002</span>. Large eagle in<br/>
marble, from the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theme</span>. To the left of the entrance to<br/>
the garden is a large Sphinx (No. 6008) in rose-coloured granite,<br/>
from Tanis in Lower Egypt; the cartouches of Ramses II. are a<br/>
later addition. To the right is a cast of the same figure (Pl. B).<br/>
<br/>
We now enter the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Garden </span>To the right: 6013, <span style="color: #ff0000;">6014</span>. Sarcophagi in grey granite from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkara</span>, belonging to <span style="color: #ff0000;">too </span>brothers named<br/>
