<span style="color: #0000FF;">History</span>. The (<span style="color: #0000FF;">msis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nf </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>was probably occupied at a very early<br/>
period by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amalekites</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and outside of its gates was doubtless fought<br/>
the battle in which they were defeated by the Israelites. The town of<br/>
the Oasis is even called by <span style="color: #ff0000;">hlahrizi </span>a city <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Amalekites, long after<br/>
the Christians had been expelled from it <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the Muslims. The Oasis is<br/>
mentioned by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span>only before the Christian period. but in the 2nd<br/>
cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ad</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Claudius <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaeus </span>speaks of the town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mere </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»</span>, which<br/>
soon became an Episcopal See and the central point of the monastic and<br/>
anchorite fraternities of the peninsula. Remains of old monasteries and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hermits</span>' cells are nowhere more numerous than here, and on the rocky<br/>
slopes and <span style="color: #0000FF;">plateau</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbfil</span>. In the 4th cent. we hear of the town<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span>governed by a senate<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and about the year 400 the spiritual affairs<br/>
of the country were presided over by Bishop <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nateras </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nathyr</span>. The<br/>
council of Chalcedon accorded to the oasis an archbishop of its own<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>who, however, was subordinate to the recently founded patriarchate of<br/>
Jerusalem. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">454 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Macarins </span>is mentioned as bishop of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharan</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">solitary </span>monasteries among the mountains suffered frequently from the<br/>
attacks of the Blemmyes and Saracens, who, however, did not venture<br/>
to attack the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-guarded </span>city of the oasis, which paid tribute to their<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">shekhe</span>. The Romans were nominally masters of <span style="color: #0000FF;">l'haran</span>, but in reality<br/>
it was subject to the sway of the Saracen princes<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and one of these, named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abokharagor</span>, presented it to Justinian, who<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>as a reward, appointed<br/>
him <span style="color: #0000FF;">phylarch </span>of the Saracens of Palestine. Early in the 5th cent. the<br/>
monks and <span style="color: #0000FF;">anchorites </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharan </span>began to embrace heretical principles,<br/>
and we <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hear </span>of admonitions and threats directed by the orthodox <span style="color: #0000FF;">synods </span>and the Emperors against them <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Monothelites </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monophysites </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>According to the trustworthy testimony of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Procnpius</span>, his<br/>
contemporary Justinian (527-505) was not the founder of the present <span style="color: #ff0000;">mnnastery </span>of Sinai, as inscriptions of the 13th cent. built into its walls<br/>
erroneously state, but <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>erected a church to the Virgin halfway up the<br/>
Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mime</span>, probably on the site of the present chapel of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Elijah</span>, and<br/>
also constructed and garrisoned a <span style="color: #0000FF;">strong </span>fortress at the foot of the<br/>
mountain, on the site <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the present monastery of St. Catharine, in order<br/>
to prevent the Saracens of the peninsula from invading Palestine. It<br/>
was doubtless the protection afforded by this castle that gradually attracted<br/>
the numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">hermits </span>of the peninsula from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbzil </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Miisa</span>, which they made the scene of a number of old Christian legends.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharan </span>was at an early period regarded as the site of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llephidim </span>of<br/>
the Bible (see below). Eusebius of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cmsarea </span>(h. 270), and his translator<br/>
Jerome, state that the battle of the Amalekites took place near <span style="color: #0000FF;">l'haran</span>.<br/>
Cosmas (535), who visited the Oasis in person, states that Rephidim, where<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Noses </span>struck the rock, lay near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharan</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">account </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Antoninus<br/>
</span>Martyr of his entry into <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharan </span>shows that regularly organised pilgrimages<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">llephidim </span>took place. Among other objects the natives <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>small<br/>
casks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">radish-oil </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Rhaphanino </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oleo</span>) to the pilgrims, which were probably carried <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>as mementoes of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bephidim</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>as its name (raphanus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">raphaninus</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">imports</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>After the dissemination of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam </span>the anchorites<br/>
gradually became extinct.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilephidim </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Bible <span style="color: #0000FF;">Narrative </span>(comp. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">493</span>). In the Book of<br/>
Numbers (xxxiii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1341</span>) we find the following passage<span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span>'And they <span style="color: #0000FF;">departed </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dophkah</span>, and encamped in Alush. And they removed from<br/>
Alush, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamped </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rephidim</span>, where was no water for the people to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">drink't </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Alush was probably situated between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Magnum </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1Triidi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ftrriiu</span>, and Rephidim in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Vadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fir-fin </span>at the entrance of the<br/>
oasis. The 17th chapter of the Book of Exodus contains important additional information. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>are there informed that the people murmured<br/>
against Moses, and reproached him with having led them out of Egypt<br/>
to die of thirst; <span style="color: #0000FF;">whereupon'Noses </span>cried unto the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lord</span>', who commanded<br/>
him to strike the rock with his staff. And <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muses </span>did so, and the rock<br/>
yielded a copious spring. Amalek then came and fought with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isra.e </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">~<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ites </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rephidim</span>, and the battle is described. The Bible narrative<br/>
presents <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>us a picture of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muses </span>stationed on a rock which commanded<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">battlefield</span>, and praying, while Aaron and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilur </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">stayed </span>up his hands<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
