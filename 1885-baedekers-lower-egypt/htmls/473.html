</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>arriving at the busy station<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the traveller is beset by a number<br/>

are very disreputable-looking. Ladies should not walk in the streets of<br/>
Suez after dark.<br/>

Disposition of Time. If the weather is calm, the harbour and entrance to the canal may be visited by small boat. Calm <span style="color: #0000FF;">weather </span>is also<br/>
very desirable for the excursion by land to the Springs of Moses (p. 419),<br/>
as the driving sand is excessively disagreeable in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>high wind. The<br/>
beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">clearness </span>of the green water, with its curious <span style="color: #0000FF;">shone </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">seaweed</span>, and the almost invariable beauty of the sunsets render a boating<br/>
excursion here unusually attractive. The situation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandbanks </span>and<br/>
of the navigable channel is of course best inspected at low tide.<br/>
<br/>
A charge of <span style="color: #ff0000;">B-Ss</span>. is usually made for <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>rowing-boat <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>half-a-day.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">boatmen </span>are apt to be extortionate in their demands, as travellers<br/>
on their way to <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Indis</span>, and making a short stay only, are often<br/>
too lavish in their payments. In fine weather a day may be pleasantly<br/>
spent as follows. Row early in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">morning </span>down the gulf to the<br/>
mouth of the canal, ascend the canal for a short distance, and land<br/>
at the usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">starting-point </span>for the Springs of Moses. Donkey (which<br/>
is brought in the boat from Suez) <span style="color: #0000FF;">5-6 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>for the day. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>now traverse<br/>
the desert, which extends down to the sea-shore, <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the (2 hrs.) Springs,<br/>
where luncheon (brought from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues</span>) may be taken. An hour <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>more<br/>
may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>spent here in resting or looking for shells on the shore, after<br/>
which we regain the boat in 2 hrs. more. We next row (again taking<br/>
the donkey with <span style="color: #0000FF;">as</span>) to the quays, land there, and dismiss the boat. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Remounting </span>the donkey, we ascend to the docks, inspect them at our<br/>
leisure, and then return to the hotel. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>excursion may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">accomplished </span>without much fatigue in about <span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span>hrs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>If the wind is favourable, the traveller may sail as far as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>caravan <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place<br/>
</span>(comp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nap</span>, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1114</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, whence the Springs are reached in half-an-hour<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but<br/>
the charge for the boat is then higher, and if the wind is favourable in<br/>
one direction, it is adverse in the other, so that nothing is to be gained<br/>
by this arrangement, unless donkeys are altogether dispensed with. In<br/>
stormy weather the pier and <span style="color: #0000FF;">docks </span>only can be visited with comfort.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The'Ar-ip </span>MOUNTAINS (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">418</span>) may be ascended on the S.W side,<br/>
but not without great difficulty, as the rocks are <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>and precipitous,<br/>
and competent guides are not procurable. The view, according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frees</span>,<br/>
is most beautiful and interesting, as the whole of the isthmus and the<br/>
canal lie at the spectator<span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>feet like a vast map.<br/>

the numerous natural products of the Red Sea, which is of a tropical<br/>
