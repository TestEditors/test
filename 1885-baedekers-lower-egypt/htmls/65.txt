<span>Copts. THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. 43<br/>
<br/>
another world, and weary of their motley and confused Pantheon<br/>
of divinities, whose self-seeking priesthood designedly disguised<br/>
the truth, they eagerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">welcomed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>simple doctrines of Christianity,<br/>
which appeared so well adapted to their condition and promised<br/>
them <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sut'eour </span>and redemption. Like <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eutyches</span>, they revered the<br/>
divine nature of the Saviour only, in which they held that every<br/>
human element was absorbed<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and when the Council of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chalcedon<br/>
</span>in 451 sanctioned the doctrine that Christ combined a human with<br/>
a divine nature, the Egyptians, with their characteristic tenacity<br/>
adhered to their old views, and formed a sect termed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Entychians</span>, or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Monophysites</span>, to which the Copts of the present day still belong.<br/>
<br/>
The name of the Copts is an ethnical <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span>, being simply an Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">cur </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ruption </span>of the Greek name of Egyptians. The theory is <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>exploded that<br/>
they derive their name from a certain itinerant preacher named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jacobus</span>,<br/>
who according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahrizi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>termed <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Beriidin</span>, or'blanket-bearer', from<br/>
the old horse-cloth worn by him when he went <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>preaching. This<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Jacobus </span>promulgated the monophysite doctrine of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eutyches</span>, which had<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">found </span>its most zealous supporter in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dioscurus</span>, a bishop of Alexandria,<br/>
who was declared <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>heretic and banished after the Council of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chalcedon</span>;<br/>
and his disciples were sometimes called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jacolvites</span>. If this name had ever<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>abbreviated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Habit </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cobt</span>, it would probably have occurred<br/>
frequently in the writings of Monophysites; but there we find no trace<br/>
of it. It is, on the other hand, quite intelligible that the word Copt,<br/>
though originally synonymous with Egyptian<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>should gradually have come<br/>
to denote a particular religious <span style="color: #0000FF;">sent</span>; for, at the period when the valley<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tras </span>conquered <span style="color: #0000FF;">by'Amr</span>, the native Egyptians<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>who almost<br/>
exclusively held the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monophysite </span>creed, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>distinguished by<br/>
their religion from their invaders, who brought <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>new religious system<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the East.<br/>
<br/>
These Egyptian Christians strenuously <span style="color: #0000FF;">opposed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">resolutions </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the Council of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chalcedon</span>. and thousands of them <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificed </span>their<br/>
lives or their welfare in the fierce and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sauguiuary </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">conflicts </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gth </span>century, the causes of which were imperfectly understood by<br/>
the great majority of the belligerents. The subtle dogmatic differences which gave rise to these wars aroused such hatred among<br/>
these professors of the religion of love, that the defeated Monophysites readily welcomed the invading armies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Tshirts</span>, or perhaps<br/>
even invited them to their country.<br/>
<br/>
After the conquest of Egypt by'Amr the Copts were at first<br/>
treated with lenity, and were even appointed to the highest government <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>; but they were soon doomed to suffer persecutions and<br/>
privations of every description. These persecutions were mainly<br/>
due to their unbounded arrogance and their perpetual conspiracies<br/>
against their new masters, and their Mohammedan contemporaries<br/>
even attributed to them the disastrous conflagrations from which the<br/>
new capital of the country so frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffered </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">242</span>). Accustomed for many ages to regard themselves as the most civilised of<br/>
nations, and the Greeks as their inferiors, they perhaps imagined,<br/>
that, if they succeeded in throwing off the yoke of the barbarous<br/>
children of the desert, they could prevent the revival of the hated<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">iyzantiue </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">supremacy</span>. Their hopes, however, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">damned </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">bitter<br/>
