In order to remove the bodies of the dead from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the<br/>
inundation of the Nile, they were buried in the dry rocky soil of<br/>
the desert. Wealthy persons caused tomb-chambers <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>. 379) to be<br/>
excavated for themselves, while the kings, who wished to maintain<br/>
their royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">pre-eminence </span>even in death, were specially anxious to<br/>
ensure the durability and permanence of their tombs. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">burialplace </span>of a king was worthy, in their opinion, of being distinguished<br/>
by its situation and its magnitude; they desired that it should surpass all others in magnificence, and that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber </span>should<br/>
be least capable of violation<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>It was probably, therefore, at first<br/>
customary to cover the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-tomb </span>of a king with blocks of stone, or<br/>
to raise a mound over it, if sand and earth were procurable in the<br/>
vicinity. The violent winds from the desert, however, rendered it<br/>
necessary to consolidate these mounds by covering them with stones.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchral </span>mounds thus acquired a definite form; they became<br/>
square structures, tapering upwards, and gradually assumed the<br/>
pyramidal shape, ensuring the utmost strength and durability.<br/>
Opening of the Pyramids. The Pyramids are said first to have<br/>
been opened by the Persians (<span style="color: #0000FF;">BU</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">525-333 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, and it is certain that<br/>
they were examined by the Romans. The Arabs <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to<br/>
penetrate into the interior of these stupendous structures, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>in hope of finding treasures; and the greater the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties </span>they<br/>
encountered, the more precious and worthy of concealment did<br/>
they imagine the contents to be. According to'Abdellatif, it<br/>
was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalif </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mamfin </span>(A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">813-33</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harun </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-liashid<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">101 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, who caused the Great Pyramid to be opened; but it is<br/>
probable that that prince merely continued the investigations ofhis<br/>
predecessors, as Dionysius, the Jacobite patriarch of Antioch, who<br/>
accompanied him, found that an entrance had <span style="color: #ff0000;">alreadyheen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">effectedt<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1lirnCm</span>'s workmen are said to have made a new entrance (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">357 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]<br/>
</span>adjacent to the old, with the aid of fire, vinegar, and projectiles.<br/>
With regard to the success of the undertaking there exist various<br/>
more or less highly embellished accounts by the Arabian historians;<br/>
but one thing appears certain, that the hopes of the explorers were<br/>
disappointed, and that nothing was found in the already plundered<br/>
chambers and corridors. According to some accounts, the gold found<br/>
here was exactly enough to defray the cost of the undertaking,<br/>
having possibly been introduced into the interior by the Khalif<br/>
himself, in order to obviate the reproach of having spent so much<br/>
money for nothing. Many of the Arabs relate, that, after the<br/>
workmen had penetrated to a considerable depth, they found a<br/>
vessel containing a considerable sum of gold coin, amounting,<br/>
strangely enough, to the exact sum which had been spent on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>investigation. Along with the treasure was found a marble slab,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">hearing </span>an old inscription <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>that the money beside it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">summed </span>to pay for the work of the inquisitive king; but that, if he<br/>
attempted to penetrate farther, he would expend a large sum and<br/>
