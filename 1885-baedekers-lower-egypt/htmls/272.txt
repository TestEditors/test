to connect the Nile with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sea</span>. The city was considerably extended in the reign of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">splendour-loving </span>Ahmed ibn <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tulan</span>, the founder<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the dynasty of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulunides</span>, who erected the new quarter of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ElKhutiya</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">resent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">citadel</span>. Among the buildings ascribed<br/>
to him is the mosque (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">205</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span>which still bears his name. The town of<br/>
was favoured by his successors also, and particularly by his son<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">yeh</span>, who erected <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>palace here; and at length, under the<br/>

the old. The new city was founded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaime</span>, the general of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mite<br/>

as barracks for the soldiers commanded by him. At the hour when the<br/>
foundation of the walls was laid, the planet Mars, which the Arabs call<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lfahir</span>, or'the <span style="color: #0000FF;">victorious</span>', crossed the meridian of the new city; and<br/>

name of Egypt or of its capital, seems also already to have been applied<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fos.tii.t</span>, which, to distinguish it from <span style="color: #ff0000;">lllasr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Kfihira</span>, was now called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">May </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'Ati</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>(the present Old <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cairo </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. The new town extended rapidly.<br/>
Bricks were easily made of the Nile mud, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nohattam </span>hills <span style="color: #ff0000;">atrorded<br/>
</span>excellent stone, while the gigantic ruins of the ancient Memphis on<br/>
the opposite bank of the river were also used as a quarry, as the<br/>
foundations of the houses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mill </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">show </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">973 </span>the new city of Cairo was<br/>
constituted the capital of Egypt, and for many centuries after that period<br/>
the destinies of the country were determined here. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">1100 </span>the citadel<br/>
which still <span style="color: #0000FF;">commend</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the city was erected by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saliheddin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Saladiul </span>on the<br/>
slope of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lllolgattam </span>hills<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the same sultan caused the whole town,<br/>
together with the citadel itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>to be enclosed by a wall, 29,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ens </span>in<br/>
length. Under his luxurious and extravagant successors Cairo was greatly<br/>
extended and <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificently </span>embellished. According to the Arabian <span style="color: #0000FF;">historians</span>, the most enterprising of these sultans was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nohammed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">en-Ntlsjir<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>1341), who constructed numerous handsome edifices both within and<br/>
without the citadel, as well as canals and roads, thus converting the ruins<br/>
and sand-hills in the environs into beautiful <span style="color: #ff0000;">suburbs</span>, with palaces and<br/>
pleasure-grounds. At that period, however, Cairo was fearfully devastated<br/>
by the plague, as it had been on two former occasions <span style="color: #0000FF;">fin </span>1067 and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1295</span>),<br/>
and was also several times subsequently<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and, according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahrizi</span>, no<br/>
fewer than 900,0000) persons died in <span style="color: #0000FF;">old </span>and New Cairo between November, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1348</span>, and January, 1319. The town suffered severely in other ways<br/>
also, and indeed its whole history, so far as <span style="color: #ff0000;">recOrded</span>, like that of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sultans </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes </span>themselves, seems to have presented an<br/>
almost continuous <span style="color: #ff0000;">sn6cessiou </span>of revolutions, rapine, and bloodshed<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>As<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">most </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>Sultans who resided in the citadel <span style="color: #0000FF;">diet</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>a violent<br/>
death, so the reign of almost every new <span style="color: #0000FF;">potentate </span>began with bitter and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sanguinary </span>contests among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entire </span>for the office <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>vizier, while but<br/>
few reigns were undisturbed by insurrections in the capital. During the<br/>
third regime of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammad </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nasir</span>, who had <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>twice deposed, and<br/>
as often recovered his throne<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>persecution of the Christians <span style="color: #ff0000;">look </span>place<br/>
at Cairo. The Christians, of whom great numbers resided in Cairo and<br/>
throughout the whole of Egypt, were accused by the people of <span style="color: #ff0000;">incenIliarislu</span>. Their churches were accordingly closed or demolished, while<br/>
they themselves were so <span style="color: #ff0000;">ill </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Â» </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">treated </span>and oppressed, especially in the reign<br/>
of Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sale </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>(1351-51), that many of them are said to have <span style="color: #ff0000;">embraced<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lslamisin</span>. In 1366 and 1367, in the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Snltfm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sha'bcin</span>, sanguinary<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">conflicts </span>took place in the streets of Cairo between hostile parties of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, and in 1377 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sha'ba</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'m </span>himself was tortured and strangled in<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eitudil</span>. Even greater disorders attended the dethronement of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultan<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.1350</span>), when the wildest anarchy prevailed at Cairo, the convicts<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">escaped </span>from their prisons, and in concert with the populace plundered<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">houses </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">emirs </span>and the public magazines. The following year<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">rebellion </span>again <span style="color: #0000FF;">broke </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, who stormed the<br/>
citadel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Consequence </span>of which <span style="color: #ff0000;">llarkfik </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">regained </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">possession </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">throne</span>, and celebrated his <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumphal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">entry </span>into Cairn. Searcely, however<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
