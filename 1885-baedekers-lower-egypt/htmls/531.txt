and none of those small relics of the period of the Pharaohs, which are<br/>
usually found so abundantly among the ruins of Egypt, have been discovered here. This was perhaps the site of the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dionytiat</span>, a town<br/>
which probably sprang up on the ruins of a Roman military station,<br/>
situated on the extreme western side of Egypt. On the outskirts of the<br/>
ruins are walls which perhaps belonged to gardens; there must also have<br/>
been once an aqueduct for the purpose of supplying the inhabitants and<br/>
their gardens with water<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>

situated opposite to the point at which we approach the lake from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fjenhrhr</span>. The scanty ruins on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>bank of the lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">CEI-pantmama</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, are not worthy of a visit; but the ruins <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dimeh</span>, although no inscriptions have been found there, present some attraction. A street, 400 yds. in length, formerly embellished with figures<br/>
of lions, leads to a platform on which an important temple once<br/>
stood. The numerous blocks scattered about here, resembling millstones, and apparently <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span>rounded, are discovered on closer<br/>
inspection to be of natural formation. The paved court was surrounded by a brick wall, and the temple itself contained several<br/>
apartments; a peristyle, with columns now in ruins, led to the entrance. Notwithstanding the imperfect state of the ruins, they<br/>
suffice to prove, that a town of very considerable importance, perhaps the ancient Bacchis, once stood here.<br/>

The PYRAMID AND <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mnsranas </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Manon</span>, the oldest monuments in the<br/>
world, deserve a visit, which if the traveller approaches by the river, may<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>accomplished from the village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tt </span>in about <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>hrs. (railway travellers may perform it in about the same time from the el-Wasta station;<br/>

</span>11/4 hr. <span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span>the pyramid, which rises close to the cultivated country on the<br/>
soil of the desert, 11/2 <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span>N. <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>of the village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">11151111 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>. This appears<br/>

on the mastabas of the early period of Snefru.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Médum </span>is so <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>from all the other structures <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the kind that it is called by the Arabs'El-Haram <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Kaddtib</span>', or'the false<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pyramid</span>'. From a large heap of rubbish which covers its base, the<br/>
smooth and steep upper part of the structure rises in three different<br/>
stages at an angle of 74°10, and is still preserved to a height of 122 ft.<br/>
The first section is 69 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>, and the second 201/2 ft., while the third, now<br/>
almost entirely destroyed, was once <span style="color: #0000FF;">32 </span>ft. in height. The outer walls consist of admirably jointed and polished blocks <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Molgattam </span>stone<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
holes in one of the surfaces were made by Lepsius and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Erhkam </span>when<br/>
they examined the pyramid, the construction of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">afforded </span>them an<br/>
admirable clue to the principle upon which the others were built (<span style="color: #0000FF;">camp</span>.<br/>
p. 350). The Pyramid of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Médum </span>was never completed<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the heap of debris<br/>
at its base consists of the material which once filled the angles of the<br/>
different sections, so as to give the pyramid a smooth surface. The pyramid was pillaged as early as in the time of the 20th Dynasty. It was<br/>
opened in 1881 by Maspero, who found <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">long </span>corridor and a chamber<br/>
without sarcophagus<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Perhaps in this pyramid <span style="color: #0000FF;">Snefru</span>, the first king of the<br/>
4th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pym</span>, was buried, as in the neighbouring tombs persons related to him<br/>
are interred.<br/>
<br/>
The Mastabas of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Méddm</span>, which were opened by Mariette, lie to the<br/>
N. of the pyramid. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Those </span>were the tombs of the relations of Snefru<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">4th </span>Dyn.), and in many respects resemble the mausolea of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salglgdrah </span>which<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">bear </span>the same name. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">facades </span>of the most important of them are<br/>
