<br/>
the late summer or early autumn of the European year. The land<br/>
is extremely fertile, but it is not so incapable of exhaustion as it is<br/>
sometimes represented to be. Many of the crops, as elsewhere, must<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>be followed by a fallow period; others thrive only when<br/>
a certain rotation is observed (such as wheat, followed by clover and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">beans</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>; and some <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>require to be artificially manured. Occasionally two crops are yielded by the same field in the same season<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>wheat and <span style="color: #ff0000;">saffron</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">wheat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span>clover, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. The recent great<br/>
extension of the cultivation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-cane</span>, which requires a<br/>
great deal of moisture, and of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plant</span>, which requires<br/>
extremely little, has necessitated considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">modifications </span>in the<br/>
modes of irrigation and cultivation hitherto in use. As both of these<br/>
crops are of a very exhausting character, the land must either be<br/>
more frequently left fallow<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>or must <span style="color: #0000FF;">be</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span>manured. The<br/>
industry and powers of endurance of the Egyptian peasantry are<br/>
thus most severely tried, and no imported agricultural labourers<br/>
could ever hope to compete with them, as has sometimes been<br/>
thought possible. Although the homogeneous soil of the valley of<br/>
the Nile breaks up <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofits </span>own accord after its irrigation, and requires<br/>
less careful <span style="color: #0000FF;">tilling </span>and ploughing than ours, it <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">warts </span>more uniform attention throughout the whole year, while its irrigation<br/>
involves a great additional amount of labour to which the European<br/>
farmer is quite unaccustomed. The increasing use of artificial<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">manures7 </span>which were formerly but little known, is another source<br/>
of great labour. As the country is thickly peopled and supports<br/>
numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">cattle</span>, there ought to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>no lack of natural manure; but,<br/>
as the dung of the domestic animals is used as fuel throughout<br/>
Egypt, where wood is very scarce, that of pigeons (p. 79<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>is almost<br/>
the only kind available for agricultural purposes. An abundant<br/>
source of manure is afforded by the ruins of ancient towns, which<br/>
were once built <span style="color: #ff0000;">ot'unbaked </span>clay, but now consist of mounds of earth,<br/>
recognisable only as masses of ruins by the fragments of pottery they<br/>
contain. Out of these mounds, which conceal the rubbish of thousands of years, is dug a kind of earth sometimes containing as much<br/>
as <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">?</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>per cent of saltpetre, soda, ammonia, and other <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salts</span>. This<br/>
manure possesses extremely fertilising properties, but <span style="color: #ff0000;">ifused </span>at the<br/>
wrong time or place is very injurious to the soil.<br/>
