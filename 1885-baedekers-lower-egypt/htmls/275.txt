<span>Street Scenes. CAIRO. 3. Route. 245<br/>
<br/>
tion, in which all nations, customs, and epochs are represented,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>a living museum of all imaginable and unimaginable phases<br/>
of existence, of refinement and degeneracy, of civilisation and<br/>
barbarism, of knowledge <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ignorance</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">paganism</span>, Christianity,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedanism</span>. In the Boulevards of Paris and on London<br/>
Bridge I saw but the shadow, and at Alexandria the prelude only,<br/>
of the Babel of Cairo, to which the Roman or the Venetian carnival<br/>
is tame and commonplace. These marvellous scenes cannot fail to<br/>
strike every one, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">particularly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>uninitiated <span style="color: #0000FF;">new-comer</span>, most<br/>
forcibly. In order to enjoy them thoroughly, one cannot help<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">wishing </span>for eyes behind, as well as before, and for the steady power<br/>
of forcing one's way possessed by the camel of burden'. (B. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goltz</span>.)<br/>
There is, however, no great difficulty in forcing one's way through<br/>
the crowd in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Muski</span>, although the chaotic, <span style="color: #0000FF;">carnival-like </span>scene<br/>
which it presents can hardly be depicted in too bright colours.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the streets in the old part of the town are still unpaved and inaccessible to carriages, and they are too often<br/>
excessively dirty. The Khedive, however, is annually increasing<br/>
the number of carriage-ways by the demolition of old streets and<br/>
the erection of buildings in the modern style. The lanes separating the rows of houses in the Arabian quarter are so narrow that<br/>
there is hardly room for two riders to pass, and the projecting<br/>
balconies <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>harems with their gratings often nearly meet. The<br/>
new quarter on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>side of the city possesses broad, shadeless<br/>
streets, handsome avenues, and the beautiful <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezbekiyeb </span>Garden<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>258); but Oriental life seems to find this atmosphere <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncongenial</span>, and it must therefore be sought <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the old quarters, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">particularly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the Muski, the chief business thoroughfare. The busy<br/>
traffic in this street often presents an'interminable, ravelled, and<br/>
twisted string of men, women, and animals, of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Walkers</span>, riders, and<br/>
carriages of every description. Add to this the cracking of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">drivers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>whips, the jingling of money at the table of the changers<br/>
established at every corner of the street, the rattling of the brazen<br/>
vessels of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-carriers</span>, the moaning of the camels, braying<br/>
of donkeys, and barking of dogs, and you have a perfect pandemonium'. Europeans, and even ladies, may ride with perfect safety<br/>
through the midst of all this confusion, and they will often have<br/>
opportunities of observing most picturesque and amusing scenes.<br/>
The denseness of the crowd sometimes seems to preclude the possibility of farther progress, but the hammer, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-hoy</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
<br/>
</span>pretty sure to elbow a passage without much difficulty.<br/>
<br/>

satisfaction <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>child which utters articulate expressions for the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">time<br/>
</span>and when I was instantly so perfectly understood by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey<br/>
</span>boys that they all offered me their donkeys at once (though perhaps<br/>
they would have done so had <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>not spoken at <span style="color: #0000FF;">all</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">felt </span>like a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magician<br/>
