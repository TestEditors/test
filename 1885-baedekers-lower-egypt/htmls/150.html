according to the well known myth, awakes to new life after <span style="color: #0000FF;">being<br/>
</span>burned, and brings its <span style="color: #0000FF;">ashes </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis </span>once every five hundred<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lIarmachis</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the great<br/>
god<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>years, was also associated with the worship<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>. As Apis is associated with Ptah, so<br/>
this bird by the side of Ra is a symbol of<br/>
the soul of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra </span>is generally represented with the head of a hawk, and coloured red. He holds in his hands the <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbols </span>of life and sovereignty, and wears on<br/>
his head a disk with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Urmis </span>serpent, or<br/>
basilisk. According to the esoteric <span style="color: #ff0000;">andpantheistic </span>construction of the inscriptions on<br/>
the tombs of the kings, Ra is the great Universe (<span style="color: #ff0000;">:6</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>raw), and the gods themselves are<br/>
merely so many impersonations of his<br/>
various attributes (see Ammon Ra, p. 138).<br/>
<br/>
Tum, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alum</span>. a manifestation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>,<br/>
whose name is perhaps akin to <span style="color: #0000FF;">temi</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">signifying </span>the universe, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>worshipped in<br/>
Lower Egypt, particularly at Heliopolis and<br/>
at the city of Pa-tum, that is,'the place of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tum</span>', the Pithom of Scripture. His rites<br/>
were also celebrated in Upper Egypt at an<br/>
early period. He is one of the oldest of the<br/>
gods, having existed'on the waters' in the<br/>
dark chaos of the embryonic world, prior to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>sunrise, or birth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis </span>from<br/>
the lotus flower. According to the later exoteric views he was the setting sun, the<br/>
harbinger of the coolness of evening. Under<br/>
his guidance mankind was created by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnum</span>, and he was the dispenser of the<br/>
welcome northerly breezes. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>was also the<br/>
approved warrior against the dark powers<br/>
of the infernal regions which obstruct the<br/>
progress of the sun's bark, and is represented as a bearded man with a combined<br/>
Upper and Lower Egyptian crown, or the<br/>
orb of the sun, on his head, and the emblems<br/>
of sovereignty and life in his hands. As the<br/>
creator he sometimes has a <span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabaaus </span>for<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ahead</span>; as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nefer-Tum </span>he has the head of<br/>
a lion, surmounted by a hawk crowned with<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lotus </span>flowers, and holds an ut'a eye<br/>
<br/>
Tum of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">10</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>in his hand. As representing the setting of<br/>
<br/>
of the world<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>the sun preparatory to its rising again, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
