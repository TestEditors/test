Gebel Maryam, which an Arabian legend points out as the place<br/>
where Miriam, when smitten with leprosy for her disapproval of the<br/>
marriage of Moses with an Ethiopian woman, spent seven days,<br/>
beyond the precincts of the camp of the Israelites (Numbers, <span style="color: #ff0000;">xii </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>.<br/>
<br/>
At the 80th <span style="color: #0000FF;">kilometre </span>stone the Canal enters Lake Timsah, or<br/>
the Crocodile Lake (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">4091</span>, on the N. bank of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>lies the town<br/>
of Isma'iliya. The lake, which is now about 6 sq. M. in area, and<br/>
of a beautiful pale blue colour, was, before the construction of the<br/>
Canal, a mere pond of brackish water, and full of reeds. On 18th<br/>
Nov. 1862 the water of the Mediterranean was let into this basin,<br/>
which is traversed by two <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>channels for the passage of<br/>
large vessels.<br/>

While the Canal was being constructed this town was the central point of the works, and the residence <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofnumerous </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">officials </span>and<br/>
traders, so that its <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">soon </span>became very considerable, and it<br/>
has even been extolled by modern poets as a'wonder of the desert'.<br/>
Its suddenly acquired prosperity declined almost as suddenly when<br/>
the canal works were completed, but the town has lately regained<br/>
a little of its former animation. The houses and gardens and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroyal </span>chateau, which had fallen into a dilapidated condition,<br/>
have recently been restored. The climate is pleasant and the air<br/>
dry, notwithstanding the proximity of the water. The ground,<br/>
which has been reclaimed from the desert by means of irrigation,<br/>
has been planted with tasteful gardens. On the N.E. side of the<br/>
town are the chateau of the Khedive and the waterworks; <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span>side is the Arabian quarter.<br/>
<br/>
The best way of spending a <span style="color: #0000FF;">few </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">leisure </span>hours here is to visit the<br/>
hill of El-Gisr (see below; <span style="color: #0000FF;">1-2 </span>hrs.; donkey <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fix</span>). The route to it<br/>
passes the Pierre Gardens and the engine-house of the waterworks.<br/>

Canal, which now intersects the plateau of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Gisr </span>('the threshold')<br/>
in a straight direction. The hills of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tll-Gisr </span>cross the course of the<br/>
Canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little to the N. <span style="color: #ff0000;">nfLake </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Timsilh </span>and presented a serious <span style="color: #0000FF;">ole<br/>

</span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">59 </span>ft. above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-level</span>, and it is now about <span style="color: #ff0000;">82ft</span>. above the<br/>
bottom of the Canal. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>order to form a cutting through it, no less<br/>
than 18,707,000 cubic yds. of earth had to be removed, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">20,000<br/>
