<span>THE NILE. 59<br/>
<br/>
although its fall from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assnfin </span>(by the first cataract) to Cairo is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">299 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>only, or about seven inches per mile. The rapidity of the<br/>
stream, however, which averages <span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">miles </span>an hour, is not so serious<br/>
an impediment to the navigation as the frequent changes which<br/>
take place in the formation of its channel, sometimes <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasioning<br/>
</span>difficulties which the most careful of captains is unable to foresee.<br/>
<br/>
If we now enquire what influence this remarkable river has<br/>
exercised on the history of civilisation, we can hardly avoid the<br/>
conclusion that it was the Nile, with its unique character, that<br/>
stimulated the ancient Egyptians to those great physical and <span style="color: #0000FF;">intellectual </span>exertions which rendered them the most famous and the<br/>
most civilised among the nations of antiquity. The necessity of<br/>
controlling its course and utilising its water taught them the art of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">river-engineering </span>and the kindred <span style="color: #0000FF;">science </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">land</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">surveying</span>, while<br/>
in the starry heavens they beheld the eternal calendar which regulated the approach and the departure of the inundation, so that the<br/>
river may perhaps have given the first impulse to the study of<br/>
astronomy. As the annual <span style="color: #0000FF;">overflow </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the water obliterated all landmarks, it was necessary annually to measure the land anew, and to<br/>
keep a register of the area belonging to each proprietor; and above<br/>
all it became an important duty of the rulers of the people to impress them with a strong sense of the sacredness of property. Every<br/>
succeeding year, however, there arose new disputes, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">these<br/>
</span>showed the necessity of establishing settled laws and enforcing<br/>
judicial decisions. The Nile thus led to the foundation of social,<br/>
legal, and political order, and it is also natural that the mighty and<br/>
mysterious river on which the welfare of the entire population <span style="color: #0000FF;">depended </span>should have awakened their religious sentiment at a very<br/>
early period. Subsequently, when the engineers and architects, in<br/>
the service of the state or in the cause of religion, erected those<br/>
colossal structures with which we are about to become acquainted,<br/>
it was the Nile which materially facilitated the transport of their<br/>
materials, and enabled the builders of the pyramids and the other<br/>
ancient Egyptians to employ the granite <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofAssu√©n </span>for the structures<br/>
of Memphis, and even for those of Tanis, on the coast of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mediterranean </span>As the river, moreover, not only afforded a convenient<br/>
route for the transport of these building materials, but also an admirable commercial highway, we find that the Egyptians had acquired<br/>
considerable skill at a very early period in constructing vessels<br/>
with oars, masts, sails, and even cabins and other appliances.<br/>
<br/>
From the earliest historical period down to the present time the<br/>
course of the Nile, from the cataracts down to its bifurcation to the north<br/>

This, however, is not the case with its <span style="color: #ff0000;">FIMB0UciiU1tEsifor</span>, while ancient writers mention seven (the Pelusiac, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanitic</span>, the Mendesian, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Buculic </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Phatnitic</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sebennytic</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bolhitinie</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Carwpic0</span>, there are now practically two channels only<br/>
through which the river is discharged into the sea. These are the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">months </span>at Rosetta (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dumyfit</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, situated <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
