<span>448 Route 8. ROSETTA. Towns <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
</span>to the Greek tradition <span style="color: #ff0000;">thatrthat </span>pilot was interred here. Strabo describes<br/>
the pleasure-loving town as <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-'Canobus </span>is a city which lies 120<br/>
stadia from Alexandria, if one goes by land, and is named after the<br/>
helmsman of Menelaus who died there. It contains the highly revered<br/>
temple of Serapis, which, moreover, works such miracles that even the<br/>
most respectable men believe in them, and either sleep in it themselves,<br/>
or get others to sleep there for them. Some persons also record the<br/>
cures, and others the <span style="color: #0000FF;">streets </span>of the oracle dreams experienced there. A<br/>
particularly remarkable thing is the great number of parties of pleasure<br/>
descending the canal from Alexandria; for day and night the canal<br/>
swarms with men and women, who perform music on the flute and<br/>
licentious dances in the boats with unbridled merriment, or who, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cano..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bus </span>itself, frequent taverns situated on the canal and suited for such<br/>
amusements and revelry<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>The jars known <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'canopi</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>301) derive<br/>
their name from this place.<br/>
<br/>
On the shore of the semicircular bay of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abulgir </span>are several small<br/>
forts, and on the promontory rises <span style="color: #ff0000;">alighthouse</span>. The train continues<br/>
to traverse the narrow neck of land between the Lake of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahuhir<br/>
</span>and Lake Edku beyond it, on the right, and the Mediterranean on<br/>
the left. Stations (<span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>M.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Et-Illa'adiyeh</span>, near the former <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canopic<br/>
</span>mouth of the Nile (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">25 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MO </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Edku</span>, a village situated on<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand-hill </span>to the right. The train finally traverses a dreary expanse<br/>
of sand, and reaches Rosetta (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">440</span>).<br/>
<br/>
FROM <span style="color: #0000FF;">DAMANHI'JR </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T0 </span>ROSETTA. We ride past several wells and<br/>
along the bank of a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>traverse some fields, leave the<br/>
ruins of <span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">film </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ez-Zargan </span>to the right, and in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span>hr. reach the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Muhmfidiych </span>Canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">223</span>), which lies between lofty banks, and<br/>
is traversed by barges and small steamers plying between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosetta</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aftera </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ride </span>of about 10 min. more, we observe,<br/>
on the opposite bank of the canal, a long, desolate-looking, <span style="color: #ff0000;">onestoricd </span>house, which was used for the accommodation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">workman </span>employed in cleaning the canal in the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id </span>Pasha.<br/>
The canal, which connects Alexandria with Cairo and the Delta,<br/>
and at the same time supplies the former city with water from the<br/>
Nile (see p. 215), was constructed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammad'Ali </span>in 1819 at a<br/>
cost <span style="color: #ff0000;">of71/2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">millionfraucs</span>. In the execution ofthe <span style="color: #ff0000;">workhe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">employed<br/>
</span>the forced labour of <span style="color: #ff0000;">r250,000 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fellahin</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span>no fewer than 20,000<br/>
are said to have perished from disease and over-exertion. We follow the bank of the canal, and about <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">/2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span>from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fumm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Alahmfidiyeh </span>reach two rows of remarkably <span style="color: #ff0000;">line </span>trees, under the<br/>
shade of which we continue our route. Near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fumm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elAUalynthltyeh</span>,<br/>
where the canal receives its supply of water from the Rosetta arm<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bile</span>, its banks are lined with solid brick masonry, and at<br/>
this point we observe a number of barges awaiting the opening of<br/>
the lock-gates which separate the canal from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">river</span>. The engines<br/>
by means of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">impetus </span>is given to the water so as to cause it<br/>
to flow towards Alexandria are four in number, each being of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">100 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">horse </span>power. The large and handsome engine-rooms may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he<br/>
</span>visited by the traveller. Adjacent is a workshop for repairs.<br/>

The <span style="color: #ff0000;">hanksofthellosetta </span>arm are monotonous, but are enlivened<br/>
by a considerable number of towns. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>place on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right<br/>
