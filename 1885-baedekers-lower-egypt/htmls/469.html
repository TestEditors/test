Another scene of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">forced </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Israelitish </span>labour was Ramses, which has<br/>
been identified by Lepsius with the ruins of Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">e1~Maskhfita </span>(see<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">below</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>others suppose it to have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanis-Zoz'in</span>,<br/>
the modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">San </span>(see remark, p. 452). The environs of these towns were<br/>
richly cultivated, while another part of Goshen was, as at the present<br/>
day, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>sterile character, and probably suitable for pasturage at certain<br/>
seasons only. In this E. province of the empire the Egyptian element<br/>
of the population preponderated in the towns only. On the coast were<br/>
settled Phoenician colonists, and the desert tracts bounding and extending into the cultivated land were occupied by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bednins</span>, living in tents,<br/>
as at the present day; while the marshes in the region around <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lake </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Meir<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">zaleh </span>were peopled by cowherds, as to whose Semitic origin the <span style="color: #ff0000;">monuments </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">afiord </span>conclusive evidence. The higher culture of the Egyptians<br/>
would doubtless in many cases influence and attract these <span style="color: #0000FF;">strange</span>, but<br/>
the constant influx of immigrants from the vast neighbouring <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">c<br/>
</span>countries of Asia would on the other hand seriously impede the progress<br/>
of civilisation in this part of the empire. Down to the present day the<br/>
character of the population of the N. and E. parts of the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Goshen<br/>
</span>has remained nearly the same as in ancient times. The European merchants represent the <span style="color: #ff0000;">aneient </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">thnicians</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduius </span>who haunt the<br/>
sterile regions are the wandering Semites of antiquity, and the peculiar<br/>
inhabitants of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menzaleh </span>region (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">452</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>are similar to the primitive<br/>
pastoral <span style="color: #0000FF;">population</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond <span style="color: #0000FF;">C50 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M.</span>) stat. Aha Hammad, on the left, begins the<br/>
Arabian desert, which is here an undulating sandy plain with<br/>
scanty desert vegetation. It is intersected in an easterly direction<br/>
by the fertile <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wtali </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tt2mililt </span>and the fresh-water canal, which present a striking contrast to their surroundings. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right, beyond<br/>
the canal, stretches a beautiful green tract of <span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>beyond<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">rise </span>the hills of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
66 M. Stat. Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">cl-chtr</span>, an insignificant <span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>which lately<br/>
attained celebrity as the scene of Arabi's defeat by the British<br/>
troops in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1882</span>. It lays claim to the honour <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofoccupying </span>the site of<br/>
the Pithom of the Bible; but that city must have <span style="color: #0000FF;">Min </span>more to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">S</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W.</span>, on the site of the present Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ald </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">8uttmtm </span>(see above).<br/>
On leaving Tell el-Kebir the train passes a cemetery laid out by the<br/>
English, with a tasteful monument to the British soldiers who fell<br/>
in the struggle with Arabi. A little farther on a tower and a palace<br/>
come in <span style="color: #0000FF;">eight<br/>
<br/>
</span>80 M. Stat. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahsameh </span>possesses the remains of a monument<br/>
which probably belonged to one of the cities of Ramses where <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>

the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sethroitic </span>Nome<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusiac </span>and Tanitic arms of the Nile.<br/>
This district, according to the inscriptions, also bore the Semitic name<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suki'6t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'tents</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, which it doubtless derived from the nomadic <span style="color: #0000FF;">life </span>led<br/>
by its Semitic shepherd inhabitants, who from a very early period had<br/>
been permitted by the Pharaohs to pasture their <span style="color: #ff0000;">tlocks </span>there. Classic<br/>
authors state that Heracleopolis Parva (see pp. 87, <span style="color: #0000FF;">453</span>) was the capital<br/>
of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">name</span>, while the monuments mention <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi-torn </span>as its capital. The<br/>
identification of the site of Pithom is farther facilitated by the fact<br/>
that the ancient itineraries place it on the route from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium </span>to<br/>
Tanis (p. 452), exactly halfway between these places. The surrounding<br/>
country was covered with lakes and marshes, and was intersected by<br/>
canals in every direction. At the present day the district is half desert<br/>
and half swamp, and it is traversed by the canal between Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">sh'id </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.thd<br/>
