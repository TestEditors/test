<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">506 </span>Route 10. MONASTERY OF SINAI. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>occupied by the monks, pilgrims, and travellers, are situated on<br/>
the first floor of the houses, which are only one room in depth, their<br/>
doors being connected by a long, wooden gallery. The whitewashed walls bear numerous Greek inscriptions, some of which<br/>
were written by a monk of Athos, named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cyril</span>, who was formerly<br/>
librarian here. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">ditterent </span>buildings are separated by small<br/>
courts; one <span style="color: #ff0000;">oi </span>these contains a well, and a small group of apricot<br/>
trees enclosed by stakes. The low buildings are commanded by a<br/>
lofty cypress. From the embrasures in the walls and ramparts a<br/>
few small cannons still frown on the now <span style="color: #0000FF;">peaceful'Saracens</span>'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>the midst of the buildings is situated the church (see <span style="color: #0000FF;">below</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, with<br/>
its handsome tower, adjoining which is the ill-preserved mosque.<br/>
The wells yield excellent water, particularly one in a shed at the<br/>
back of the church, which the monks point out as the one at which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Moses </span>watered the flocks of Jethro's daughters.<br/>
<br/>
The Church of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Transfiguration </span>is an early Christian basilica.<br/>
The exterior is uninteresting<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the centre of the W. side, which<br/>
forms a kind of facade, a large cross, with a window in the centre,<br/>
takes the place of the usual rose-window; and on each side of it<br/>
is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-tree </span>engraved on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- The church is entered by<br/>
a porch, and a flight of steps descending beyond it, both of which<br/>
have been restored. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the middle of each of the topmost steps<br/>
is aletter of the name of St. James (<span style="color: #0000FF;">y-A-K-Q-B-O-S</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- We first<br/>
enter a vestibule (narthex) with a Byzantine window, containing<br/>
a large, modern basin for holy water with small silver eagles.<br/>
The framework of the door leading into the nave is richly decorated<br/>
and the panels are embellished with old pictures in enamel, of<br/>
small size. The basilica, which we next enter, notwithstanding<br/>
the lowness of its aisles, and the superabundant decoration peculiar<br/>
to Greek churches, is not devoid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. Each of the lofty walls<br/>
hearing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entablature </span>of the nave rests on thick columns of<br/>
granite, covered with stucco and painted green, the capitals of<br/>
which are adorned with boldly executed foliage. The ceiling has<br/>
been recently <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-painted</span>, and divided into bright coloured sections containing indifferent medallion figures of John the Baptist,<br/>
the Virgin and Child, and the Saviour.<br/>
<br/>
The Aisles are lighted by five Byzantine windows on each side,<br/>
and are covered by a sloping roof. A coloured Marble <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pavement </span>in<br/>
the nave now replaces one of admirable mosaic which was destroyed by Arabian treasure-seekers. Adjoining the third column<br/>
on the left side of the nave is a marble Pulpit adorned with pleasing miniatures, which was presented to the church in 1787. Near<br/>
the fourth column on the right is the Episcopal Throne, dating from<br/>
the last century, and interesting on account of a representation of<br/>
the monastery at that period, painted by an Armenian artist, and<br/>
held by figures of Moses and <span style="color: #0000FF;">St. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Catherine </span>The inscription repeats the date <span style="color: #0000FF;">527 </span>which is erroneously stated by the monks <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
<br/>
