<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">llere</span>, between two <span style="color: #0000FF;">causeways</span>, each 20 ft. in width, he found a deep band<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>soil. on which probably <span style="color: #ff0000;">grow </span>a row of trees; and this street was also<br/>
provided with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">water</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">conduit</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Side-streets</span>, which were 23 ft. in<br/>
width only, <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>generally about 300 <span style="color: #0000FF;">yds </span>apart.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tit </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">PRIKCIPAL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BUILDINGS </span>of ancient Alexandria the relics are now<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>scanty that it is impossible to determine the character of the edifices<br/>
to which they belonged. (With regard to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>Cleopatra's Needle<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pompey</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>Pillar, <span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>pp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">213</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">2212</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>) The locality least free from doubt<br/>
is the site of the Paneum, which according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo </span>(ib., <span style="color: #ff0000;">§ </span>10) was'an<br/>
artificial circular mound, resembling a rocky hill, to which <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>winding<br/>
way ascends. From its summit one can survey the whole of the surrounding town in every <span style="color: #0000FF;">direction</span>'. This spot is doubtless identical with<br/>
the modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">KGm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cd-Dik</span>, the highest ground in the town, 112 ft. in height,<br/>
where the reservoir of the waterworks (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>216) is now situated.<br/>
<br/>
The Gymnasium, according to Prof. Kiepert, who has minutely examined<br/>
the plans of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mabmfid-Bey</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and not the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seine </span>and Museum, occupied the<br/>
site of the old German consulate and its garden.'The most beautiful<br/>
building<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>however,' says <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ib.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">§8</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the Gymnasium, with its<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">colonnadcs</span>, which are more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stadium </span>in length. In the middle lie<br/>
the courts of justice and groves'.<br/>
<br/>
The theatre, the Sema or Soma, and the Museum were situated<br/>
in the quarter of the Royal Palaces (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>209), and <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupied'a </span>fourth or even a third part of the<br/>
whole extent of the city' <span style="color: #0000FF;">0b.</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">§ </span>8). This quarter must have lain to the<br/>
N. of the great street leading to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canopic </span>Gate, and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lochias</span>, and must have adjoined the harbour <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lay </span>beyond it'.<br/>
The Alexandrian Theatre lay opposite the island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antirrhodus </span>(p. 209),<br/>
in accordance with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">custom </span>that obtained at Greek seaports of placing<br/>
theatres where they <span style="color: #0000FF;">could </span>command a view of the sea. Speaking<br/>
of the Sema, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Strabn </span>(ib., <span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>8) describes it <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'another </span>part of the royal<br/>
buildings, an enclosed space, within which are the tombs of the kings<br/>
and that of Alexander. For Ptolemy Lagi had taken away the body of<br/>
the latter from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pcrdiccas</span>, who had brought it from Babylon. Now<br/>
Ptolemy brought the body of Alexander to Alexandria and buried it where<br/>
it now lies, though not in the same coffin. The present coffin is of <span style="color: #ff0000;">hyalus<br/>
</span>(glass or alabaster), but the former was of gold, which was <span style="color: #ff0000;">earried<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">air </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptr0emy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">surnanied </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Parisactus</span>, son of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cocccs</span>' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Xl</span>. Alexander <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>- A sarcophagus carried off by the French, and<br/>
afterwards captured by the English and deposited in the British Museum,<br/>
was once supposed to be that of Alexander, but, when the hieroglyphics<br/>
upon it were deciphered, they were found to have no reference to him.<br/>
<br/>
The Museum, like the Sema, belonged to the quarter of the royal<br/>
palaces, and probably stood on the spot where some huge ruins, since<br/>
described by Brugsch, were discovered in 1853 when a Greek school was<br/>
being built. These ruins lay on the S. side of the Place <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mébémct-Ali </span>and<br/>
m the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>of Cleopatra's Needle, a site which would correspond with the<br/>
quarter of the palaces. The library undoubtedly was connected with the<br/>
Museum, and it is noteworthy that among these ruins a hollowed stone<br/>
was found bearing the inscription,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Dioskorides</span>, 3 <span style="color: #0000FF;">vols </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>, though it can<br/>
hardly have been used as a receptacle for scrolls. From these walls, now<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">buried </span>beneath the earth, once flowed a copious stream of knowledge,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefits </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>which continue to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>traceable even at the present day.<br/>
According to <span style="color: #0000FF;">mini </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tih</span>, §8), the Museum <span style="color: #ff0000;">contained'3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ball </span>for walking,<br/>
another <span style="color: #0000FF;">tor </span>sitting<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and a large building with the dining-room <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">scholars </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">residing </span>at the Museum. The society also possesses revenues in<br/>
common, and the Museum is presided over by a priest, formerly appointed<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>kings. but now by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cmperor</span>'. <span style="color: #ff0000;">This'ball </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">walking</span>' was an<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">extensive </span>court shaded with trees and provided with fountains and <span style="color: #0000FF;">benches</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the hall for sitting was used for purposes of business and study.<br/>
The latter was a <span style="color: #ff0000;">covrred </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">colunnnde</span>, closed on one side, where the scholars<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">assunbbd</span>, and where their pupils, <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirsting </span>for knowledge, listened to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">im-t-q-Is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ut</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">masters </span>Like all the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">dining-halls</span>, that of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">linsruul </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span>had a flat roof, a polished pavement, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">balustrade<br/>
