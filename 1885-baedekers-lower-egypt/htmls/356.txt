</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fumrn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Khalig</span>, or influx of the city canal into an arm of the<br/>
Nile, which, however, is dry from May until the period <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">overflow</span>. The festivities connected with the cutting of the Nile embankment take place here in August. The straw-market is bounded<br/>
on the S. by the Old Aqueduct of the Citadel, which has been disused since the completion of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">steam-pump </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1872</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Head of this conduit, separated by a street from the arm of the<br/>
Nile just named<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>is constructed of solid masonry in a hexagonal form,<br/>
and consists of three stories, about 150 ft. in diameter. The ground-floor<br/>
contains stables and magazines, and on the first and second is <span style="color: #0000FF;">accommodation </span>for about 130 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soldiers</span>. () n the terrace, where there are six waterwheels <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sitlgiyehsh </span>each <span style="color: #0000FF;">worked </span>by two oxen, is a large hexagonal basin<br/>
from which <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>water flowed into the aqueduct. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the platform <span style="color: #0000FF;">there </span>are<br/>
also stables <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the oxen and chambers for the attendants. The aqueduct,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">constructed </span>of massive blocks of stone, and resting <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>pointed arches, ascends in four <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>levels to the citadel, the total height being <span style="color: #0000FF;">27811.</span>,<br/>
and the total length <span style="color: #ff0000;">110003115</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">21/4 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">AL</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. When <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile was at its lowest,<br/>
the water had <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>raised <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>a height of 80 ft. to the first basin. A<br/>
branch of this conduit supplied the Jewish quarter with water in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">neighbourhood </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">lmftm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shafc'i </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>327). The aqueduct dates from the<br/>
time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Saladin </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">12th </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cent</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1262</span>). The entrance is in the N. wall, at the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of the head of the aqueduct, where a Berber is posted as a custodian<br/>
(fee <span style="color: #ff0000;">1/1 </span>fr. for each person)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Views from the openings of the platform,<br/>
very <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine</span>. Easy ascent by an inclined plane.<br/>
<br/>
Towards the left, a few hundred yards from the gate of the head<br/>
of the aqueduct are situated the Christian Cemeteries, surrounded<br/>
by lofty walls. The first is the English Cemetery, the second the<br/>
Roman Catholic, beyond which are those of the Greeks, Armenians,<br/>
and Copts, which present no attraction.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the head of the aqueduct, we follow the direction of<br/>
the arm of the Nile, which, however, is not always visible, as the<br/>
houses and walls of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manjul </span>quarter interpose between the<br/>
road and the water, and reach (<span style="color: #0000FF;">11 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MO </span>the mansion which formerly belonged to <span style="color: #0000FF;">s'lenu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sas </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pasha </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-FransthoiCColonel </span>Selves), with<br/>
two fine Arabian portals (visitors not <span style="color: #0000FF;">admitted</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. The second narrow and short road to the right beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cltfrteau </span>leads to the<br/>
ferry crossing to the Island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Roda</span>. We descend the slope, enter<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ferry-boat </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">1,41</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">%</span>. for one person, there and back; for a party<br/>
more in proportion; payment made on returning), ascend the opposite path, and turn to the right. A young gardener is usually<br/>
in waiting at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place </span>to conduct travellers <span style="color: #0000FF;">through </span>the<br/>
intricate lanes to the garden. At the S. extremity of the island<br/>
is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nilgmelcr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fNiliyriti</span>), situated on land belonging to the heirs<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>lawn Pasha. The garden, laid out in the Arabian style, is miserably neglected. The paths are paved with a kind of mosaic of<br/>
round pebbles, obtained partly from the desert, and partly from<br/>
the island of Rhodes, and the most important of them are <span style="color: #0000FF;">bordered </span>with low walls, supporting wooden verandahs and <span style="color: #ff0000;">arhours</span>,<br/>
over which climb immense vines. The gardens contain orange<br/>
and lemon trees, dates, palms, and bananas, and also the henna<br/>
plant, which is not met with in the public gardens of Cairo<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
