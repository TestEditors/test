<br/>
Higher up (comp. Plan, p. 396) we observe scenes representing<br/>
the snaring of birds and the catching of fish in nets and baskets;<br/>
and we here read the last of the hieroglyphic <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'Let<br/>

<br/>
</span>what is in it fall down', and'the emptying of the receptacle formed of rushes'.<br/>
<br/>
To the right, towards the door, is a large and striking tableau,<br/>
representing <span style="color: #ff0000;">*hTi </span>engaged in hippopotamus hunting. He stands in<br/>
a light papyrus boat, leaning on a staff, and is more than double<br/>
the size of his attendants. The hunting of crocodiles and hippopotami on the Nile formed a favourite pastime of the wealthy<br/>
Egyptians, and we find scenes of this kind recurring frequently,<br/>
especially in the burial chapels of the earliest period of the Egyptian monarchy. The bearing of Ti is calm and dignified, while<br/>
the captain of the vessel,'the chief over the people of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">birdpond </span>Atet', seems to be attending to the directions of his master<br/>
with a view to communicate them to the crew. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the foremost<br/>
vessel three of the men are engaged in securing two aquatic monsters <span style="color: #0000FF;">floundering </span>in the water, one of which has been caught with<br/>
a kind of snare and is threatened with the spears of the hunters.<br/>
An allusion to this kind of hunting is said to be contained in the<br/>
following passage in the Book of Job <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cxli</span>. 1,2) <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'Canst </span>thou draw<br/>
out leviathan with an hook? or his tongue with a cord which thou<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lettest </span>down? Canst thou put an hook into his nose? or bore his jaw<br/>
through with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">thorn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">v.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The other hippopotamus which the men<br/>
are <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavouring </span>to secure has a small crocodile in its <span style="color: #ff0000;">month</span>. At<br/>
the stern of Ti's vessel is a smaller boat containing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">boy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>who is<br/>
about to strike on the head <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">silurus </span>which he has caught. The<br/>
other fish represented in the water are so faithfully drawn that the<br/>
species to which they belong are easily determined. The three <span style="color: #0000FF;">boots<br/>
</span>are surrounded by papyrus plants, among the tops of which various<br/>
birds are sitting on their nests or fluttering about. A pair of kingfishers with their young, in a nest faithfully copied from nature<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
