ing Syria and even Egypt itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>was still treated by his emirs as a<br/>
youth under age, and the real rulers of the country were <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seller</span>, his<br/>
chancellor<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">BÃ©bars </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ll</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jasbengir</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prefect </span>of his palace, who had<br/>
originally been a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Circassian </span>slave. In 1309 <span style="color: #0000FF;">N'its.sir </span>returned to Kerak, for<br/>
the avowed purpose of undertaking a pilgrimage to Mecca, but on his<br/>
arrival there he announced his intention to throw <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the trammels of<br/>
tutelage, and for a time to establish his residence at Kerak. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">consequence </span>was that he was declared at <span style="color: #0000FF;">C. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>to have forfeited his<br/>
throne, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Behars </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span>was proclaimed sultan in his stead (April, 1309).<br/>
The Syrian emirs, however, remained faithful to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nfisir</span>, and with their<br/>
aid he succeeded in re-establishing his authority in Egypt, although the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">nominal </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rAhhasiile </span>Khalif residing at <span style="color: #0000FF;">01-11111 </span>had pronounced him an<br/>
outlaw and declared war against him. The three chief traits in <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ir's<br/>
</span>character. distrust, vindictiveness, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupidity</span>, now became very<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">prominent</span>, and there was no promise or oath which he deemed <span style="color: #ff0000;">inviolablc</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">llc </span>treated his emirs with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">utmost</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">capriciousness</span>. presenting them<br/>
with rich gifts, or ordering them to be executed, as the humour seized<br/>
him; and this feature of his character has been aptly described by<br/>
an Arabian historian, who declares'that he fattened his emirs, and killed<br/>
them when thoroughly fattened, in order that all they had swallowed<br/>
might return to him.' <span style="color: #0000FF;">15111.111 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abul </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fidi </span>(p. 201), however, one of his<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">einirs</span>, retained his master's <span style="color: #0000FF;">111111111- </span>till the <span style="color: #0000FF;">time </span>of his death, and even<br/>
had the title of sultan conferred upon him. Towards the mass of the<br/>
population, on the other hand, <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span>was always liberal and condescending; he abolished oppressive taxes, punished <span style="color: #0000FF;">hoarders </span>of grain, and<br/>
distributed corn in times of famine. He was tolerant towards the<br/>
Christians <span style="color: #0000FF;">also</span>, and was anxious to abrogate the regulations about <span style="color: #0000FF;">111 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2731 </span>which certain fanatics had induced him to make in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">earlie</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>years, but was unable to carry out his wish. He even appointed Christian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, particularly in <span style="color: #0000FF;">thc </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">custom-house </span>and finance departments. His<br/>
chief object was to surround himself with officers who could procure <span style="color: #0000FF;">him<br/>
</span>money, to defray the enormous expenses of his court, to gratify his taste<br/>
for horses (of which no fewer than 3000 are said to have been reared in<br/>
his stables annually), and his love of building. He connected Alexandria<br/>
anew with the Nile by means of a navigable canal, and constructed other<br/>
canals also, such as that from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khiinlyth </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">b'ir'has</span>, and embankments.<br/>
In spite of his tyranny, he therefore enjoyed a considerable share of<br/>
popularity, to which his stringent enforcement <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the religious laws and<br/>
his indulgence towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">clergy </span>so long as they did not interfere in<br/>
politics, farther contributed. On 0th Jan. 1311 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nisir </span>died <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>death <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>a pious and penitent Muslim. As <span style="color: #ff0000;">soon </span>as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">emit-s </span>perceived that his<br/>
end was near, they seized upon the whole of his property, so that after<br/>
his death not even a suitable <span style="color: #0000FF;">pall </span>to cover the corpse could be found.<br/>
His miserable funeral took place by night, attended by a few emirs only,<br/>
and lighted by a single lantern. Thus, according to his Arabian biographers,<br/>
terminated the reign of the powerful sultan whose dominions had extended<br/>
from the frontier of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abyssinia </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>Asia Minor, and from the Euphrates to<br/>
Tunis<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>but who, <span style="color: #0000FF;">though </span>wealthy and the father of twelve <span style="color: #0000FF;">sons</span>, died like<br/>
a stranger and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>childless man. and was buried like a pauper.<br/>

The <span style="color: #0000FF;">late</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Romanesque </span>portal, in marble<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>with its round<br/>
arch<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>is strikingly different from all other Arabian portals of the<br/>
kind. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>was originally <span style="color: #0000FF;">cream </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>at Acre in Syria, after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">destruction </span>of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>was transferred to Cairo in A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1291 </span>by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mamehike </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Saltin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Ashraf </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">955</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>as a trophy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">victory</span>. The only object of interest in the interior is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">well1leihted </span>and beautifully moulded Arabian <span style="color: #0000FF;">stucco-work</span>, remains of<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>preserved.<br/>
