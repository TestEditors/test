<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Faydm </span>a peculiar kind of water-wheel is in use, so contrived as to<br/>
be turned by the weight of the water.) According to Figari-lley,<br/>
the number <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sakiyehs </span>used in Central and Lower Egypt in 1864<br/>
was about 50,000, which were turned and superintended by 200,000<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>and 100,000 persons, and which irrigated <span style="color: #0000FF;">1500,000 </span>acres of<br/>
land. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">The'SlIIMIU</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, an apparatus resembling that of an ordinary<br/>
well, set in motion by one person only, and drawing the water in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">buckets </span>resembling baskets in appearance<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>as a substitute for the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sakiyeh </span>several <span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>are sometimes arranged one above the other.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">til</span>) When it is possible to store the water in reservoirs above the<br/>
level of the land to be watered, it is allowed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">overflow </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields<br/>
</span>whenever required. This is the only method available in the oases,<br/>
where fortunately the water rises from the springs with such force<br/>
as to admit of its being easily dammed up at a sufficiently high<br/>
level<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">4</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>Pumps driven by steam are also used, particularly when<br/>
a large supply of water is required, as in the ease <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sugarplantations </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Clefs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>of the Nile in Northern Egypt, where they<br/>
are seen in great numbers. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">5</span>) Lastly <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'U'Mdt</span>', a peculiar, very<br/>
light, and easily moved wooden wheel, which raises the water by<br/>
means of numerous fans. is used in the Lower Delta only and in<br/>
places where the level of the water in the canals remains nearly<br/>
the same. In order to distribute the water equally over <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>fields,<br/>
they are sometimes divided into a number of small squares by means<br/>
of embankments of earth, 1 ft. in height, which, owing to the great<br/>
plasticity of the Nile mud, are easily opened or closed so as to<br/>
regulate the height of the water within them<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jlefore </span>describing the different Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">agricultural </span>seasons,<br/>
we must first observe that they are no longer so sharply defined as<br/>
they probably were in ancient times. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Besides </span>the old crops, there<br/>
are now several others of recent introduction, and so extensively<br/>
grown as in some measure to <span style="color: #ff0000;">revolutionise </span>the modes of cultivation.<br/>
These are maize, rice, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-cane</span>, cotton, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ramieh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and indigo.<br/>
(This last plant was known to Pliny, but it was probably grown in<br/>
his time only to a very limited <span style="color: #0000FF;">extent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>The agrarian measures <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the Egyptian government are all directed towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">emancipation<br/>
</span>of farming from its dependence upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inundations</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in order that<br/>

best. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankments </span>and various apparatus for the regulation<br/>
of the water supply<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>recently constructed or founded by the government, vie in importance with the greatest ancient works <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>kind.<br/>
