relation to human affairs. He is the'destroyer of enemies<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, he aids<br/>
mankind in the battle of life, and he heals the sick. To his head<br/>
the moon is attached by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">infantine </span>lock. From his wanderings as<br/>
the god of the moon, and from the vigour with which he destroyed<br/>
evil spirits, he was identified with Heracles by the Greeks.<br/>
<br/>
Doctrine of Immortality. From the account of the worship of<br/>
Isis and Osiris it is obvious that the Egyptians believed in the immortality of the soul <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>whence arose the prevalent worship of<br/>
ancestors ], in amoral responsibility, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">future </span>state <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofrcwards<br/>
</span>and punishments. The doctrine with regard to the life of the soul<br/>
after death was not, however, at all times and in all places the<br/>
same. According to the Egyptian belief, every human being consisted of three distinct parts, which during the period of life were<br/>
closely united: (1) the body, a portion of matter; <span style="color: #0000FF;">C</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">?</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the'shi</span>,<br/>
or soul, which belonged to the nether world and ultimately returned thither; and (3) <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Ichu</span>', an emanation of the divine<br/>
intelligence. Each of these elements could be separated from<br/>
the others, but whatever changes it underwent, it was immutable<br/>
in quantity and quality. As the god of the sun is always the<br/>
same and yet hourly different, being at first Horus, then Ra, next<br/>
Tum, and finally Khnum, so it was with the soul and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">intelligence </span>which fills and illuminates it, and which, as soon as<br/>
the gates of the tomb are opened for its reception, speaks and acts<br/>
for it. Once within the gates of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenthes</span>, the soul had to undergo<br/>
many trials. Ferocious beasts had to be conquered, demons to be<br/>
subdued, and castles to be stormed, and all this was to be done<br/>
with the aid of texts and hymns written on papyrus and <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarabaei</span>,<br/>
ut'a eyes, and other amulets swathed in the bandage of the mummy.<br/>
At length the soul reached the hall of double justice, where the<br/>
heart in its vase <span style="color: #0000FF;">If</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>was placed in one scale and the goddess of<br/>
truth in the other. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cynocephalus </span>conducted the process<br/>
of weighing, Anubis superintended<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thoth </span>recorded the result, and<br/>
Osiris with <span style="color: #0000FF;">forty-two </span>counsellors pronounced sentence. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ifthe </span>heart<br/>
was found too light, the soul was condemned so suffer the <span style="color: #0000FF;">torments<br/>
</span>of hell, or to continue its existence in the bodies of animals, within<br/>
a certain period after which it returned to its original body to begin<br/>
life anew, and had afterwards to undergo another trial by the judges<br/>
of Hades. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lfthe </span>heart was found <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>heavy, Osiris restored<br/>
it to the soul; the'sahu' might then return to its mummy; its<br/>
intelligence, after a period of purification in the regions of the<br/>
blessed, might unite with the divinity from which it had emanated,<br/>
and, merged in Horus, Osiris, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>, might traverse the heavens in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">boat </span>of the sun, or walk anew among the living in any form it<br/>
pleased. Finally both <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'sahn</span>' and the intelligence were <span style="color: #0000FF;">reunited </span>to the dead body they had quitted, which its <span style="color: #0000FF;">mummification<br/>
</span>had preserved from decay, and which awaited the return <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>soul<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenthes </span>or from its sojourn in the bodies of animals<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
