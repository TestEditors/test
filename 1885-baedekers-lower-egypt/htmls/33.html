<span>DRAGOMANS. 13<br/>
<br/>
Travellers about to make a tour of any length may avoid all the<br/>
petty annoyances incident to direct dealings with the natives by<br/>
placing themselves under the care of a DRAGOMAN (Arab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">twgemdn</span>).<br/>
<br/>
The word dragoman is derived from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chairman </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">target </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»</span>,'to explain',<br/>
or from <span style="color: #ff0000;">lei-912m</span>,'explanation'. The Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">u-gam </span>also signifies'to interpret<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>. The dragoman was therefore originally merely a guide who explained or interpreted. Since the 7th cent<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">BA</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l'sammetiehus </span>I.<br/>
threw open the country to foreign trade, against <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>it had <span style="color: #0000FF;">previously<br/>
</span>been jealously closed, this class, which is mentioned by Herodotus as a<br/>
distinct caste, has existed in Egypt. That author informs us that<br/>
Psammetichus caused a number of Egyptian children to be educated by<br/>
Greeks in order that they might learn their language; and it was these<br/>
children <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>afterwards became the founders of the dragoman caste.<br/>
The great historian himself employed a dragoman, from whom he <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequently </span>derived erroneous information. A dragoman, who was employed<br/>
by the governor Elius <span style="color: #0000FF;">Genus </span>to accompany him up the Nile, is accused<br/>
by Strabo of absurdity, conceit, and ignorance. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ignorant </span>Arabian,<br/>
Nubian, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Maltese dragomans of the present day do not attempt to explain <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>translate the ancient inscriptions. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">effort </span>was recently made<br/>
with some success to educate young Arabs for this calling in a school<br/>
founded for the purpose; but, like most Oriental undertakings, the<br/>
scheme has not been persevered with.<br/>
<br/>
The dragomans, who speak English, French, and Italian,<br/>
undertake for a fixed sum per day to defray the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>cost of<br/>
locomotion, hotel accommodation, fees, and all other expenses, so<br/>
that the traveller is enabled to obtain, as it were, a bird's eye view<br/>
of the country without being concerned with the cares of daily life.<br/>
On the other hand the traveller is frequently imposed upon by<br/>
the dragoman himself.<br/>
<br/>
The charge made by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman </span>varies very greatly according<br/>
to circumstances, such as the number and the requirements of the<br/>
travellers, the length of the journey, and the amount of the demand<br/>
for the services of such a guide. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman </span>is usually employed<br/>
for the longer tours only, such as the voyage up the Nile, the journey<br/>
to Mt. Sinai, the excursion to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayurn</span>, and a visit to the less <span style="color: #0000FF;">frequented </span>towns in the Delta. Visitors to Alexandria, Cairo, Suez,<br/>
Isma'iliya, and Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id </span>may well <span style="color: #0000FF;">dispense </span>with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman</span>, as<br/>
every necessary service will be rendered them by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">commissionnaires </span>of the hotels (<span style="color: #0000FF;">5-10 </span>fr. per day). Dragomans of the better<br/>
class, moreover, usually consider it beneath their dignity to escort<br/>
their employers through the streets of the towns, and are apt to<br/>
consign them to the guidance of the local cicerones.<br/>
<br/>
For the above-named longer tours the charges vary so greatly,<br/>
and the services to be rendered on each are so different, that a<br/>
separate contract with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman </span>should be drawn up in each<br/>
case. (Thus, for the Nile voyage he has to procure a <span style="color: #0000FF;">dahabiyeh</span>,<br/>
for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayfim </span>horses, for Mt. Sinai camels, for the Delta canalboats and donkeys, and, for the last three journeys, tents also.)<br/>
Information regarding expenses and other details, as well as the<br/>
names of some of the best dragomans, will be prefixed to each of<br/>
the routes in question. The larger the party, the less will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
