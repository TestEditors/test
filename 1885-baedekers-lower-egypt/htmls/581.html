<span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sinah </span>JEBEL <span style="color: #0000FF;">MI'JSA</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>. Route. 511<br/>
<br/>
minutes more we reach a pleasant green plain, called the'plain of<br/>
the Cypress', after a gigantic cypress which rises in the middle of<br/>
it. It is enclosed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">hold </span>and barren masses of rock, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">reddishbrown </span>and grey pinnacles of hard granite. Exactly to the S. of<br/>
the cypress rises the peak of the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mtsa</span>; farther distant, to<br/>
the S.W., towers the lofty Jebel Katherin (p. 515), and to the<br/>
N. is the cliff of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Safszlf </span>rising from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Raha </span>plain. On a<br/>
plateau to the right of the path is a nursery of saplings by the side<br/>
of a fresh spring. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>turn to the left of the cypress, and mount<br/>
the rugged blocks over which lies the route to the summit of the<br/>
Jebel Musa. On a small eminence, which unites the cypress plain<br/>
with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Musa</span>, on the left of the path, is a simple white<br/>
stone building, containing two chapels dedicated to the prophets<br/>
Elijah and Elisha. The rudely-whitewashed interior contains a<br/>
hollow which the monks point out as the cavern in which Elijah<br/>
concealed himself after he had slain the priests of Baal on the brook<br/>
Kishon and had wandered 40 days and 40 nights in the wilderness.<br/>
Jehovah commanded him to ascend to the top of the mountain.<br/>
'And behold', we read in 1 Kings xix. <span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ser</span>,'the Lord passed<br/>
by, and a great and strong <span style="color: #0000FF;">wind </span>rent the mountains, and brake in pieces<br/>
the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind: and after<br/>
the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake: 12.<br/>
And after the earthquake <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fire, but the Lord was not in the fire: and<br/>
after the fire a still small voice. 13. And it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>so<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>when Elijah heard<br/>
it, that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">wrapped </span>his face in his mantle, and went out<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and stood in<br/>
the entering in of the cave. And, behold, there came a voice unto him,<br/>
and said<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">What </span>doest <span style="color: #0000FF;">then </span>here, Elijah?<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>We may remind the reader<br/>
how <span style="color: #0000FF;">effectively </span>Mendelssohn has set this sublime passage to music.<br/>
Beyond the Chapel of Elijah (<span style="color: #ff0000;">6900 </span>ft.) the route, or rather the<br/>
flight of steps <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>3000 in all, according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pococke</span>; 500 to the spring<br/>
of Sangarius, 1000 to the Chapel of Mary, 500 to the chapel of<br/>
Elijah, and 1000 to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">top</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>becomes steeper, but by daylight<br/>
it is nowhere attended with danger. The granite is at first<br/>
speckled red, afterwards grey, green, and yellow. After an ascent<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">40 </span>min. more, a natural hollow in the granite is pointed<br/>
out by the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>to the left of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">path</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot-print </span>of the<br/>
camel which the prophet rode on his visit to Sinai, before his<br/>
call. According to another legend, the camel is said to have<br/>
stood with one foot in Damascus, another in Cairo, the third in<br/>
Mecca, and the fourth on Mt. Sinai, where the impression is still to<br/>
be seen, and thence to have been carried up into heaven with his<br/>
rider by the angel Gabriel. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>hr. more we reach the summit<br/>
of the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mdsa </span>(7363 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, which rises 2350 ft. above the monastery. On the small <span style="color: #0000FF;">plateau </span>at the top, to the left, partly built<br/>
on ancient foundations, is situated a small and simple chapel,<br/>
which those of the guides who are monks enter with candles and<br/>
incense. On the right rises a small mosque in <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>preservation,<br/>
which the Arabs revere highly, and which, until recently, they<br/>
were only permitted to enter clothed in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ilmim</span>, or single, <span style="color: #0000FF;">plain<br/>
