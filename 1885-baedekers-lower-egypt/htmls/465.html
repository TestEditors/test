in the reign of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, the wealthy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhampsinitus </span>of Herodotus. The<br/>
pronomen and surname of the latter monarch (Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">hak </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>are of<br/>
frequent recurrence, and he was probably the founder of the ancient<br/>
sanctuary, of which but few traces now remain. Every vestige of that<br/>
edifice, as well as of the Jewish temple. which was built after <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>model<br/>
of the Temple of Solomon, and tended materially to widen the breach<br/>
between the Syrian and Egyptian Jews, had long been lost, when, in 1871,<br/>
Brugsch found under the rubbish here some massive substructions of<br/>
Oriental alabaster<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and a number of interesting mosaic tiles with which<br/>
the walls had once been overlaid<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and on which were not only rosettes<br/>
and decorative figures<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>but representations <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">battles </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>and<br/>
other scenes. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">wen </span>known Oriental type of <span style="color: #0000FF;">head </span>so characteristically drawn by the Egyptian artists, was found to recur very frequently.<br/>
Cartouches of Ramses 111. in <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">avenue </span>and his easily recognised portrait<br/>
in alabaster were also found at <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>places. The most valuable are<br/>
now in the museum of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ihilii </span>A walk to this spot is pleasant, and the<br/>
hills command a picturesque view, especially by evening light, but of the<br/>
ruins themselves there is very little <span style="color: #ff0000;">now </span>to be seen.<br/>
<br/>
Next stations <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">29 </span>M.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jnshtsy </span>and (<span style="color: #0000FF;">36 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MO </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Belbé</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span>, which is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">supposed </span>to be the ancient Pharbaethus. The town was formerly a<br/>
place of some importance from its situation at the junction of most<br/>
of the routes leading from Cairo to the East. The railway now approaches the Fresh-Water Canal, which was probably constructed<br/>
by the early Pharaohs, and certainly existed in the 14th cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">11.0.</span>,<br/>
but afterwards fell to decay and was not again utilised until <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>construction of the modern canal.<br/>
<br/>
Near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zakfizik </span>were the sources of those streams which intersected the<br/>
land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Crushes </span>rendering it famous <span style="color: #0000FF;">for-its </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">productiveness</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>they then fell<br/>
into the Bitter Lakes. which were connected with the Red Sea by means of<br/>
an artificial canal.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Now </span>another canal', says <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>,'falls into the Red<br/>
Sea and the Arabian Gulf near the town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arsinoe</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>. which some call<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kleopatris</span>. It also flows through the so-called Bitter Lakes, which were<br/>
formerly bitter. But when the canal was constructed they changed their<br/>
character through the blending of the waters. so that they are now well<br/>
stocked with fish and frequented by <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-fowl</span>'. The channel of the old<br/>
canal, which was <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-discovered </span>by the French expedition of 1798, is still<br/>
traceable at places, and its direction has frequently been followed by the<br/>
engineers <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>de Lesseps. From the not <span style="color: #0000FF;">inconsiderable </span>remains of the<br/>
old canal near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Belbés</span>, it appears to have been about <span style="color: #0000FF;">JO </span>yds. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">100 </span>ells,<br/>
according to Strabo) in width, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">16-17</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span>ft. in depth. The somewhat<br/>
steep banks are still strengthened at places with solid <span style="color: #0000FF;">masonry </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">According </span>to Herodotus the canal was four days<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>journey, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>according to<br/>
Pliny <span style="color: #0000FF;">62 </span>Roman miles, in length. It certainly <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>branch, towards the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">N.E </span>to Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">TimsM.1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ccrocoi1ile </span>lake<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>it may have flowed entirely in<br/>
that direction, and been continued thence to the Bitter Lakes. The name<br/>
of Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tiuuiilt </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">431</span>). moreover, indicates that it must once have been<br/>
connected with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>ancient times the canal was primarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructed </span>for purposes of navigation, and it is now used <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>numerous<br/>
small barges which convey the produce <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Egyptian soil to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'iliya<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>exportation, and bring back cargoes of coal and imported wares in<br/>
exchange; but the canal is now <span style="color: #ff0000;">chietly </span>important as a channel for conducting fresh water to the towns on its banks<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>particularly <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isma'iliya<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues</span>, and as a means of irrigating and fertilising the country through<br/>
which it passes (comp. p. 430). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Near </span>Cairo the canal diverges from the<br/>
Nile to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>of the viceroyal palace <span style="color: #0000FF;">l'iasr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Xil</span>. The volume of water<br/>
passing through it is regulated by locks, three between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefisheh </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Suez </span>and another of larger size at Suez itself. The surface of the canal<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ii</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft.. </span>and the bottom 26 ft. in width, <span style="color: #ff0000;">audit </span>averages <span style="color: #0000FF;">7 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">It</span>. in <span style="color: #ff0000;">depth </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>--The construction of a new and larger <span style="color: #ff0000;">fresh-Water </span>canal between Cairo<br/>
