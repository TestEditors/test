<br/>
when dry (in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>case alone the sound is heard) the traveller loosens<br/>
it and causes it to fall into the clefts of the sandstone rock on which it<br/>
lies; a slight and gradually increasing sound is thus produced by this<br/>
miniature avalanche. The Arabs believe that these curious sounds proceed from a monastery buried under the sand. It had been accidentally<br/>
discovered by an Arab, who received hospitable entertainment from the<br/>
monks, and swore not to betray its existence; but when <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>afterwards<br/>
broke his oath, the monastery vanished.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">FROM </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tin </span>TO THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">MONASTERY </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>ST. <span style="color: #ff0000;">CATHARINB </span>there are two<br/>
routes, one through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wédi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">llebrau</span>, the other through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tdi<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">es-Sléh </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Isléh</span>). The latter is the shorter and preferable route, as<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">es-Sléh </span>is one of the most romantic ravines in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole<br/>
</span>peninsula, while the route through the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fodi </span>Hebran is for some<br/>
distance the same as the shorter route from Suez to Sinai.<br/>
<br/>
(1) THROUGH THE WADI <span style="color: #0000FF;">les-SVS</span>. The start should be made<br/>
at a very early hour, in order that the desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-h'd'a </span>may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">crossed </span>before the heat of the day. We ride due E. for <span style="color: #0000FF;">G </span>hrs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>through<br/>
the gradually ascending desert in the direction of the huge Umm<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shumar </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">515 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. On reaching the base of the mountain, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">descend </span>very rapidly into a basin resembling the bed ofa lake, which<br/>
has been formed by the mountain torrent issuing from the Widi<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">es-Sléh</span>. At the bottom of this basin we enter the narrow, rocky<br/>
defile of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">es-Sléh</span>. After ascending this romantic gorge<br/>
with its turbulent <span style="color: #0000FF;">break </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-an-hour</span>, we reach a charming<br/>
resting-place <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>there is excellent water. The brook, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>of<br/>
course varies greatly in volume at different seasons, sometimes disappears altogether in the upper parts of the valley, but there is<br/>
water enough everywhere to support the vegetation, which is very<br/>
luxuriant at places. Palms and numerous tamarisks thrive in the<br/>
lower part of the valley. The route is not always practicable for<br/>
riding, but if the rider dismounts, the camels contrive to thread<br/>
their way through the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>part of the ravine, while the<br/>
traveller will find it a relief to walk for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">quarter-of-an-hour</span>. A<br/>
little above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">resting-place </span>large masses of rock compel us again<br/>
to dismount for <span style="color: #0000FF;">heir-en-hoary </span>walk. About 2 hrs. from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">entrance </span>of the valley, and 280 ft. above that point, the route divides, and we turn to the left. At the next bifurcation<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">10 </span>min<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>farther, our route leads to the right. We enter a rocky gorge which<br/>
soon contracts to a defile of <span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>only in width, then expands, and<br/>
again contracts. We pass a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trees</span>, many tamarisks, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Solaneze</span>, and thickets of reed. At the next bifurcation (1 hr.) we<br/>
turn to the right. We pass (20 min.) the precipitous bed of a<br/>
torrent on the right, and then a second descending from a curious<br/>
looking hill crowned with a huge mass of rock. The stony channel<br/>
of an old torrent here is deeply furrowed by that of another <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>which now crosses it. The valley becomes wilder and more<br/>
barren. We ascend the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tuli </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tarfu </span>for <span style="color: #ff0000;">5-6 </span>hrs. to a height of<br/>
about 1875 ft. We then enter the broad <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wdcli </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rahabeh</span>, and traverse an open and undulating basin for 6 hrs. more, first <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
