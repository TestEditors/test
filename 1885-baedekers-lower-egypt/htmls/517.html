<br/>
name of one of his successors. <span style="color: #0000FF;">About </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>paces farther on, a large<br/>
broken obelisk lies prostrate on the ground. Ten other obelisks<br/>
near it, in a still more shattered condition, testify to the ancient<br/>
glory of the city. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">loftiest </span>of them measured 46 and <span style="color: #ff0000;">49 </span>ft.<br/>
in height, and nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">5ft</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>in thickness. Some of them consisted of<br/>
very dark, and others of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tight-lured </span>syenite. Even the great<br/>
temple of imperial Thebes contained fewer obelisks than this vast<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>sanctuary. All these <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>owed their origin to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span>. The<br/>
museum at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bfilak </span>contains the finest of the Hyksos sphinxes<br/>
(p. 298) found here, while four others, more or less mutilated, still<br/>
remain here. Besides these there is a sphinx in the Egyptian<br/>
style, dating from the 19th Dynasty. The visitor should also<br/>
notice an interesting little chapel, resembling a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus</span>, and<br/>
composed of a single block of a granulous kind of alabaster. The<br/>
cavity is not much wider than the thickness of the sides. At the<br/>
back is represented the triad of Ammon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turn</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nut</span>. Another<br/>
colossal statue here, composed of rose-coloured or almost purple<br/>
granite, and a lion-headed statue of Sekhet were also erected by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramsesll</span>. Adjacent is a second statue of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.</span>, executed in<br/>
a flinty kind of sandstone, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured </span>Farther on, towards <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S.</span>, we next observe a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">granite'stole</span>' with finely executed<br/>
inscriptions, still easily legible, although damaged, mentioning a<br/>
mode of reckoning dates which has been met with nowhere else.<br/>
They are in honour of a distinguished <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>of the time of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, and bear the date of 400 years after the Pharaoh <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asetpehti</span>, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos </span>monarch. A considerable way beyond this <span style="color: #0000FF;">monument </span>is another excavated hollow containing fragments of a<br/>
temple, including several remarkably fine columns with curious<br/>
palm capitals. These capitals, which, like the columns themselves,<br/>
are of rose-coloured granite, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>narrower at their bases than the<br/>
shafts on which they rest. All the columns, now overthrown, are<br/>
remarkable for slenderness of form, and the bases on which they<br/>
stood were no less than <span style="color: #ff0000;">3ft</span>. in height, being higher than any<br/>
others yet discovered in Egypt. Towards the S.E. are several<br/>
round blocks, probably dating, according to the two inscriptions,<br/>
from the period of the Ptolemies. Leaving the hollow containing<br/>
the palm columns, we ascend without difficulty to the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sh√©kh </span>which commands the best survey of the ruins of Tanis.<br/>
Around the grey plateau of the town rise a series of hills, nearly<br/>
forming a circle, and once covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">dwelling-houses</span>. The ruins<br/>
of the temple form a mass of cubical blocks and black and red<br/>
fragments of obelisks, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the heaps of rubbish are mingled<br/>
with innumerable chips of broken pottery. The empty houses<br/>
resemble caverns, and show that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tanites </span>were contented with<br/>
dwellings of very moderate size. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">limestone'stelo</span>' discovered<br/>
here by Dr. Lepsius in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1866</span>, known as the Tablet of Tunis, or Decree<br/>
of Canopus, is now preserved in the museum at <span style="color: #0000FF;">new</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>(p. 313)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
