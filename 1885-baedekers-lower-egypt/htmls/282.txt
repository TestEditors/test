<br/>
</span>pass through the gates without undergoing an examination by the<br/>
custodian, and this custom still prevails at Damascus and in the<br/>
towns of Upper Egypt, such as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siut</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>former times, during the<br/>
prevalence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>conflicts, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>always attended<br/>
with the pillaging and assassination of many peaceful citizens,<br/>
the gates of the khans frequently remained closed for several days<br/>
together, for the purpose of affording protection against the outrages of these lawless mercenaries.<br/>
<br/>
The principal market-days are Monday and Thursday, when<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>in the narrow streets is so great that it becomes <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult<br/>
</span>or impossible to traverse them; but it is on these occasions that<br/>
the most characteristic scenes of Oriental life are witnessed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ped-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lers </span>are seen forcing their way through the crowd, shouting at the<br/>
top of their voices, sometimes carrying a small table with <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span>,<br/>
and frequently selling their wares by auction. So, too, we observe <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffee-sellers</span>, water-bearers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">nargileh-hawkers</span>, and others,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">elbowing </span>their way, landing their commodities, and escaping<br/>
accidents almost by a miracle. One of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">noisiest </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">frequenters </span>of<br/>
the bazaars is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jamil</span>, or auctioneer, who carries on his head or<br/>
shoulders the goods he is instructed to sell, and runs up and down<br/>
the lanes <span style="color: #ff0000;">shouting'liartty</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hurtig</span>', and adding the amount of the<br/>
last bid he has received. <span style="color: #0000FF;">However </span>great the confusion may be, his<br/>
practised <span style="color: #0000FF;">ear </span>instantly detects each new bid issuing from one of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dukkans</span>, and he immediately announces the new <span style="color: #0000FF;">oiler</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'bi'ishrin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tin-W</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'bi'islwin </span>u <span style="color: #ff0000;">nug</span>', and so on. The seller of the goods<br/>
always accompanies the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dallal </span>to give his consent to the conclusion<br/>
of the transaction.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is hardly possible to give the traveller any idea of the prices<br/>
of the various commodities, as they depend on the demand, which<br/>
is greater in winter than in summer, and also on the character of<br/>
the seller and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">demeanonr </span>of the purchaser. We may also<br/>
mention that many <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-eil </span>Oriental articles, particularly silks<br/>
and woollen stuffs, are now manufactured of inferior materials by<br/>
European firms, and exported to Egypt. Some articles again, such<br/>
as rugs and hangings, please the eye amid their native surroundings, but are rarely suitable for European rooms; while others are<br/>
more advantageously purchased in most European capitals than<br/>
from the Oriental merchants themselves, with whom bargaining<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>and troublesome. <span style="color: #0000FF;">So-sit </span>antiquities are largely sold<br/>
at the hotels at exorbitant prices, far exceeding their true value,<br/>
and many of them are even specially manufactured for the purpose.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Caution </span>in making a purchase is far more requisite in the East than<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lumpe</span>, as Orientals regard skill in cheating simply as <span style="color: #ff0000;">adesirahle<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aeemnplishment</span>. Those who purpose making large purchases had<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hotter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">defer </span>doing so until they have gained <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>experience ofthe<br/>
national <span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiarities</span>, and they should in no case rely on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">reconnnemlations </span>or advice of <span style="color: #ff0000;">commissionnaires </span>and persons of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
