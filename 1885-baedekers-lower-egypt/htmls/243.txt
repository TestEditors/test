<span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>is compelled by one party to worship <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>, and by another<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">worship </span>Christ. They are a refractory<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gOnd-fur-nothing</span>, and slanderous set of <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The city (Alexandria) possesses treasures and<br/>
resources in abundance. No <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span>'s hands here are idle. At one place<br/>
glass is manufactured, at another paper, and at another linen. All these<br/>
busy people seem to carry on some kind of handicraft. Men with gouty<br/>
feet, blind persons, and even those with gouty hands, all find some <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupation</span>. They all really recognise one god only (probably Mammon),<br/>
the same who is worshipped by Christians, Jews, and all nations. It<br/>
is a pity that the people <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>of so <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>a disposition, as the importance of<br/>
the city, even in point of size, makes it well worthy of being the capital of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span>every possible concession to the city,<br/>
restored its ancient privileges, and added so many new ones that the<br/>
citizens came and thanked me in person; and yet as soon as I had left<br/>
the place they <span style="color: #0000FF;">calumniated </span>my son Verus.'<br/>
<br/>
As at that period, so at the present day, the population <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofAlexandria </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">consists </span>of members of every nation dwelling on the banks<br/>
of the Mediterranean. The language most generally understood is<br/>
Italian, which the Arabs, as well as other nations, learn readily.<br/>
<br/>
Sights. Unless the traveller proposes to make archaeological<br/>
researches and to study the ancient topography of Alexandria, he<br/>
will easily become acquainted with its principal points of interest<br/>
in a single day (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">3206</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span>). Cairo <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ords </span>a far better insight<br/>
into Oriental life than its half-European seaport, while its delightful winter climate, notwithstanding the proximity of the two cities,<br/>
is far superior to that of Alexandria. In summer the reverse is the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">case</span>, as the heat at Alexandria is then tempered with cool <span style="color: #ff0000;">seahreezes</span>, but even as early as April, especially when the S. or <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E.<br/>
</span>wind prevails, the atmosphere there also is often hot and dusty.<br/>
The European should avoid any undue exertion, which may easily<br/>
be followed by very prejudicial <span style="color: #0000FF;">effects<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">new-comer </span>will nevertheless find it interesting to walk<br/>
through the town, and particularly to observe the busy streets with<br/>
their Oriental and European throng; and he will encounter, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>beyond the precincts of the Frank quarter, a number of isolated<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>of antiquity, in the shape of stumps of columns, blocks of<br/>
stone, and heaps of broken pottery. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is not an easy matter to give<br/>
the traveller distinct directions as to his route through the city, as<br/>
only the principal streets have well-recognised names. Most of the<br/>
new names given them by government are unfamiliar to Europeans<br/>
and Arabs alike, and have practically superseded the older names<br/>
in a few cases only. Some of the streets again are differently named<br/>
by Europeans of different nationalities. If the traveller loses his<br/>
way he will soon meet with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-boy </span>who will take him back<br/>
to his hotel (<span style="color: #0000FF;">oomph </span>p. 205). On the W. side of the city, and on<br/>
the neck <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">land </span>between the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">hath</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>the ancient Heptastadium, to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">h. </span>of the Place <span style="color: #ff0000;">lléhémot-Ali</span>, the inhabitants are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>of Arabian extraction (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span>, while the quarter which was<br/>
once the island of Pharos, farther to the N., is occupied by the<br/>
Turks. The streets here are somewhat broader than in the other<br/>
quarters, and the houses are sometimes handsomely built and <span style="color: #0000FF;">pro<br/>
