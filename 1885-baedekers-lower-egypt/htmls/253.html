</span>As far as <span style="color: #0000FF;">mm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the train follows the W. bank of the Rosetta branch<br/>
of the Nile, skirting the boundary between the Libyan desert and the<br/>
cultivated Delta of the Nile. The stations between Tell <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Bftrfid </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bfilftlg </span>are <span style="color: #ff0000;">1561</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">flamddeh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Et-Taryeh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kafr </span>deud, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ElJienetshi</span>. The station at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Email</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>is nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2 </span>M. from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hush</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Carriages not always to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>had.<br/>
<br/>
The cultivated land becomes richer, and we pass villages,<br/>
groups of trees, and even tamarisks. The train reaches the broad<br/>
Rosetta arm of the Nile, crosses it by a long iron bridge <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fine<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">View </span>to the left), and enters the station of (<span style="color: #ff0000;">05 </span>M.) Kafr <span style="color: #ff0000;">ezZaiyit </span>(second station at which the express stops, 2 hrs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">after<br/>
</span>leaving Alexandria; halt of 20 <span style="color: #0000FF;">min</span>.; restaurant). The town, which<br/>
carries on a busy trade in grain, cotton, and the other products of<br/>
the Delta (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">73</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, lies on the right bank of the river. Excursion<br/>

<br/>
The Delta <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Winter.'The fields are still wet at places, and straight<br/>
canals are seen in every direction. All the cereals grown in ancient times<br/>
still flourish here, and the slender palm still rears its fruit-laden <span style="color: #0000FF;">crown<br/>
</span>beside the less frequent sycamore, with its slender <span style="color: #0000FF;">umbrageous </span>foliage.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton-plants </span>are successfully cultivated where the soilis well irrigated,<br/>
and form extensive plantations of underwood, bearing a profusion of <span style="color: #0000FF;">yer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>low, red, and white blossoms, which somewhat resemble wild roses.<br/>
Vineyards are rare, but they sometimes occur in the northern part of<br/>
the Delta, the plants being trained on the trelliswork which we often<br/>
see represented in the paintings ot the ancient Egyptian tombs. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">water-wheels </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sitlsiyeh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>are turned by buffaloes and donkeys, and sometimes by camels or by steam; and the water-pail <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">shidfifL </span>though less<br/>
common than in Upper Egypt, is occasionally plied by slightly clad men<br/>
and boys. The canals are flanked with <span style="color: #ff0000;">emhankments </span>to protect the fields<br/>
from inundation, and the paths on these banks are enlivened with strings<br/>
of camels, donkeys with their riders, and men, women, and children on<br/>
foot. From a distance the villages look like round, grey hillocks, full of<br/>
openings, and around them rise dovecots and palm-trees. On closer<br/>
examination we distinguish the mud-huts, huddled together on rising<br/>
ground where they are safe from the inundation. Many of these hamlets<br/>
are adorned with very handsome groups of palms, while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">minarets<br/>
</span>which overtop the larger villages and towns seem to point as devoutly<br/>
to heaven as our Gothic <span style="color: #0000FF;">church</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">spires</span>'. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ebers</span>,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Goshen</span>', etc.)<br/>

<br/>
Opposite the station is an Inn kept by a Greek, which looks not<br/>
uninviting. The Greek Restaurant on the Canal, near the Bazaar, is <span style="color: #ff0000;">patronised </span>by European merchants from Cairo and Alexandria during the<br/>
fair of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanga</span>.<br/>

Seyyid Ahmed el-Bedawi is probably the most popular saint in Egypt,<br/>
and the most frequently invoked. He is said to have been born in the<br/>
12th cent. at Fez, or according to others at Tunis, and to have settled<br/>
