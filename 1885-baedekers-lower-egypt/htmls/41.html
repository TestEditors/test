an opportunity at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lulgsor</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh </span>of seeing very curious<br/>
and elaborate, though to his taste often <span style="color: #ff0000;">nngraceful </span>performances.<br/>
Most of the dancers congregate at the fair <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'fante </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">22O</span>, but<br/>
the most skilful decline to exhibit unless paid with gold. The<br/>
Hamel, or men in female attire, who frequently dance at festivities<br/>
instead of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ghawazi</span>, present a most repulsive appearance.<br/>
<br/>
The SNAKE CHARMERS (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Rifd'Zyeh</span>, sing. Rifa'i), who form another distinct caste, exhibit performances of a very marvellous<br/>
character, as credible European residents in Cairo have testified;<br/>
but the traveller will rarely come in contact with them. The ordinary<br/>
exhibition of dancing snakes may, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>be seen<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezhekiyeht </span>The boys who exhibit small snakes at the hotels<br/>
must of course not be confounded with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rifa'iyeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The JUGGLERS (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ham</span>) of Egypt are similar to those of other<br/>
countries. The performances of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">BUFFOONS </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kurndfiti </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahabbas0</span>, which are <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>intended for the amusement of the young,<br/>
are disgracefully <span style="color: #0000FF;">indelicate</span>.<br/>

(13). Baths.<br/>
<br/>
The baths of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>with their <span style="color: #0000FF;">hot-air </span>chambers, are those commonly known as Turkish, but they are neither so clean <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>so well<br/>
fitted up as some of those in the larger cities of Europe.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harare </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span>see Plan), as well as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maghtas </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hunafiyeh</span>,<br/>
have flat ceilings in which are openings covered with stained<br/>
glass. The maghtas and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llanafiyeh </span>each contain marble basins<br/>
for washing, provided with taps for warm water; the maghtas<br/>
contain besides a bath sunk in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pavement </span>Cold water is brought<br/>
in ewers. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">lw'rc'zra</span>, or general bath-chamber, is less heated than<br/>
the separate rooms, and is filled with steam. All the chambers<br/>
are paved with marble slabs and heated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">dues </span>under the pavement<br/>
and behind the walls.<br/>
<br/>
When a cloth is hung up at the entrance to the baths, it indicates that women only are admitted. The baths are always cleanest<br/>
in the early morning. Fridays are to be avoided, as numerous Muslims<br/>
bathe early on that day, which is their Sabbath.<br/>
<br/>
The visitor first enters a large vaulted chamber covered with a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cupola </span>{ <span style="color: #0000FF;">hOsh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-rarnrruhr/ </span>having a fountain of cold water in the<br/>
centre (<span style="color: #ff0000;">fuslciyeh</span>), and the bathing towels hung around on strings,<br/>
these last being swung into their places or taken down with bamboo<br/>
rods according to requirement. Having taken off his shoes and<br/>
given them to the attendant, the visitor is next conducted to one<br/>
of the raised divans which are still unoccupied, where he proceeds<br/>
to undress. Valuables may, if desired, be entrusted to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bath<br/>
</span>owner. Wrapping a cloth round his loins, he leaves his divan, is<br/>
provided with pattens or wooden shoes (<span style="color: #ff0000;">loablcab</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and is conducted<br/>
to the hot room (<span style="color: #0000FF;">harem</span>) in the interior of the establishment. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Near<br/>
