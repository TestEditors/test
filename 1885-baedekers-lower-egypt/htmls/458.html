<br/>
S. group of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salilihra</span>, a ride of <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>to the S. of Mariette's<br/>
House. We pass the step-pyramid and the pyramid of Unas<br/>
on the left. Exactly in a line with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">step-pyramid</span>, parallel<br/>
with its W. side, and about a thousand paces to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span>of it, we<br/>
observe a space of ground enclosed by broad and massive, but now<br/>
very dilapidated, walls on the E., N., and <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>sides, while the S.<br/>
side is bounded by the natural hills of the desert. The object of<br/>
this enclosure is a mystery to Egyptologists. M. Mariette, however,<br/>
conjectured, with much probability, that the place was used as a<br/>
pen for the numerous cattle slaughtered here as victims. Repeated excavations have been made within the precincts of the enclosure, but without result. <span style="color: #ff0000;">EaCh </span>side is 440 yds. in length.<br/>
<br/>
Proceeding hence towards the Mastaba <span style="color: #0000FF;">Far'fin</span>, we observe the<br/>
tomb rising before us at no great distance, so that the route to it<br/>
cannot be mistaken. To the left are the dilapidated Pyramids of<br/>
Pepi I. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Solcar</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">em-saf</span>. On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. side of the mastaba is<br/>
the still more dilapidated Pyramid of Pepi 11., now used by<br/>
the Arabs as a quarry. All these pyramids are constructed exactly<br/>
in the same manner as that of King Unas (p. 383), but they are in<br/>
such a ruined and dangerous condition that the director of the<br/>
museum has had them all closed again, previously taking an accurate copy of the inscriptions they contain .--<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tthastaba </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Far'un</span>,<br/>
which may be ascended, is oblong in form, like all the other tombs<br/>
of the kind, with walls sloping inwards. The entrance is on the N.<br/>
side. It was first explored by <span style="color: #ff0000;">M.Mariette</span>, who believed that it<br/>
was the tomb of King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ullas </span>(p. 383).<br/>
<br/>
We may either retrace our steps hence to Mariette's House,<br/>
or traverse a depression to the N. of the mastaba, opening towards the E., and leading direct to the village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakhara</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>several days have been allowed for the excursion to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>, the<br/>
traveller may next proceed to visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dahshur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>situated <span style="color: #ff0000;">3/</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span>hr. to the S. of<br/>
the Mastaba <span style="color: #0000FF;">Far'fin</span>. This place is perhaps identical with the Acanthus<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Diodorus, where a leaky cask is once said to have stood, into which<br/>
water from the Nile was daily poured by 360 priests. On the margin of<br/>
the desert there still grow numerous sunt trees, as in ancient times. On<br/>
the desert plateau of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahshfir </span>rise two large and two smaller pyramids<br/>
of limestone, and two of brick, together with remains of others, all of<br/>
which are at a considerable distance from each <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>The northernmost<br/>
brick pyramid, which was once covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">511111 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Stone</span>, is curious.<br/>
It is sometimes pointed out, but without any authority, as the fabulous<br/>
pyramid which Herodotus mentions as having been erected by King<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Asychis</span>, who is said to have compelled his labourers to make bricks of<br/>
mud laboriously obtained from the bottom of a lake by means of poles.<br/>
The entrance on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span>side was once approached by a vestibule. The present height of the pyramid is about 90 ft. only.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>side of another ruined pyramid, situated to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span>. of<br/>
the last, are traces of two embankments (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MO</span>, descending towards the<br/>
E. from the larger Stone Pyramid <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the W. The last is still <span style="color: #0000FF;">32051. </span>in<br/>
height and 234 yds<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>in width, being nearly as large as the Great Pyramid<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eh </span>and in its solitude presents a very imposing appearance, even<br/>
to an accustomed eye.<br/>
<br/>
To the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>and S. are remains of several other pyramids. Still <span style="color: #0000FF;">farther<br/>
</span>to the S. rises a pyramid of peculiar form, sometimes called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Blamed<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
