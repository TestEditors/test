'partly uncovered. The street of tombs, which is now accessible, presents the appearance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ahill</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">side </span>covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>masonry, <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrusted </span>with<br/>
stucco, and provided with <span style="color: #0000FF;">ante-chambers</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">month </span>of each tomb is<br/>
towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the leaning external walls are generally of Nile bricks,<br/>
richly embellished with the linear patterns which afterwards formed the<br/>
favourite decorations of the sides of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>(which were imitations of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-facades</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The vestibule is in most cases <span style="color: #ff0000;">comparativcly </span>large, but the inner corridors are narrow, slope downwards, and<br/>
are covered with representations in a remarkably simple and antiquated<br/>
style. The archaic character of the scenes and of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics<br/>
</span>proves the great antiquity of these monuments. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic </span>canon is already traceable here, but it does not appear to have<br/>
hampered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">efforts </span>of the artists as much as it did at a later age. The<br/>
admirably preserved colours are also less conventional than those seen in<br/>
later monuments.<br/>
<br/>
The first open tomb which we reach from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span>, was that of Prince<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Q<br/>
</span>(Erpa <span style="color: #0000FF;">He</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefermat</span>, who lived in the reign of King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Teter </span>(There<br/>
<br/>
were <span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">kings </span>of this name, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ist</span>, 3rd, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">6th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dynasty</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left<br/>
wall of the corridor leading to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chamber</span>, we see the deceased<br/>
in a sitting posture, and on the right wall he is represented <span style="color: #0000FF;">standing</span>,<br/>
with his wife behind him. Adjacent are men and women presenting<br/>
offerings, as in the mastabas of <span style="color: #0000FF;">T </span>and Ptahhotep. The flesh-tint of the men<br/>
is red<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and that of the women pale yellow, and this circumstance, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>in a monument of this early period, is important as tending to<br/>
prove the Asiatic origin of the Egyptian nobles. The features of the<br/>
persons represented are of the Caucasian, and not of the Ethiopian<br/>
type. Among the villages belonging to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefermat</span>, which offered gifts<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>there appears on the left the name of the district of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rs</span>: <span style="color: #0000FF;">+<br/>

a district named that'of the white sow<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, which proves that pigs were reared<br/>
in Egypt as early as the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Snefru. The pig in this group is <span style="color: #ff0000;">very<br/>

or'place of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">plough </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">g</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>ancient form of the plough is used<br/>
as a determinative symbol. The advanced condition of industrial <span style="color: #ff0000;">pursuits</span>, showing that the Egyptians already practised the art in which,<br/>
according to Pliny, they afterwards excelled, is proved by the character<br/>
of the dress worn by the women represented on the right side of the<br/>
first passage, consisting of black and white <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton </span>stuff, with pleasing<br/>
patterns on the borders. He tells us that they were not in the habit of<br/>
painting the materials for their dress, but of dipping them in certain<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tluids</span>. They were coloured with boiling dyes, and came out impressed<br/>
with a pattern. Although the boilers contained one colour only, it is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span>to have imparted several <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>tints to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stuffs </span>dyed in them.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>In order to impart a durable colour to the larger figures represented<br/>
here, an entirely unique process was employed. The outlines were <span style="color: #0000FF;">engraved </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the stone, while the surfaces enclosed by them were divided<br/>
into deeply incised squares, which were <span style="color: #0000FF;">titled </span>with stucco of different<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colours</span>, the flesh-tint of the men being red, that of the women yellow,<br/>
and the colour of the robes being white, etc.<br/>

A little farther <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the N. is the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the wife <span style="color: #0000FF;">er </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chuz-mit</span>.<br/>

engaged in snaring birds, while a servant presents the spoil to the mistress of the house<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">complexion </span>is of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>brilliant yellow. On the<br/>
outside wall, to the left, we observe the cattle of the deceased browsing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>reeds. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right stands <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nefcrmfit</span>, who, as the inscription <span style="color: #ff0000;">informs<br/>
