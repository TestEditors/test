may often be employed with advantage. We may again remind the<br/>
traveller that it is advisable to rest once or oftener <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the way up,<br/>
in order to avoid the discomfort of arriving breathless and heated at<br/>
the summit. The space at the top at present measures about<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>sq. yds. in area, so that there is abundant room for a large<br/>
party of visitors.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wa </span>is remarkably interesting and striking. There is<br/>
perhaps no other prospect in the world in which life and death,<br/>
fertility and desolation, are seen in so close juxtaposition and in<br/>
such marked <span style="color: #0000FF;">contrast </span>To the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>W. and NW.) extend yellowish<br/>
brown and glaring tracts of sand, interspersed with barren cliffs.<br/>
The huge and colourless monuments erected here by the hand of<br/>
man remind the spectator, like the desert itself, of death and<br/>
eternity. On a bare plateau of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock </span>stand the other pyramids and<br/>
the Sphinx, rearing its head from the sand, like some monster suffocated by the dust. To the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, in the distance, rise the pyramids<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abnsir</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakhira</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dahshfir</span>, and to the N. those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Roash</span>. The scene is deathlike, the colouring yellow and brown.<br/>
Towards the E., on the other hand, glitters the river, on each bank<br/>
of which stretches a tract of rich arable land, luxuriantly clothed<br/>
with blue-green vegetation, and varying in breadth. The fields are<br/>
intersected in every direction by canals<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>on the banks of which rise<br/>
stately palms, waving their flexible fan-like leaves, and interlacing<br/>
their shadows over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah </span>villages perched like ant-hills on<br/>
embankments and mounds. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the direction of Cairo runs the long<br/>
straight <span style="color: #0000FF;">carriage-road</span>. Immediately before <span style="color: #ff0000;">usrises </span>the Citadel with<br/>
the striking minarets of the mosque of Mohammed'Ali, while the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">blokattam </span>hills, which form the chief mass of colour in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landscape</span>, gleam in the morning with a pale golden tint, and in the<br/>
evening with a violet hue.<br/>
<br/>
The descent of the Great Pyramid is more rapidly accomplished<br/>
than the ascent, but is hardly less fatiguing, and the traveller will<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>the help of the Arabs not <span style="color: #0000FF;">unacceptable</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

interior of the Great Pyramid are at present closed; but, to prevent<br/>
confusion, we shall not mention these until we have described<br/>
those which are still shown. An interval of rest between the ascent<br/>
and the expedition into the interior is again recommended.<br/>
<br/>
The Entrance (<span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>) is on the thirteenth tier of stones, on the<br/>
N. side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">structure'i</span>, and at a perpendicular height of 48 ft.<br/>
