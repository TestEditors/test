</span>degenerate into a body of <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>empty forms, while he also rejected<br/>
their dogmatic teaching as utterly false. Above all he repudiated<br/>
whatever seemed to him to savour of polytheism, including the<br/>
doctrine of the Trinity, as'assigning partners' to the one and<br/>
only God. Every human being who possesses a capacity for belief<br/>
he considered bound to accept the new revelation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Islam</span>,<br/>
and every Muslim is bound to promulgate this faith. Practically,<br/>
however, this stringency was afterwards relaxed, as the Muslims<br/>
found themselves obliged to enter into <span style="color: #0000FF;">pacific </span>treaties with nations<br/>
beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confines </span>of Arabia. A distinction was also drawn between peoples who were already in possession of a revelation, such<br/>
as Jews, Christians, and Sabians, and idolaters, the last of whom<br/>
were to be rigorously persecuted.<br/>
<br/>
The Muslim creed is embodied in the words:'There is no God<br/>
but God (Allah <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>is the prophet of God' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">iMha<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">itt</span>' Allah). This formula, however,<br/>
contains the most important doctrine only; for the Muslim is bound<br/>
to believe in three cardinal points: <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>) God and the angels, (<span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span>written revelation and the prophets, and (3) the resurrection, judgment, eternal life, and predestination.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">AND </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">THEANGBLS</span>. According to comparatively modern<br/>
inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>'Syrie Centrale', pp. 9, 10) it would appear that the<br/>
emphatic assertion of the unity of God is by no means peculiar to<br/>
Mohammedanism. As God is a Spirit, embracing all perfection<br/>
within Himself, ninety-nine of his different attributes were afterwards gathered from the Koran, each of which is represented by a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">head </span>of the Muslim rosary. Great importance is also attached to<br/>
the fact that the creation of the world was effected by a simple effort<br/>
of the divine will. (God said'Let there be', and there was.)<br/>
<br/>
The story of the creation in the Koran is taken from the Bible,<br/>
with variations from Rabbinical, Persian, and other sources. God<br/>
first created his throne; beneath the throne there was water; the<br/>
<br/>
began with ardent enthusiasm to promulgate monotheism, and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">want<br/>
</span>his hearers against incurring the pains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">helL </span>It is uncertain whether<br/>
Mohammed himself could read and write. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>new doctrine was called<br/>
Islam, or subjection to God. At first he made converts in his own family<br/>
only, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Muslims</span>' were persecuted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Meccans</span>. Many of them,<br/>
and at length Mohammed himself (622), accordingly emigrated to Medina,<br/>
where the new religion made great progress. After the death of Khadija,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammad </span>took several other <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wives</span>, partly from political motives.<br/>
<br/>
He now <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to stir up the Meccans, and war broke out in<br/>
consequence. He was victorious at Bedr, but lost the battle of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uhud</span>.<br/>
His military campaigns were <span style="color: #0000FF;">thenceforth </span>incessant. He obtained great<br/>
influence over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, and succeeded in uniting them politically.<br/>
In 630 the Muslims at length captured the town of Mecca, and the idols<br/>
in it were destroyed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed</span>'s health, however, had been completely<br/>
undermined by his unremitting exertions for about twenty-four years;<br/>
he died on 8th June, 632, at Medina, and was interred there.<br/>
