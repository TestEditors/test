is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Waghorn </span>Quay, bearing a Statue of Lieutenant <span style="color: #0000FF;">Waghorn</span>,<br/>
an enterprising Englishman, who after having spent the best years<br/>
of his life in establishing regular communication between England<br/>
and India <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span>Egypt, died in London in poverty in 1850. M. de<br/>
Lesseps has placed a French inscription to his memory on the W.<br/>
side of the monument.<br/>

The large basin farther S., <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>has been named Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibn'ihim</span>, and is capable. of containing 50 vessels of the largest size,<br/>
is divided by massive <span style="color: #0000FF;">bulwarks </span>into two parts, one for vessels of<br/>
war, and the other for the mail steamers and trading vessels.<br/>
<br/>
The mouth of the dock is protected by gates. The masonry is<br/>
everywhere admirably constructed, particularly that of the massive<br/>
breakwater outside the <span style="color: #0000FF;">doc </span>The dry dock is <span style="color: #0000FF;">123 </span>yds. long,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">25 </span>yds. wide, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">29 </span>ft. in depth.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the E. side <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>docks are stakes and buoys indicating the<br/>
entrance to the Suez Canal (p. 431), which is at a considerable distance from the N. extremity of the gulf. (Small boat, see p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">410</span>.)<br/>

The whole of the route thither by land traverses the sand of the<br/>
desert, skirting the sea, which lies to the right. Towards the W.<br/>
tower the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imposing'Attica </span>Mts. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>415), which present a most<br/>
picturesque appearance on the return route. To the left rise<br/>
the yellowish ranges of the Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">er-hhtlja</span>, belonging to the long<br/>
chain of the Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Tih</span>, and facing the S.E. We are <span style="color: #0000FF;">now<br/>
</span>traversing Asiatic soil, while at the same time the eye ranges over<br/>
part of the African continent.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Ut </span>this point, as at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hellespont</span>, two different quarters of the<br/>
globe adjoin each other; but, instead of Europe, we here have the<br/>
greater continent of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Africa </span>lying to the W. of Asia. The meeting of<br/>
these two neighbours here<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>however, is of a very different character.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">While </span>Europe and Asia salute each other across the Bosphorus and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hellespont</span>, adorned with verdant robes and crowned with laurel, as if about<br/>
to vie with each other in a peaceful contest of song, Asia and Africa<br/>
seem to <span style="color: #0000FF;">scowl </span>at each other across the Red Sea like wrestlers who have<br/>
divested themselves of their garments and are on the point of entering<br/>
the lists to fight a fierce battle for the sovereignty of the world. On the<br/>
African side <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Atalia </span>Mts. present a bold and menacing appearance,<br/>
while the dreary desert of Asia, situated among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Raha</span>, bids<br/>
defiance to its <span style="color: #ff0000;">lofticr </span>adversary'. (Schubert)<br/>
<br/>
Those who make the excursion by water <span style="color: #0000FF;">need </span>hardly be reminded<br/>
of the profound historical interest attaching to this part of the<br/>
Red Sea.<br/>
<br/>
'This is the scene of Pharaoh's attempted passage<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and these waves<br/>
were once ploughed by the ships of King Hiram and King Solomon,<br/>
which every three years brought gold from Ophir, and ivory, ebony, and<br/>
incense, to the harbours of Elath and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ezion-Geber</span>. Here, too, once plied<br/>
the light Moorish vessels mentioned in the Old Testament, and similar<br/>
to the craft now used by the Indo-Arabians. From this point the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phoenician </span>mariners employed by King Nacho began their famous <span style="color: #0000FF;">circumnavigation </span>of Africa about the year B.C. 600, and at a later period enter<br/>
