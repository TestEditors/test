town<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>with beautiful shady avenues, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">palace </span>in bad preservation. It<br/>
is the capital of a province of the same name, which is said to contain 169<br/>
villages with about 100,000 inhabitants<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and is the residence of a Mudir.<br/>
Post and telegraph office<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and a small bazaar<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The market days present<br/>
a busy scene, but the dirty streets are almost deserted at other times.<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">10</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Peninsula of Sinai.<br/>
<br/>
The journey to Mount Sinai is perhaps the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>interesting of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oriental </span>expeditions, particularly to the student of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bible </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">+</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>he will <span style="color: #0000FF;">traverse </span>nearly the same route as that of the Israelites described in the<br/>
Bible (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">1811</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The peninsula of Mt. Sinai owes its imperishable fame<br/>
to the vicissitudes undergone by these wanderers under the leadership<br/>
of their great lawgiver; but the scenery is also so varied that it will<br/>
amply repay the traveller for all the privations of his journey, which,<br/>
after all, are not more serious than those of a tour through the interior<br/>
of Palestine. The usual duration of the Mt. Sinai expedition is <span style="color: #0000FF;">17-20<br/>
</span>days (<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span>, however, <span style="color: #0000FF;">P. </span>475).<br/>
<br/>
The best <span style="color: #0000FF;">SEASON </span>for the journey is between the middle of February<br/>
and the end of April, and between the beginning of October and the<br/>
middle of November. During the months of November, December, and<br/>
January, the nights are generally very cold, while in summer the glare<br/>
of the sun, reflected from the granite rocks of the Sinai mountains, is<br/>
very oppressive. Even at the end of May the weather is hot, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lihamsin </span>(p. 69) prevalent (setting in sometimes as early as April ], but<br/>
at this advanced season the traveller will have the advantage of seeing<br/>
the manna (p. 500), or fruit of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">there </span>shrub, in its ripe condition.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">PREPARATIONS </span>for thejourney require special care. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">startingpoinlt </span>is Suez, but all the preliminaries must <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>arranged at Cairo, where<br/>
alone are to be found the necessary dragomans and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Slickhs </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tawara </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>(p. 478). who act as guides and <span style="color: #0000FF;">let </span>camels during the<br/>
travelling season. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>thing is to engage a good <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3</span>),<br/>
who provides camels, tents<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>bedding, blankets, and provisions. All these<br/>
should <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">examine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairn</span>, and the tents pitched by way of <span style="color: #0000FF;">experiment</span>. The more carefully this inspection is made, and any <span style="color: #0000FF;">detects<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">though </span>it is not the object of the handbook to enter upon the<br/>
province of Biblical criticism. the views of the principal explorers are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">briefly </span>given in connection with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>places. As the great charm<br/>
of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">through </span>the Peninsula consists in its associations with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ti </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er </span>the Exodus <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Israelites, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">promulgation </span>of<br/>
the law <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1181 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the traveller should of course <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>provided with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">copy<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>Sacred Volume, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>at least with the books of Exodus and<br/>
Numbers<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
