</span>rod, to which a panther-skin, the garb of his priests, is attached.<br/>
In consequence of his function of promoting vegetable life, his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">wanderings</span>, and perhaps also on account of this staff and skin, he<br/>
was termed <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dionysos </span>[ or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bacchus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>by the Greeks.<br/>
<br/>
Typhon-Seth. The name Typhon is most probably of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greek<br/>
</span>origin. The Egyptians named him Seth, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sutekh</span>, and represented<br/>
<br/>
him as a fabulous animal N, or with the head of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">animal</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>and subsequently as an ass, an animal which was sacred to him, or<br/>
with an ass's head. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>name is met with in the most remote period, but he appears originally to have been worshipped merely as<br/>
a god of war and the tutelary deity of foreigners. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>is usually<br/>
styled the brother of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>, and the two are called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Reliehui</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>or<br/>
hostile twins, who wounded each other in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle </span>above described. At a later period, after the god of battles and of foreigners<br/>
had shown himself permanently <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>to the Egyptians,<br/>
they ceased to render service to him, and erased his name from<br/>
the monuments on which it occurred, and even from the cartouches<br/>
of the most highly extolled kings. With regard to his connection<br/>
with the myth of Osiris and <span style="color: #ff0000;">lsis</span>, see p. 130.<br/>
<br/>
Nephthys, the wife of Seth, was called by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greeks </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Aphrodite<br/>
</span>or Nike (Victory), probably on account of her being the wife of<br/>
the god of war. Her proper sphere was the<br/>
nether world. In the upper world she occurs as<br/>
the nurse or <span style="color: #0000FF;">instructress </span>of the youthful <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>,<br/>
and she appears with <span style="color: #ff0000;">lsis</span>, mourning <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beating<br/>
</span>her forehead, at the funeral rites of Osiris,<br/>
whom she had loved, and to whom, being mistaken by him in the dark for <span style="color: #ff0000;">lsis</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>she had borne<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Anubis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">She </span>is also associated with Osiris and<br/>
Isis, with the youthful <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus </span>and Isis, and<br/>
even, as one of a tetrad, with Osiris, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lsis</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>She is usually represented with the sym<br/>

Horus, who occurs in many different forms, invariably represents<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">upper </span>world or region of light, and also regeneration, resurrection, and the ultimate triumph of good over evil, of life over<br/>
death, of light over darkness, and of truth over falsehood. He <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
