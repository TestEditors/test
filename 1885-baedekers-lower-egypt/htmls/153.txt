<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">iris </span>is the principle of light, while Typhon is that of darkness,<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">defeats </span>and banishes to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">internal </span>regions. Isis <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilathor<br/>
</span>mourns over his disappearance, follows him towards the<br/>
West, where she gives birth<br/>
to Horus, who annihilates<br/>
darkness and restores his<br/>
father to his lost position.<br/>
When Ra is termed the soul<br/>
of Osiris, the meaning is that<br/>
he renders visible the hidden<br/>
principle of light <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris</span>).<br/>
When, on the other hand,<br/>
Osiris is regarded as <span style="color: #0000FF;">emblem'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">atical </span>of the principle of<br/>
moisture, the most perfect<br/>
embodiment of which is the<br/>
god Hapi, or the Nile, Typhon<br/>
and his seventy-two companions represent the days of<br/>
drought. Like the dead body<br/>
of Osiris, the water flows towards the North, and the languishing Isis, that is, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit-bearing </span>earth<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>mourns over the loss of the fertilising power;<br/>
but this is for a short period only, for lIorus soon <span style="color: #0000FF;">vanquishes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Typhon </span>in the southern districts, and the rising Nile again begins to<br/>
impregnate the black soil with abundant fertility. Lastly, when<br/>
Osiris is regarded as the principle of life, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lsis</span>, the earth, is the<br/>
scene of the operation of that principle, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>Typhon represents<br/>
death, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>the resurrection. If we regard Osiris, as the<br/>
monuments so frequently do, as a pure and perfect being, the<br/>
principle of the good and the beautiful, in which case he receives the<br/>
surname of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Un-Nefcr</span>, we recognise in Typhon the discords with<br/>
which life is so replete, but which seem to be permitted only in order<br/>
that the purity <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>harmonies into which they are resolved through<br/>
the intervention of Horus may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>the more thoroughly appreciated.<br/>
Osiris, according to the esoteric doctrine, is also the sovereign of<br/>
the lower regions and the judge of souls, which, if found pure, are<br/>
permitted to unite with his. The dead, therefore, do not merely go<br/>
to Osiris, but actually become Osiris. Osiris is always represented<br/>
with a human head. He either sits as a king on his throne, or appears in the form of a mummy. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>always wields the scourge and<br/>
crook, and sometimes other emblems also. The crown of Upper<br/>
Egypt which he wears on his head is usually garnished before and<br/>
behind with the ostrich feathers of truth. Beside him, even in<br/>
very ancient representations, stands a kind of thyrsus or entwined<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
