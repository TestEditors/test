MUSICIANS by profession. <span style="color: #ff0000;">called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lildttyeh </span>(sing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">man</span>), are indispensable on every festive occasion. The usual instruments are<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">watch </span>or tambourine with little <span style="color: #0000FF;">bells</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">nahlcdrch</span>, or semispherical tambourine, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gemr </span>or hautbois, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tub</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>beledi or<br/>

of <span style="color: #0000FF;">funnel-shaped </span>drum (generally made of earthenware, but sometimes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mother-of-pearl </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">tortoise-shell</span>, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fish</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">skin </span>stretched over the broad end), which last is accompanied by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">zummém</span>,<br/>
a kind of double flute. A better class of instruments, used for<br/>
chamber music, consists of the wit, a kind of flute, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">kemengch </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">two-stringed </span>violin, the body of which consists <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cocca-nnt </span>shell,<br/>

The Egyptians consider themselves a highly musical people, and the<br/>
traveller will indeed often he struck by the frequency of their singing.<br/>
The Egyptian sings when indulging in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">her </span>(p. 23), whether sitting<br/>
on his heels or stretched out on his mat, when driving his donkey, when<br/>
carrying stones and mortar up a scaffolding, when working in the fields,<br/>
and when rowing. He sings <span style="color: #0000FF;">whether </span>alone or in company, regarding his<br/>
vocal music as a means of lightening his labour and of sweetening his<br/>
repose. A peculiarity of the Egyptian songs, however, is that they have<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>tune, though they have a certain rhythm, which is always dependent<br/>
on the text. They are sung through the nose on seven or eight <span style="color: #0000FF;">different<br/>
</span>notes, on which the performer wanders up and down as he feels <span style="color: #0000FF;">inclined</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">+ </span>The character of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">su-called </span>music is exceedingly monotonous,<br/>
and to a European ear displeasing. The songs (<span style="color: #ff0000;">mawwttl </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">shughl</span>) are all of<br/>

made to reduce Arabic music to a system, and the notes are divided<br/>
into seven different keys, each having the same notes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">differently </span>arranged;<br/>
but the popular songs are sung without the least regard to these artificial<br/>
rules.<br/>
