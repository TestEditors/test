The "North Side of the chamber is adorned with the most<br/>
elaborate and best preserved scenes. The lowest of these consists of<br/>
a long procession of 36 female figures <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>of a pale yellowish colour,<br/>
see p. 381 ], bearing on their heads large baskets filled with<br/>
various kinds of agricultural produce, bottles, jars, and loaves,<br/>
carrying poultry in their hands (and in one case a porcupine in a<br/>
cage), and leading cattle by ropes. The inscription above them records that this is <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'Offering </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>drink and food from<br/>
the villages of the family estate of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chamberlain </span>Ti situated in<br/>
Lower and Upper Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. Adjoining each figure is the name of the<br/>
place which it represents. Each name is accompanied by that of<br/>
Ti, the proprietor, and the order is in accordance with the most<br/>
valued products, the industries, and the situation of the place represented. Thus we observe a Water-drawing Ti <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>probably so <span style="color: #0000FF;">call<br/>

an Island Ti, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Sycamore Ti, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>Bread Ti, and a Cake Ti.<br/>
<br/>
Above these are rustic cattle scenes. A cow is represented <span style="color: #0000FF;">calving</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>and another is being milked, while an overseer, apparently<br/>

the right of these are a number of frisky young calves, tethered to<br/>
blocks of wood, and browsing or shipping about. Near the left<br/>
angle we observe a dwarf leading an ape, resembling the longtailed monkeys of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sfitl√©ll</span>, and a man with a deformed <span style="color: #0000FF;">shoulder<br/>
