The architects of the tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beui </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hasan</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">however </span>were not<br/>
unacquainted <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a light and elegant mode of building above<br/>
ground, which cannot have originated in the grotto <span style="color: #0000FF;">architecture<br/>

This is proved by their use of the lotus-column (Fig. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>), the<br/>
prototype of which is a group of four lotus-stalks bound together<br/>
and secured at the top by rings or ligatures, the capital being formed<br/>
by the blossoms. These columns, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>contrast strongly with the<br/>
massive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Proto-Done</span>, suggest a light style of garden architecture<br/>
in wood.<br/>
<br/>
While the architecture of the eleventh and twelfth dynasties<br/>
bears some slight resemblance to the earlier style, the sculpture of<br/>
the same period presents an almost total deviation from the ancient<br/>
traditions. The primitive, lifelike realism to which we have already alluded is displaced by the rigorous sway of the CANON, by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>all proportions are determined by <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>rules, and all forms<br/>
