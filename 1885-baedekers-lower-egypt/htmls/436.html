i.e.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'provided </span>with steps<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>), a very conspicuous feature in the landscape, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Cognisance </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saklsara</span>', may be inspected by the<br/>
traveller externally <span style="color: #0000FF;">either </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>going or returning. Egyptologists differ<br/>
as to the period <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofits </span>construction. Some authorities, relying on<br/>
a passage of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manetho</span>, in which it is stated <span style="color: #ff0000;">that'ho </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">LUnenephes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]<br/>
</span>built the pyramid at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cochome</span>', attribute the monument to a king<br/>
of the lst Dynasty. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cochome </span>was the Greek form of the hieroglyphic name Ka-kam <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>'the black bull'), which occurs on <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'stelCS'<br/>
</span>and sarcophagi of the Apis tombs as a place in the vicinity of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>this view be correct, we have before us the most<br/>
ancient structure in the world. Other authorities, however, reject<br/>
this view, and assign the monument to the period of the 5th Dynasty, but for equally slender reasons. The pyramid consists of six<br/>
stages, the lowest of which is about 373/4 ft. in height, the next<br/>
36 ft., the third 341/2 ft., the fourth <span style="color: #0000FF;">32</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span>, the fifth 31 ft., and<br/>
the sixth <span style="color: #ff0000;">291/3 </span>ft., while each stage is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">61/12 </span>ft. in width. The<br/>
peculiarity of the pyramid is not its graduated form, as every other<br/>
pyramid when deprived of its external <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation </span>would present<br/>
the same appearance (comp. p. 350), but consists in the facts that<br/>
it does not stand like all the others exactly facing the principal<br/>
points of the compass, that the area it covers is oblong instead of<br/>
square (N. and S. sides 354 ft., E. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>sides 398 ft.) and in<br/>
particular that it contains a very numerous and complicated series<br/>
of passages and chambers in the interior. The unique form of these<br/>
chambers, which were explored by General <span style="color: #0000FF;">Minutoli </span>in 1821, led<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Mariette to conjecture that they once contained the Apis tombs<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">primeval </span>monarchy. Two of the chambers are said to have<br/>
been decorated with convex pieces of green <span style="color: #0000FF;">fayence</span>, inlaid in a peculiar way in stucco, so as to form a kind of mosaic. A richly gilded<br/>
skull and gilded soles of feet, together with other interesting <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics<br/>
</span>found here and numerous treasures collected by Minutoli, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfortunately </span>lost at the mouth of the Elbe. The door of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppyramid </span>with its <span style="color: #ff0000;">architravc </span>of white limestone covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">door-posts </span>formed of somewhat rough blocks of<br/>
limestone and green glazed bricks, were removed by Lepsius in<br/>
1845 to the museum at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berlin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>This pyramid must have been<br/>
used for <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>purposes from the great pyramids <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh</span>, but<br/>
the scanty inscriptions found here afford no information on the<br/>
subject. At one point on the S. side, where the outer masonry<br/>
has been destroyed, the jointing of the stones may be inspected.<br/>
The material used is an inferior clayey kind of limestone quarried<br/>
in the neighbourhood. The pyramid may be ascended without<br/>
danger, but on no account without the help of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lleduins</span>,<br/>
as the surface is crumbling and treacherous. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ton </span>one occasion,<br/>
during the period of the inundation, M. Mariette met with a<br/>
troop of wild boars on the third step.) The view from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sum<br/>
