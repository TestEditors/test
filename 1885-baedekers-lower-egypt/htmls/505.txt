the Damietta arm of the Nile, as the bar at its mouth is constantly<br/>
altered in form by the wind and waves, so that vessels are liable<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>long detention in the open roads. Under the most favourable<br/>
circumstances <span style="color: #ff0000;">thenavigable </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">channel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">varies </span>from 6 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">left</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in depth.<br/>
The industries to which the town was indebted for its former pros<br/>

find it interesting to visit one of the streets inhabited by the silk<br/>

<br/>
HISTORY. Little or nothing is known of the early history of Damietta.<br/>
It is mentioned by Stephanus of Byzantium as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tumiathia</span>, a name which<br/>
has been preserved in the Coptic <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tamt'att</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>. The town must, however, have<br/>
been <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>place of some importance during the Roman period, if we may<br/>
judge from the numerous and occasionally very handsome columns in<br/>
the mosques, many of which were found on the spot, though others were<br/>
brought by the Arabs by sea from Alexandria <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Pelusium. Domitian<br/>
seems either to have visited Damietta, or to have been one of its patrons,<br/>
as a stone bearing his name, doubtless found in the ancient town, now<br/>
stands in front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">kadis </span>house. At a later period there were probably <span style="color: #ff0000;">agood </span>many Christian residents, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>remarkably fine Christian<br/>
church, which was destroyed by the Crusaders, once stood in ancient<br/>
Damietta. During the Arabian era Damietta attained a great reputation<br/>
on account of the resistance it offered to the Crusaders; but the town of<br/>
that period stood farther to the N. than its modern successor <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see below).<br/>
It was besieged for the first time, but without success, about 1196 by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Amalarich </span>and the troops of Manuel, the Greek emperor. Saladin devoted<br/>
special attention to the fortification of the place. In 1218 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damietta </span>was<br/>
besieged by King John of Jerusalem with a German, Dutch, English, and<br/>
French army, under the generalship of the Count of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Saarbruck</span>, aided by<br/>
the knights of three ecclesiastical orders. The Christian army, which<br/>
was afterwards reinforced by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>number of Italian troops, is said to have<br/>
consisted of 70,000 cavalry and 40,000 infantry, and although this account<br/>
is probably much exaggerated, it was doubtless very numerous. With<br/>
the aid of an ingenious double boat, constructed and fortified in accordance with a design by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Oliverius</span>, an engineer of Cologne, the Frisians,<br/>
Germans, and others of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">besiegers </span>succeeded after a <span style="color: #0000FF;">light </span>of twentyfive hours in capturing the tower to which the chain stretched across<br/>
the river was attached. The success of the Christians was however considerably marred by the interference of the ambitious, though energetic<br/>
Pelagius Galvani, the papal legate, and by the vigilance of the Egyptian<br/>
prince Melik <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Kfuuil</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>1219 many pilgrims, including Leopold of<br/>
Austria, <span style="color: #0000FF;">quilted </span>the camp of the besiegers, believing that they had done<br/>
their duty. At length, after various vicissitudes, the Christians captured<br/>
the place. They obtained valuable spoil, sold the surviving <span style="color: #0000FF;">townspeople<br/>
</span>as slaves, and converted the mosques into churches<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1221 </span>they<br/>
were compelled by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>treaty to evacuate the town. In 1249, when Louis IX.<br/>
landed near Damietta, it was abandoned by its inhabitants, who had set<br/>
all the warehouses on fire<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Without </span>striking <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>blow, the Crusaders<br/>
marched into the deserted streets of the fortress, but in the course of<br/>
the following year they were obliged to restore it to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Saracens </span>as part<br/>
of the ransom of Louis <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN.</span>, who had been taken prisoner <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jrrvuyirrr<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">439 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>. During the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span>by a resolution of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Emirs</span>, the town<br/>
was destroyed, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-erected </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E. bank of the river, farther to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span>, on the site which it now occupies. The new town soon became an<br/>
important manufacturing and commercial place. Its staple products were<br/>
leather-wares, cloth, and essence <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">jasmine</span>, for which it was famous,<br/>
and its harbour was visited by ships of many <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>nations. After<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammad </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iAli</span>'s victory over the Turks at Damietta in 1803, he constructed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nahmddiyeh </span>Canal with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>to restore Alexandria<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s </span>ancient importance. Damietta thus lost most of its trade, and its decline<br/>
was farther accelerated by the foundation of the ports on the Suez Canal<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
