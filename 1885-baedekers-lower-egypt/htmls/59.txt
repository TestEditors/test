Vince of Bahr <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Abyad</span>, where in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of the Shilluk tribe,<br/>
numbering about one million souls, the proportion of inhabitants<br/>
to the square mile is the same as in Egypt proper. The total population of the empire, including <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fur </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilarar</span>, is now estimated at between 16 and 17 millions.<br/>
<br/>
Origin and Descent of the Egyptians. For thousands of years<br/>
the banks of the Nile have been occupied by the Egyptians, the<br/>
oldest nation known to history, and still exhibiting many of their<br/>
ancient personal characteristics unaltered. Notwithstanding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">interminable </span>series of <span style="color: #0000FF;">immigration </span>and other changes affecting the<br/>
character of the inhabitants, the Egyptian type has always predominated with marvellous uniformity. As Egypt is said to be the<br/>
'gift of the Nile', so has the character of its inhabitants been apparently moulded by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">influences </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthat </span>river. No country in<br/>
the world is so dependent on a river which traverses it as Egypt,<br/>
and no river presents physical characteristics so exceptional as the<br/>
Nile; so, too, there exists no race of people which possesses so<br/>
marked and unchanging an individuality as the Egyptians. It is<br/>
therefore most probable that this <span style="color: #0000FF;">unvarying </span>type is the product of<br/>
the soil itself, and that the character of the peoples who settled at<br/>
different periods on the bank of the Nile, whatever it may originally have been, has in due course of time been moulded to the<br/>
same constant form by the mysterious <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>of the river. In<br/>
all countries, indeed, national characteristics are justly regarded<br/>
as the natural outcome <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>soil and climate, and of this connection<br/>
no country affords so strong an illustration as Egypt, with its sharply<br/>
defined boundaries of sea and desert, and in its complete isolation<br/>
from the rest of the world. These considerations tend to throw<br/>
serious doubts on all the current theories as to the origin of the<br/>
Egyptians. According to the Bible, <span style="color: #ff0000;">MizraimO'Iisraim </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>was the son<br/>
of Ham and brother of Canaan and the Ethiopian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cash</span>; and, as his<br/>
name was applied by the Hebrews to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>, it is probable that he<br/>
migrated with his sons from Asia to the banks ofthe Nile. The name,<br/>
moreover, of Ludim, his eldest son, corresponds to the word <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rotu</span>,<br/>
or Lotu, the hieroglyphic name for the Egyptians. Philologists,<br/>
who have discovered points of resemblance in the roots and <span style="color: #0000FF;">inflections </span>of the ancient Egyptian and the Semitic <span style="color: #0000FF;">languages</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>likewise<br/>
come to the conclusion that the Egyptians originally came from<br/>
Asia, either by way <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofSuez</span>, or across the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea from Arabia. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ethnographeri</span>, on the other hand, who observes that many of the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>No inference can legitimately be drawn from the fact that the<br/>
skulls of the ancient and modern Egyptians, which are very similar in<br/>
form, have no affinity with those which are usually described as of the<br/>
negro type, as our <span style="color: #0000FF;">craniological </span>collections are very incomplete, and our<br/>
knowledge of the negro races imperfect. The fact is, that several negro<br/>
races, such as the Nubians and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shilluk</span>, might be named, whose<br/>
characteristics undoubtedly belong to the negro type, while their skulls<br/>
are just as little <span style="color: #0000FF;">prognathous </span>as those of the Egyptians<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
