<span>to Sinai. PLAIN OF <span style="color: #ff0000;">ER-RKHA</span>. 10. Route. 513<br/>
<br/>
This point commands an admirable survey of the broad <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi</span>, which<br/>
is believed by many to have been the <span style="color: #0000FF;">camping</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>of the Jews,<br/>
and is <span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesquely </span>enclosed by huge mountains of granite.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite the cliffs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fi.jafs.sitf</span>, on the other side of the valley,<br/>
rise the red porphyry masses <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Jebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fré'a</span>, forming the nucleus<br/>
of a labyrinth of other mountains extending towards the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>S. side<br/>
of it is called the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">39214</span>, to which belong the granite slopes commanding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dei </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er-thhn</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>at the traveller's feet and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mr2di </span>ed-Dér.<br/>
On the right (E.) rises the Jebel ed-De'r, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the left (<span style="color: #0000FF;">W.</span>) are seen<br/>
numerous cliffs of granite, including the narrow <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ughret </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Jfehd </span>at the<br/>
entrance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>Leja, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Glzabsheh</span>. Far below us in<br/>
the valley, at the mouth of the ravine above which we stand, rises a<br/>
mound of sand with some ruined buildings and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few fruit-trees.<br/>
<br/>
The Plain of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Er-Rii.ha</span>, Which <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>here survey, is, according to<br/>
the measurements of Prof. Palmer, two million sq. yds. in area.<br/>
There is no doubt that this valley is <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>extensive to have<br/>
been the <span style="color: #0000FF;">camping-place </span>of a large multitude like that of the<br/>
Israelites. If the Mt. Sinai of the monks, and not Mt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbil</span>, is to<br/>
be regarded as the mountain where the commandments were given,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ris </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es.-Yfs.if</span>, and not the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mtasa</span>, must have been the peak<br/>
ascended by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moses</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>If the Jebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mfisa </span>alone has been climbed,<br/>
and the traveller <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wishes </span>afterwards to visit the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rzis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es-Safsaf</span>, he<br/>
should ascend with a guide through a cleft immediately behind the<br/>
monastery, a little to the W. of the pilgrims' steps. There are steps<br/>
here also, but the route is not recommended to those who are <span style="color: #0000FF;">inclined </span>to dizziness, and it is much more fatiguing than the pilgrims'<br/>
route. The descent may be made by a cleft opening into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Babe<br/>
</span>plain, but this route is also very rough, and cannot be recommended<br/>
for the ascent. Huge masses of rock have fallen into the cleft, and<br/>
the path often leads below them.<br/>
<br/>
Those who desire to compare the form of the group <span style="color: #0000FF;">amt</span>. Sinai with<br/>
the account given of the'Mount of the Lord<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>in the Bible narrative should<br/>
keep in mind the following points suggested by Dr. Robinson, which may<br/>
also be considered in reference to Mt. Sinai. There must be the summit<br/>
of a mountain commanding the camp of the people, and a space <span style="color: #0000FF;">contiguous </span>to the mountain from which a large multitude could witness<br/>
the scene on the heights. The camping-place must be so situated with<br/>
regard to the mountain, that the people could approach the latter, and<br/>
stand upon its lower slopes; there must <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>the possibility <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">touching </span>the<br/>
mountain, and of placing an enclosure round it to prevent the people<br/>
from ascending it, or touching its extremity.<br/>
<br/>
Those <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wish </span>to return hence to the monastery, and not to<br/>
visit the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>Leja and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">El</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arba'in </span>monastery (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">514 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>at<br/>
present, may descend by the ravine called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sikkct </span>Shu'aib. The<br/>
route is difficult<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and reminds one of the question asked by Recha<br/>
of the Knight Templar in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lessing's'Nathan</span>', whether'it was really<br/>
so much easier to ascend the mountain than to descend it'.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">al-Lajn </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Arba'in </span>Monastery may be reached<br/>
even on horseback and <span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>a guide. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>excursion,<br/>
which presents no <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties</span>, takes 4 hrs.; numerous sacred spots<br/>
are pointed out on the route. Before entering the valley from the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Babe </span>plain, the place is shown where the earth is supposed to have<br/>
