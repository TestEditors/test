of every new prelate. After a lapse of 112 years a new archbishop (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kant</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mam</span>) was installed in the monastery in 1872, but his election was <span style="color: #0000FF;">attended </span>with great difficulties. If the quaint old writer Schiltberger of<br/>
Munich (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1394-1427</span>) could have <span style="color: #ff0000;">foreseen </span>these modern events, he would<br/>
hardly have recorded the following <span style="color: #0000FF;">miracle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'A </span>great wonder takes<br/>
place in the monastery, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>there are many monks, who have as many<br/>
lamps, which are always burning. And when a monk is about to die<br/>
his lamp begins to wane, and when it goes out, he dies. And when th,<br/>
Abbot dies, the monk, who sings his praise after the mass, finds on the<br/>
altar a letter on which is written the name of the man who is to he<br/>
Abbot. And the lamp of the dead Abbot thereupon lights itself.' The<br/>
absent archbishop is represented by a prior or <span style="color: #ff0000;">wekil</span>, but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">estate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
</span>the monastery are actually managed by an intendant. Most of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">monksf<br/>
</span>who are quite uneducated, practise some handicraft; and they are most,<br/>
successful in the distilling of brandy, and in gardening. Among them<br/>
are also a tailor and a shoemaker who charge exorbitantly for their<br/>
primitive <span style="color: #0000FF;">workmanship </span>The bread of coarse flour is also baked on the<br/>
premises. Many of the monks spend a few years only on Mt. Sinai, after<br/>
which they return home as'martyrs'. The monastery is also considered<br/>
as a kind of penal establishment. The healthy mountain air enjoyed by<br/>
the inmates of the monastery of St. Catharine has always contributed greatly to their longevity, but most of them <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffer </span>from rheumatism.<br/>
<br/>
The Monastery of Sinai, an irregular pile of buildings, lies<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">5014ft</span>. above the sea-level, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>granite slopes of the Jebel<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mrisa </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mount </span>Sinai, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span>Shu'aib or valley of Jethro.<br/>
Into the outer wall, facing the garden, are built two fragments of<br/>
marble bearing inscriptions, one in Greek, and one in Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>published by Lepsius). They both date from the 12th or 13th century,<br/>
and are to the same effect<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Thelonger</span>, in Arabic, runs as follows :<span style="color: #0000FF;">-'The </span>monastery of Mt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tor</span>) Sinai, and the church of the Mountain<br/>
of the Conversation, was built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Justianus </span>(i. e. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Justinianus</span>), the<br/>
pious king of the Greek confession, dependent on the aid of God,<br/>
and waiting for the promise of his Lord, to remind himself and his<br/>
wife Theodora of the flight of time, in order that God might inherit the earth and everyone thereon, for he is the best of heirs.<br/>
And his building was ended after thirty years of his reign; and he<br/>
appointed over it a <span style="color: #0000FF;">superintendent </span>named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dhulas</span>. And this<br/>
happened in the year <span style="color: #0000FF;">6021 </span>after Adam, which corresponds with<br/>
the year <span style="color: #0000FF;">527 </span>of the year of the Lord Christ'. It appears from the<br/>
style of the characters, that the inscriptions date from the 12th or<br/>
13th cent, and it has already been mentioned, that the date of the<br/>
foundation of the monastery has been confounded with that of the<br/>
castle built by Justinian. The same <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">contain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>another large<br/>
stone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, to judge from its ornamentation, probably bears a<br/>
third inscription on one of its sides. The monastery was often<br/>
destroyed and rebuilt, and consequently exhibits great <span style="color: #0000FF;">incongruity<br/>
</span>of form; we therefore find cubes and round arches, pointed and flat<br/>
roofs, and a church and mosque in close contact with each other.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>building presents the appearance of a fortress externally, but the bold and menacing defences consist of the walls of<br/>
houses, and massive walls of stones connecting the different buildings, which take the place of a regular rampart. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">apartments<br/>
