night), a thriving, semi-European town, lies <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>branch <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>freshwater canal (seeabove) and on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maize </span>Canal (the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tanite<br/>
</span>arm of the Nile, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">438 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. It is the capital of the E. province of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sherlciych </span>and seat of a mudir, and is said to contain about 40,000<br/>
inhabitants.<br/>
<br/>
The situation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zakazik</span>, in the midst of a fertile tract watered<br/>
by several canals, and connected with the richest districts of the<br/>
Delta, is extremely favourable, and it is a rapidly improving place.<br/>
The soil here has been very carefully cultivated since the time of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli </span>(1826), and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zalrizilr </span>forms the chief centre of the<br/>
Egyptian cotton and grain trade. No less than 50,000 tons of<br/>
cotton are said to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>sold here annually. During the American war<br/>
the production of cotton in this district was carried to such an extent as to threaten all other branches of agriculture with extinction,<br/>
but a just equilibrium has fortunately been again restored. Many<br/>
European merchants have <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices </span>here, and the large <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">factories<br/>
</span>give the place an almost European appearance. <span style="color: #0000FF;">7.3mm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>is also<br/>
important as a railway <span style="color: #0000FF;">junction.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the vicinity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rear </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tell </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Basta</span>,<br/>
lay the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Bubastus (Egyptian Pi-bast; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pibesetk </span>of Ezekiel xxx<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">17</span>), the capital of the Bubastite nome (p. 91).<br/>
<br/>
The ruins of the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis </span>consist of large and dark <span style="color: #0000FF;">mounds<br/>
</span>of debris, visible from the railway, and situated <span style="color: #ff0000;">3/</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>M. from the station;<br/>
but the place is uninteresting except to those who endeavour to identify<br/>
these shapeless remains with the description given by Herodotus (ii. 137,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">156</span>) of the town and temple of the Egyptian Artemis (Sekhet, Bast, or<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pasht</span>). The site was <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-discovered </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mains</span>. Wherever an ancient<br/>
Egyptian town has stood, there are always to be found mounds of<br/>
earth, rubbish, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">potsherds</span>, which the Arabs <span style="color: #ff0000;">call'Kdm</span>'. These mounds<br/>
here are of unusual height, recalling the account of the place given by<br/>
Herodotus. He informs us that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sabaco</span>, an Ethiopian monarch, who<br/>
reigned for 50 years, never caused criminals to be executed, but sent<br/>
them back to their native places for the purpose of heaping up rubbish<br/>
to raise the height of the sites (which had already been done in the<br/>
reign of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>. The town of Bubastis in particular, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>contained the beautiful temple of Bubastis, seems to have been specially<br/>
favoured in this respect, so that, if the story is true, the inhabitants<br/>
must often have been getting into trouble. It is these mounds which are<br/>
visible from the railway, but the'notable temple', of which Herodotus<br/>
says <span style="color: #0000FF;">that'there </span>are many larger and more costly, but none equal to it<br/>
for beauty of <span style="color: #0000FF;">form</span>', has entirely disappeared. It was situated on an island, which was connected with the mainland by one approach opposite<br/>
the entrance to the temple, and formed by two <span style="color: #0000FF;">meets </span>conducted from<br/>
the Nile. Each moat <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>100 ft. in width, and bordered with trees<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'As<br/>
</span>the temple stands in the centre of the town<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, says Herodotus,'it may be<br/>
seen from every direction, and, as it remained unaltered when the site<br/>
of the town was raised, the spectator overlooks it wherever he may<br/>
happen to be<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A wall with raised <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-work </span>surrounds it, and another<br/>
encloses both the temple<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>containing the image of the goddess, and a grove<br/>
of trees of <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerable </span>height. The temple is a stadium in length, and<br/>
the same in <span style="color: #0000FF;">width </span>From its entrance runs a paved road, three stadia<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>length and <span style="color: #0000FF;">400</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in width, towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">... </span>across the <span style="color: #0000FF;">market-place</span>,<br/>
and straight <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>the temple of Hermes. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>each side of it rise <span style="color: #0000FF;">gigantic<br/>
