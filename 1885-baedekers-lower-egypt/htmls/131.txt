cabinet, the soul of which was Arabi Bey, the energetic minister of war, at once proceeded, without receiving the consent of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>, to pass several measures intended to<br/>
diminish the European influence in the political and <span style="color: #0000FF;">financial </span>administration of the country. The consuls general<br/>
were assured that no danger threatened the Europeans, but<br/>
were also told that any foreign intervention in the internal<br/>
affairs of Egypt would be resisted by force. The Khedive,<br/>
to whom both France and England had promised protection,<br/>
declared that he would offer a determined resistance to the<br/>
measures of the cabinet. At the end of May the British and<br/>
French fleets made their appearance before Alexandria. In<br/>
the middle of June serious disturbances broke out in that<br/>
town, in the course of which many Europeans were killed,<br/>
while the others found refuge on board the ships. On July<br/>
11th and 12th Alexandria was bombarded by the British<br/>
fleet, and on Sept. 13th the fortified camp of Arabi at Tell<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">el</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kebir </span>was stormed by a British force under Sir Garnet<br/>
Wolseley. Arabi and his associates were captured and sent<br/>
as exiles to Ceylon. Since these events English <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence<br/>
</span>has been paramount in Egypt. In the autumn of 1883 a<br/>
wide-spread rebellion broke out among the Nubian tribes<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stdin </span>under the leadership of Mohammed Ahmed,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called'Mahdi</span>' (p. 153), which threatened to be fatal<br/>
to the Egyptian supremacy in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sfidau</span>. An Egyptian<br/>
army of 10,000 men under an Englishman named Hicks<br/>
Pasha was annihilated in Nov., 1883, by the Mahdi's forces,<br/>
and a second expedition of 3500 regular <span style="color: #0000FF;">troops </span>of the Egyptian army, led by Baker Pasha, was also completely defeated<br/>
at Tokar in February, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1884</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the 18th of the same month<br/>
General Gordon, after a perilous ride across the desert, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ontered </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartfim</span>, which he had <span style="color: #ff0000;">uutertaken </span>to save from the<br/>
Mahdi; while on Mar. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ist </span>and Mar. 13th the rebel tribes<br/>
under the Mahdi's lieutenant Osman Digna were defeated at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Teb </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tamanieb </span>by the British troops under Graham.<br/>
The Mahdi himself, however, still <span style="color: #0000FF;">maintained </span>his position<br/>
near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartfim</span>, and towards the close of the year a second<br/>
British expedition (of 7000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">men</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>was sent out under Wolseley to rescue Gordon.<br/>
<br/>
Wolseley selected the Nile route for this expedition in<br/>
preference to the shorter but more dangerous desert route<br/>
from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Souakin </span>to Berber, but the ascent of the river proved<br/>
a very tedious <span style="color: #0000FF;">operation </span>and it was not till the beginning of<br/>
1885 that he was able to concentrate his troops at Korti,<br/>
between the third and fourth cataracts <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>a little above <span style="color: #ff0000;">EdDabbe </span>on the Map at p. 30). The Nile here makes an enormous bend, and a detachment of 1500 men was now sent <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
