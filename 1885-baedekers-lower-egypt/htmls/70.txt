<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'13 </span>THE MODERN <span style="color: #0000FF;">EGYPTIAN-5</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dweller-sin </span>Towns.<br/>
<br/>
of that race, they have entirely lost all its nobler characteristics in<br/>
consequence of their intercourse with strangers and their <span style="color: #ff0000;">dehasing<br/>
</span>occupations. Genuine <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>are to be found nowhere except in<br/>
their desert home, where to a great extent they still <span style="color: #ff0000;">retainthe </span>spirit<br/>
of independence, the courage, and the restlessness of their ancestors.<br/>
As in the time of Herodotus, the tent of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bcduin </span>is still his<br/>
home. Where itis pitched is a matter of indifference to him, if<br/>
only the pegs which secure it be firmly driven into the earth, if it<br/>
shelter his wife and child from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">burning </span>sunshine and the chilly<br/>
night air, and if <span style="color: #0000FF;">pasturage-ground </span>and a spring <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">within </span>reach. In<br/>
consequence of the frequent wars waged between the different<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tribes</span>, every Beduin is a warrior. Most of <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span>, too, as might be<br/>
expected, are extremely poor. Thus at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramleh </span>on the coast, near<br/>
Alexandria, the traveller will have an opportunity of seeing <span style="color: #ff0000;">awhole<br/>
</span>colony of the poorest class <span style="color: #ff0000;">eneamped </span>in their tents, where they<br/>
live in the most frugal possible manner, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a few miserable goats<br/>
and the fowls which subsist on the rubbish in their neighbourhood.<br/>
Though <span style="color: #ff0000;">profeSSors </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam</span>, they are considerably less strict in<br/>
their <span style="color: #ff0000;">observances </span>than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellahiu </span>of the valley of the Nile, who<br/>
are themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>lax, and above all they sadly neglect<br/>
the religious duty of cleanliness. They do not observe the practice<br/>
of praying <span style="color: #ff0000;">live </span>times a <span style="color: #0000FF;">day</span>, and they are <span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>a rule but slightly <span style="color: #0000FF;">acquainted </span>with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Relics </span>of their old star-worship can still<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>traced among their customs.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller will <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>observe <span style="color: #ff0000;">lieduins </span>in the bazaars<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the armourers and <span style="color: #0000FF;">leather</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">merchants</span>, and will be struck with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>proud and manly bearing of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">bronzed </span>children of the desert,<br/>
whose sharp, bearded features and <span style="color: #ff0000;">steady </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gaze </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hetokon </span>firmness and<br/>
resolution. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>Egypt the traveller need not fear their predatory<br/>
propensities, but they have frequently attacked travellers in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turkish </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tripolitania </span>and in the eastern part of Arabia <span style="color: #ff0000;">Petrzea</span>.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">4 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">ArtanIAN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">DwnLLnRs </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IN </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Towns</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'l'hose </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabs </span>with whom the<br/>
traveller usually comes in contact in towns <span style="color: #ff0000;">are </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">shepkecpers</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">officials</span>,<br/>
servants, <span style="color: #0000FF;">coachmen</span>, and donkey-attendants, or perhaps these last<br/>
only, as most of the best shops are kept <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Europeans, while in <span style="color: #ff0000;">offlcial </span>and legal matters his intercourse with the natives is carried<br/>
on through the medium of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">consul</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">indolence </span>and duplicity<br/>
of these Arabs, which proceed to some extent from the character of<br/>
their religion, have often been justly condemned, while <span style="color: #ff0000;">theirintelligrence</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">patience</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">amiability </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>too often ignored. They are<br/>
generally of a much more mixed origin than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>, as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">various </span>conquerors of Egypt usually made the towns their headquarters. Alexandria, for example, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>favoured by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Franks </span>and Arabs, and Cairo by the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Turks</span>. It thus happens that the citizens of the Egyptian towns consist of persons of<br/>
every <span style="color: #0000FF;">complexion </span>from dark brown to white, with the features of<br/>
the worshippers of Osiris or the sharp profile of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lieduins</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
