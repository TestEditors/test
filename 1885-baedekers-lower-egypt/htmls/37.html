Does, being regarded by the Muslims as unclean <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>79), are<br/>
never touched by them. Their barking is sometimes a source of<br/>
alarm, especially in country places, but they fortunately never bite.<br/>
As they are never domesticated in Oriental countries, it is quite<br/>
useless to attempt to establish friendly relations with them.<br/>

HOTELS. The traveller will find good, <span style="color: #0000FF;">first</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">class </span>hotels at<br/>
Alexandria, Cairo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'iliya</span>, Port Sa'id, and Suez, kept by Germans,<br/>
Frenchmen, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creeks</span>, with European waiters. The charges are<br/>
generally high, 15-25 fr. per day being charged during the season<br/>
for board, lodging, and attendance, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whether </span>all the meals are<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">partaken </span>of or not. For a prolonged stay a lower rate should be<br/>
stipulated for in advance. Wine is generally extra. The waiter<br/>
expects a fee <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2-3 </span>fr. per week, his native assistant <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/211</span>, and the<br/>
porter <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2 </span>fr.; for errands in the neighbourhood there is generally<br/>
a separate <span style="color: #0000FF;">tariff</span>. Orientals attract the attention of waiters by clapping<br/>
their hands, and sometimes with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">exclamation </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'yt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">weted</span>' (ho,<br/>

<br/>
HOSPITALITY. In all other parts of Egypt the traveller who is<br/>
not provided with tents must apply to the principal natives or<br/>
officials, or to European merchants for accommodation. The latter<br/>
are to be met with in every part of the Delta, and will be found<br/>
most courteous and hospitable. Letters of introduction may be obtained <span style="color: #0000FF;">Without </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>at Alexandria and Cairo.<br/>

EUROPEAN <span style="color: #0000FF;">GAMES </span>are to be found at the towns above mentioned,<br/>
beer being one of the refreshments they afford (1/2 fr. per glass).<br/>
The beer either comes from Vienna or Gratz, or is made in Cairo<br/>

smallest and dirtiest villages. In the country they usually consist<br/>
of wooden booths, with a few seats made of plaited <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-twigs<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">germ</span>), and even in the large towns, like Cairo, they are very small<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">uninviting</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">lgahwas </span>are frequented by the lower classes<br/>
exclusively. The front generally consists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">woodwork </span>with a few<br/>
open arches. Outside the door runs a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba</span>, or raised seat of<br/>
stone or brick, two or three feet in height and of about the same<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">width</span>, covered with mats, and there are similar seats on two or<br/>
three sides of the interior. Coffee is served by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lcahwegi </span>at 10<br/>
paras per cup (<span style="color: #ff0000;">fingdn</span>), and several <span style="color: #ff0000;">nargilehs </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">slotshehs </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">gfizehs<br/>
