but now built up, as it was in a dangerous condition. A little<br/>
beyond this point we reach the E. end of the main gallery (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">B</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Retracing </span>our steps for a short distance, we turn to the right, pass<br/>
over another sarcophagus which<br/>
blocks the way by means of steps,<br/>
and thus regain the door by which<br/>
we entered the vaults. The temperature in these subterranean<br/>
chambers, to which the outer air<br/>
has little or no access, is always<br/>
about <span style="color: #ff0000;">79</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, that being the mean<br/>
temperature of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairoi<br/>

</span>Before taking our leave of this<br/>
extraordinary place, we may quote<br/>

when I penetrated for the first time, on<br/>
12th Nov. 1851, into the Apis vaults, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I<br/>
</span>was so profoundly struck with <span style="color: #0000FF;">astonishment </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hat </span>the feeling is still fresh<br/>
in my mind, although five years have<br/>
elapsed since then. Owing to some<br/>
chance which it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to account<br/>
for, a chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>had been walled up in the thirtieth year of the<br/>
reign of Ramses II. had escaped the<br/>
notice of the plunderers of the vaults,<br/>
and I was so fortunate as to find it<br/>
untouched. Although 3700 years had<br/>
elapsed since it was closed, everything<br/>
in the chamber seemed to be precisely<br/>
in its original condition. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">huge </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">marks </span>of the Egyptian who had <span style="color: #0000FF;">inserted </span>the last stone in the wall built<br/>
to conceal the doorway were still recognisable on the lime. There were<br/>
also the marks of naked feet imprinted on the sand which lay in one <span style="color: #0000FF;">corner </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber</span>. Everything<br/>
was in its original condition in this<br/>
tomb, where the embalmed remains<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bull </span>had lain undisturbed for<br/>

<br/>
here alone in the desert for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">number<br/>
</span>of years; but <span style="color: #0000FF;">such </span>discoveries as that of the chamber of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pro<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">duce </span>impressions compared with which everything else sinks into <span style="color: #ff0000;">insrgnificance</span>, and which one constantly desires to renew<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
