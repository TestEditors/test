<span>256 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Route </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CAIRO</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rumors</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>I<br/>
<br/>
in the early Arabian <span style="color: #0000FF;">style</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>is a favourite subject with European<br/>
<br/>
artists.<br/>
<br/>
The prices of the carpets, like those of other Oriental goods, are<br/>
liable to great <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluctuation</span>. Those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baghdad </span>and Brussa (in Asia Minor)<br/>
are the most sought after, but imitations, manufactured at Brussels, are<br/>
said to be not uncommon. They are <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>remarkable for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">barmonious </span>arrangement of their colours. As soon as a purchaser appears,<br/>
the dealers spread their wares over the whole court for his inspection.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>the traveller is pressed for time he had better not attempt to make a<br/>
purchase, as several hours must not unfrequently be spent in <span style="color: #0000FF;">negociation<br/>
</span>before a satisfactory bargain is concluded.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving this court, we cross the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fihlli </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">en-Nahh√©sin </span>(see <span style="color: #0000FF;">below</span>)<br/>
in a somewhat oblique direction, and pass through a very <span style="color: #ff0000;">insigniticant </span>gate into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">St </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eigh </span>(pl. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siyttgh</span>), or bazaar of the gold<br/>
and silversmiths, which consists of several crooked lanes, barely a<br/>
yard in width, through which the traveller will sometimes find it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to thread his way. The occupants of these crowded alleys<br/>
keep their wares in glass cases or under glass shades. Their stalls<br/>
present a very poor appearance, but their <span style="color: #0000FF;">filagree-work </span>is sometimes very good. Spurious gold and silver wares are not unfrequently<br/>
sold as genuine. The bellows of the Silversmith are generally of<br/>
amusingly primitive construction, consisting of a conical bag of<br/>
goatskin, open at one end, where it is provided with wooden<br/>
handles, and terminating at the other end in a tube, usually an<br/>
old gun-barrel, which runs under a small mound of clay to the fire.<br/>
<br/>
The finest ninety-carat silver, which is never sold except in its native<br/>
condition, is frequently purchased with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>to the manufacture of plate<br/>
and trinkets in the house of the purchaser himself and under his immediate<br/>
supervision, in order that all <span style="color: #0000FF;">possibility </span>of fraud may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">obviated</span>. The<br/>
finest quality manufactured at the shops is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eighty-carat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">silver</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
workmanship bestowed on which is usually worth a quarter to <span style="color: #ff0000;">ahalftlle<br/>
</span>value of the raw material; the next quality is the seventy-five carat; and,<br/>
lastly, there are inferior qualities containing <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty </span>per <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>less of pure<br/>
silver. The silver manufactured at the shops ought to <span style="color: #ff0000;">bear </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">government </span>stamp, indicating the number of <span style="color: #ff0000;">carats </span>it contains. As soon as a<br/>
standard of price is agreed on, the article is paid for in accordance with<br/>
its <span style="color: #0000FF;">weight </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">dirhem </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tdrechms</span>), and with its assay as stated by the seller.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">.quality </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the metal is then attested by a government official, who<br/>
is always in attendance. and the article is taken to the customs-office,<br/>
where a duty is exacted from the purchaser. The whole transaction is<br/>
therefore of a somewhat complicated character, and the formal attestation by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">atl'ords </span>no guarantee whatever of the true quality of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>metal. The only satisfactory plan is to purchase the raw material,<br/>
and<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>like the natives of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Country </span>get it manufactured under <span style="color: #0000FF;">one's<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">persona </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Superv'sion</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In the Jewish quarter, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sill</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tigh</span>, are the booths<br/>
of the Jewellers <span style="color: #ff0000;">ftrt7haeyiyeh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, where, however, there is nothing to see, as<br/>
they show their wares to intending purchasers only.<br/>
<br/>
From this labyrinth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">lance </span>we return to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stilr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">en-Nahhasin</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>or market of the copper-smiths, immediately to the left of which<br/>
are the imposing facades of several contiguous mosques, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>two of which contain the tombs of Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jy'alafin </span>and his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammad </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cn-N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sir </span>(p. 277). This bazaar presents little attraction,<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
