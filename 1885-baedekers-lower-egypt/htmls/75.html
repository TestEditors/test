about as numerous as the last, and in some respects contrasts<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>with it. The Armenians generally possess excellent<br/>
abilities, and a singular aptitude for learning both Oriental and<br/>
European languages, which they often acquire with great grammatical accuracy. Many of them are wealthy goldsmiths and jewellers, and they often <span style="color: #0000FF;">hold </span>important government offices.<br/>
<br/>
The Jews are often distinguishable by their red hair from the<br/>
native Egyptians, as well as by other <span style="color: #0000FF;">characteristics </span>Most of them<br/>
are from Palestine, but many have recently immigrated from Wallachia. All the money-changers in the streets (<span style="color: #ff0000;">gur-rfif</span>), and many<br/>
of the wealthiest merchants of Egypt, are Jews, and notwithstanding the popular prejudice entertained against them, owing as is<br/>
alleged to their disregard of cleanliness, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>form, thanks to<br/>
the impartiality of the present government, one of the most highly<br/>

visitors in Egypt at the census of 1882 was 82,000, exclusive of<br/>
the British army of occupation. The Greeks are most <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerously<br/>
</span>represented, then the Italians, French, English (including Maltese),<br/>
Austrians (including many <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dalmatians</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, and Germans. The numerous Swiss residents in Egypt, who are not represented by a<br/>
consul of their own, are distributed among the above leading <span style="color: #0000FF;">classes </span>(French, Italian, <span style="color: #0000FF;">German </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>Beside these nationalities, there<br/>
are also a few representatives of Russia, America, Belgium, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Scandinavia</span>, and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">countries </span>Each of the above leading <span style="color: #0000FF;">nationalities </span>shows a preference for one or more particular occupations, in which they sometimes enjoy a complete monopoly. The<br/>
Greeks of all classes are generally traders. They constitute the <span style="color: #0000FF;">aristocracy </span>of Alexandria, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">victllal-dealers </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">ba.k.kdl</span>) in all the<br/>
other towns are mostly <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheeks</span>. They are the proprietors of the<br/>
numerous small banks which lend money on good security, both to<br/>
the peasantry and the government officials, at a rate of interest<br/>
sometimes amounting to <span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span>per cent monthly, the maximum <span style="color: #ff0000;">permittedby </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">law</span>; and they are the only Europeans who have established<br/>
themselves permanently as merchants beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confines </span>of Egypt<br/>
proper. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheeks </span>also have the unenviable notoriety of committing numerous murders, thefts, and other crimes, but it must<br/>
be <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>in mind that they are by far the most numerous section<br/>
of the European community <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>35,000 from Greece alone, besides<br/>
many Turkish subjects), and that some 30,000 of them belong to<br/>
the lowest class of emigrants from an unhappy and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ill-conditioned<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Many of these crimes must, moreover, be regarded as the<br/>
outcome of the sadly misdirected daring and ability which<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">characterise </span>their nation. The superiority of the Greeks to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
