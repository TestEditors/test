</span>to enjoy perfect repose for a short time. This interval of tranquil<br/>
enjoyment is the favourite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oriental'kilt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>(i. e. luxurious idleness).<br/>
Every <span style="color: #ff0000;">hath </span>contains a coffee and pipe establishment. Coffee and<br/>
hot eau <span style="color: #0000FF;">sucr√©e </span>are the favourite beverages. Before dressing, the<br/>
bather is generally provided with two or three more relays of fresh<br/>
towels, and thus the proceedings terminate. The whole of these<br/>
operations need not occupy much more than an hour, but Orientals<br/>
often devote a whole morning to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bath</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Many of the baths<br/>
are charitable foundations, where the natives pay little or nothing.<br/>
Europeans are generally expected to pay 8 piastres or more <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>including coffee and nargileh), and a fee of about 1 p. is given to the<br/>
'soap man<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>- A <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turkish </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bath </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">particularlyrefreshing </span>after a long<br/>
journey, and is an admirable preventive of colds and rheumatism,<br/>
<br/>
but if too often repeated sometimes occasions boils.<br/>
<br/>
'The women who can afford to do so visit the hammam frequently;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>not so often as the men. <span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>the bath is not hired for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">females </span>of one family, or for one party of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ladies </span>exclusively, women of all<br/>
conditions are admitted. In general all the females of a house, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">young </span>boys, go together. They take with them their own <span style="color: #ff0000;">seggadchs</span>, and<br/>
the napkins, basins, etc., which they require, and even the necessary<br/>
quantity of sweet water for washing with soap, and for drinking; and<br/>
some carry with them fruits, sweetmeats, and other refreshments. A lady<br/>
of wealth is also often accompanied by her own <span style="color: #0000FF;">bellu'nch </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mash'tah</span>,<br/>
who is the washer and tire-woman. Many women of the lower orders<br/>
wear no covering whatever in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bath</span>, not even <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>napkin round the<br/>
waist; others always wear the napkin and the high clogs. There are<br/>
few pleasures in which the women of Egypt delight so much as in the<br/>
visit to the bath, where they frequently have entertainments; and often,<br/>
on these occasions, they are not a little noisy in their mirth. They avail<br/>
themselves of the opportunity to display their jewels and their <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest<br/>
</span>clothes, and to enter into familiar conversation with those whom they<br/>
meet there, whether friends or strangers. Sometimes a mother chooses<br/>
a bride for her son from among the girls or women whom she chances<br/>
to see in the bath. On many occasions, as. for instance, in the case of<br/>
preparations for a marriage, the bath is hired for a select party, consisting of the women of two or more families, and none else are admitted; but it is more common for a lady and a few friends to hire a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">K'hilweh</span>: this is the name they give to the apartment of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hanafiyeh</span>.<br/>
There is more confusion among <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>mixed company of various ranks; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>where all are friends, the younger girls indulge in <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>mirth and<br/>
frolic. They spend an hour or more under the hands of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bellaneh</span>,<br/>
who rubs and washes them, plaits their hair, applies the depilatory,<br/>
etc. They then retire to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">beyt-owwal </span>0r <span style="color: #ff0000;">meslakh</span>, and there<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>having<br/>
put on part of their dress, or a large loose shirt, partake of various refreshments, which, <span style="color: #ff0000;">if </span>they have brought none with them, they may procure by sending an attendant of the bath to the market. Those who<br/>
smoke take their own pipes with them. On particular occasions of <span style="color: #0000FF;">festivity</span>, they are entertained with the songs of two or <span style="color: #ff0000;">more'Al'mehs</span>, hired<br/>
to accompany them to the bath.<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">LANE</span>.<br/>
