<br/>
</span>earth was then formed. In order to keep the earth steady, <span style="color: #0000FF;">G<br/>
</span>caused it to be supported by an angel, placed on a huge rock, which<br/>
in its turn rests on the back and horns of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>bull of the world.<br/>
And thus the earth is kept in its proper position.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">himultaneous </span>with the creation of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">firmament </span>was that of the<br/>
(min (demons), beings occupying a middle rank between men<br/>
and angels, some of them believing, others unbelieving. These<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">gin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>are frequently mentioned in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hora</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, and at a later period<br/>
numerous fables regarding them were invented. To this day the<br/>
belief in <span style="color: #0000FF;">them </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>general. When the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ginn </span>became arrogant, an<br/>
angel was ordered to banish them, and he accordingly drove them<br/>
to the mountains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">liit </span>by which the earth is surrounded, whence<br/>
they occasionally <span style="color: #0000FF;">make </span>incursions. Adam was then created, on the<br/>
evening of the sixth day, and the Muslims on that account observe<br/>
Friday as their Sabbath. After the creation of Adam came the fall<br/>
of the angel who conquered the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ginn</span>. As he refused to bow down<br/>
before Adam he was exiled, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">thenceforward </span>called <span style="color: #ff0000;">1am</span>, or the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">desil</span>. After this, Adam himself fell, and became a solitary wanderer, but was afterwards <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-united </span>to Eve at Mecca, where the<br/>
sacred stone in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">K </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a'ba </span>derives its <span style="color: #0000FF;">black </span>colour from Adam's tears.<br/>
At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jidda</span>, the harbour of Mecca, the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">live </span>is pointed out to<br/>
this day. Adam is regarded as the first orthodox <span style="color: #ff0000;">M </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">uslim</span>; for God,<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>earliest period, provided for a revelation.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Besides </span>the creative activity of God, his maintaining power is<br/>
specially <span style="color: #ff0000;">emphasised</span>, as being constantly employed for the preservation of the world. His instruments for this purpose are the<br/>
angels. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>the bearers of God's throne, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">execute </span>his<br/>
commands. They also act as mediators between God and men,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">being </span>the constant attendants of the latter. When a Muslim prays<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>he does after the supposed fashion of the angels in heaven)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>it will be observed that he <span style="color: #ff0000;">turnshis </span>face at the conclusion first over<br/>
his right and then over his left shoulder. He thereby greets the<br/>
recording angels who stand on each side of every believer, one on<br/>
the right to record his good, and one on the left to record his evil<br/>
deeds. The traveller will also observe the two stones placed over<br/>
every <span style="color: #ff0000;">graveiu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">alluslim </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">burial-ground</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>sit the two angels<br/>
who examine the deceased, and in order that the creed may not<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">escape </span>his memory it is incessantly chanted by the conductor of<br/>
the funeral.<br/>
<br/>
While there are legions of good angels, who differ in form, but<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>purely ethereal in substance<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>there are also innumerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">satelliti</span>'s of Satan, who seduce men to error and teach them sorcery.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'l'hey </span>endeavour to pry into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">seems </span>of heaven, to prevent <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>they <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>pelted with falling stars by the good angels. (This last is<br/>
a notion of very great <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
