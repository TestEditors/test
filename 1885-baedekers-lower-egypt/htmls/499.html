<span>PORT SA'ID. 7. Route. 437<br/>
<br/>
regular streets consist <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>of light and temporary brick <span style="color: #0000FF;">buildings</span>. The population <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>17,058, including 6000 Europeans) is similar<br/>
in character to that of Suez, but the French element preponderates<br/>
here still more. The construction of the harbour was attended<br/>
with immense <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty</span>. It occupies an area of 570 acres, and<br/>
has been excavated to a depth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>by means of laborious<br/>
dredging. It is protected by two massive piers; the eastern running out into the sea towards the N. for a distance of an English<br/>
mile; and the western, running towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.E</span>. for 11/2 M.,<br/>
being still <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span>. Where they start from the land these piers<br/>
are 1440 yds. apart, but their extremities approach within 770 yds.<br/>
of each other. The navigable entrance, marked by buoys which<br/>
are lighted at night, is only 100-100 yds. in width. (Those who<br/>
have leisure may hire a boat for a cruise in the harbour or for<br/>
the purpose of visiting one of the large steamers lying at anchor.)<br/>
The most serious risk to which the harbour is exposed is that of<br/>
being choked up with the Nile mud which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">deposited </span>on the<br/>
Pelusiac coast by a current in the Mediterranean, constantly flowing<br/>
from the west (comp. p. 207). The western pier is intended to<br/>
ward <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>these accumulations of sand and mud, and also to<br/>
shelter the harbour from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N.\\</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>. winds which prevail during<br/>
two-thirds of the year; and it is therefore of great length and solidity. Both piers were constructed by the Freres <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dussaud </span>of<br/>
blocks of artificial stone, manufactured of seven parts of sand from<br/>
the desert and one part of hydraulic lime imported from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ard√©che<br/>
</span>in France. The concrete was mixed by machinery and poured into<br/>
large wooden moulds, in which it remained for several weeks. The<br/>
moulds were then removed, and the blocks exposed to the air to<br/>
harden them more thoroughly. Each block <span style="color: #0000FF;">weighed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>tons, and<br/>
measured about 131/3 cubic yards in solid content. Thirty of them<br/>
were manufactured daily, and 25,000 in all were required.<br/>
<br/>
'Above the wooden moulds, which covered an extensive piece of<br/>
ground, was constructed a tramway, bearing a steam-crane, which could<br/>
be moved to any required spot, for the purpose of hoisting the blocks<br/>
and conveying them to their destination. After having been hoisted by<br/>
the crane, the blocks were transported to a boat, where they were placed<br/>
on an inclined plane in twos or threes, and secured by <span style="color: #0000FF;">menu </span>of wedges.<br/>
They were then conveyed to the place where they were to be sunk, the<br/>
wedges were removed, and the huge masses then slid down the <span style="color: #0000FF;">incline</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>splitting the wood and emitting sparks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>their way, and plunged<br/>
into the water with a tremendous splash, while the boat staggered from<br/>
the effects of the shock and was lashed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es </span>thus artificially<br/>
caused. These huge'pierres <span style="color: #0000FF;">perdues</span>', as they are technically called<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>were<br/>
thus gradually heaped up until they reached the <span style="color: #0000FF;">surface</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the last<br/>
layers, rising a little above the level of the water, were finally deposited<br/>
by means of a crane <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>board of a steamboat<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
On the strip of land separating Lake Menzaleh from the Mediterranean rises the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Liguhouse</span>, constructed of concrete, <span style="color: #0000FF;">16-1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in<br/>
height, and one of the largest in the world. Its electric lights are<br/>
visible to a distance of <span style="color: #ff0000;">24 </span>M. To the E. of it are quays and workshops. The streets extend along the W. side of the Inner Harbour<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
