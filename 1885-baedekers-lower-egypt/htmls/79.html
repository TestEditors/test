Egypt. The breadth of the cultivable alluvial soil corresponds with<br/>
the above varying width, but nowhere exceeds <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>miles. The soil<br/>
deposited by the Nile averages 33-38 ft. deep in Egypt, but near<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lgalyflb </span>at the head of the Delta it increases to about 50 ft., the<br/>
bottom of it being at places below the level of the sea. The bed of<br/>
the river is also of considerable depth, and at low water the mudbanks (gef) rise above its surface to a height of 25 ft. in Upper<br/>
Egypt, and 14 ft. at Cairo. These are also the depths of the various<br/>
irrigation wells.<br/>
<br/>
Throughout the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whale </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â© </span>of Egypt the Nile mud rests on a bed of <span style="color: #ff0000;">seasand</span>. The whole country between the first cataract and the Mediterranean was formerly a narrow estuary, which was probably filled by<br/>
degrees during the pleiocene period with lagoon deposits, washed down<br/>
from the crystalline Habesh. At a later period. when Egypt had risen<br/>
from the sea <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cand </span>after the isthmus had been formed), the river forced<br/>
its passage through these deposits of mud, sweeping away many of the<br/>
loose particles at one place and depositing them again farther down.<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Frans</span>) The Nile soil is unlike any other in the world in <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">composition</span>. According to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Regnault </span>it contains 63 per cent of water and sand,<br/>
18 per cent of carbonate of lime, 9 per cent of quartz, silica<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">felspar</span>,<br/>
hornblende, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">epidote</span>, 6 per cent of oxide of iron, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>per cent of<br/>
carbonate of magnesia.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing certain is known regarding the average increase of the<br/>
alluvial land, all the calculations regarding it having hitherto been<br/>
based on erroneous or insufficient data. Thus the Nilometer of<br/>
antiquity furnishes the depth relatively to the level of the sea, but<br/>
not absolutely. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">thickness </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofearth </span>accumulated around buildings<br/>
of known age has also been found a fallacious guide; and lastly<br/>
local measurements lead to no result, as the river often capriciously<br/>
washes away what it has deposited in previous years. An approximate calculation might possibly be made if the proportion of solid<br/>
matter annually brought down by the river could be ascertained,<br/>
but no investigation of this kind has ever been made. It has sometimes been asserted that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>desert has begun to <span style="color: #0000FF;">encroach </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the<br/>
cultivated part of the valley, but Sir G. Wilkinson has shown, that,<br/>
while the sand of the desert may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>advancing at places, the cultivable bed of the valley is steadily increasing in thickness and width.<br/>
<br/>
The INUNDATION, as is obvious from what has already been<br/>
said, is more or less favourable according to the greater or less<br/>
amount of rain that falls among the Abyssinian mountains, for<br/>
that which falls in Central Africa is a more constant quantity,<br/>
being regulated by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">trade-winds</span>. Like the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">waterspouts </span>which descend on equatorial Africa, the overflow always recurs at the same season of the year, varying in its advent<br/>
by a few days only, and in its depth by several yards. At the beginning of June the river slowly begins to swell, and between the<br/>
15th and 20th of July the increase becomes very rapid. Towards<br/>
the end <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">September </span>the water ceases to rise, remaining at the same<br/>
height for a fortnight or more, but during the first half of October<br/>
it rises again and attains its highest level (<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">939 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">After<br/>
