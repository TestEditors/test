<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>walking through the bazaars <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see below) and other streets,<br/>
the traveller will be interested in observing how industriously and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully </span>most of the artizans work with their very primitive tools.<br/>
The Carpenters <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nagyCtrj</span>, for example, seem to ply their craft with<br/>
very tolerable success, without bench, vice, rule, or drill. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>order to steady the piece of wood on which they are working they<br/>
make use of the weight of their bodies, and sometimes of their<br/>
teeth and their toes. For a rule they substitute a piece of string<br/>
or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-twig</span>, and for boring holes they use an iron spike<br/>
imbedded in a circular <span style="color: #0000FF;">piece </span>of wood, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they turn by means<br/>
of an instrument resembling a <span style="color: #ff0000;">fiddle</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bow </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">257</span>). Their principal<br/>
tool consists of a small axe, which serves many <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>purposes.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>number of other primitive tools are described at pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">256</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>After the closing of the shops in the evening it is customary<br/>
for the porters or watchmen to place their beds (<span style="color: #0000FF;">serir</span>) of <span style="color: #ff0000;">palmtwigs </span>outside the entrances, where they spend the night, thus<br/>
presenting a very curious and characteristic phase of Egyptian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">out-of-door </span>life.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bazaarsi </span>of Cairo (comp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">23</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">though </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inferior </span>to those<br/>
of Damascus and Constantinople, present to the European traveller<br/>
so many novel features, and so many interesting traits of Oriental<br/>
character, that he should endeavour to pay them repeated visits,<br/>
in order to become acquainted with their peculiarities.<br/>
<br/>
Most of the bazaars consist of narrow, and often dirty, lanes,<br/>
generally covered over with an awning to shade them from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun<br/>
</span>and flanked with rooms of various sizes, open <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards </span>the street,<br/>
and about 3 ft. above the level of the ground (comp<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>.<br/>
These lanes usually enclose a massive building of considerable size<br/>
(khan), consisting of two stories, and containing an inner court,<br/>
around which are grouped a number of magazines for goods. Some<br/>
of the older of these buildings, particularly those in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gameliyeh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>257) and the Khan <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Khalili </span>(p. 255), are architecturally <span style="color: #ff0000;">iuteresting</span>, and possess handsome <span style="color: #ff0000;">mushrebiychs</span>. A considerable<br/>
number of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">kh'aus </span>form separate quarters of the city (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">7<br/>
</span>which were formerly closed by massive, <span style="color: #0000FF;">iron-mounted </span>gates, still<br/>
in some cases preserved; and they were carefully guarded at night<br/>
by watchmen appointed for the purpose. No one was permitted <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
