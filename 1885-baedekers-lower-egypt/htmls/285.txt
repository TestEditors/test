Most <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>booksellers are also scholars, but they are not so fanatical<br/>
as their brethren of Damascus, who sometimes decline to sell their books<br/>
to Christians. Seated on their <span style="color: #ff0000;">niastabas </span>are frequently to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>found various other members of the learned, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">would-be </span>learned, world, who<br/>
spend whole days here in interminable colloquies. Some of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">booksellers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sell </span>those works only which they have themselves published,<br/>
while others keep an assortment of books from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">printing-less </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">13131531</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>and others (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">2911</span>). As the prices vary greatly in accordance with<br/>
the demand and other circumstances, and there is no such thing as a<br/>
fixed publishing price, purchasers should always endeavour to ascertain<br/>
beforehand the true value of any work they wish to buy. As in the<br/>
case of many other wares, the line between new and second-hand books<br/>
is not so strictly drawn in the East as in Europe. The booksellers generally keep catalogues, several feet in length, to refresh their memories<br/>
regarding the state of their stock. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran</span>, which is shown very <span style="color: #ff0000;">rm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lnctantly </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">non-Muslims</span>, is generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">kept </span>under lock and key, or at<br/>
least separate from the other books. The books are not arranged side<br/>
by side as in European shops, but piled up in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>very inconvenient fashion.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Many </span>of them are sold in loose <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheets</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in which case the purchaser<br/>
should see that the work is complete, as gaps are of frequent occurrence.<br/>
The bindings usually consist of leather and pasteboard. Valuable <span style="color: #0000FF;">books<br/>
</span>are often kept in cases of red sheepskin, out of which they are drawn by<br/>
means of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">loop</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The workmanship of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bookbinders</span>, who like other<br/>
Oriental <span style="color: #0000FF;">artisans </span>work in the open street, is generally cheap and durable.<br/>
Red is their favourite colour.<br/>
<br/>
At the point where the street expands a little, before reaching<br/>
the handsome W. entrance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Azhar </span>mosque (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">287</span>), we<br/>
observe several houses with picturesque <span style="color: #0000FF;">mushrebiyehs </span>(p. 181).<br/>
The next lane to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span>leads us across the Rue <span style="color: #0000FF;">Name</span>, the prolongation of the Muski (passing a large new school at the corner to<br/>
the right), towards the large new minaret of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llasan√©n </span>Mosque<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">2000</span>. Opposite to it, on the left, is a gateway through which<br/>
we enter the Khan el-Khalili (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1'1</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">0</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span>), which once formed the<br/>
centre of the commercial <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>of Cairo. This building, which is<br/>
said to have been founded so early as the end of the 13th cent. on<br/>
the site of ruined tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">El</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ashraf </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Salaheddin<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalil </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">1290</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">93</span>), one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tte </span>Mameluke sultans, forms a<br/>
distinct quarter of the city, and is intersected by a main street and<br/>
numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">cross</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lanes</span>, formed by long rows of stalls of tradesmen<br/>
and artizans, all covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">overt </span>This is the headquarters of the silk<br/>
and carpet merchants and the vendors of trinkets.<br/>
<br/>
The usual price of a light <span style="color: #0000FF;">kefl'iyeh </span>(shawl for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">head</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">12-14 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">re</span>,<br/>
and of one of heavier quality, with red and yellow stripes and interwoven<br/>
with gold thread, 20-25 fr. The fringes are generally loosened and<br/>
adjusted after the completion of the purchase. Many of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Damascene </span>silks, and particularly the lighter <span style="color: #ff0000;">kefTtyehs </span>in pleasing colours, are manufactured at Lyons and Crefeld. The table-covers of red,<br/>
blue, or black cloth, embroidered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">silk </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">35-100 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>), are well<br/>
worthy of notice. The letters with which they are adorned rarely have<br/>
any meaning.<br/>
<br/>
The Khan Khalili contains two large CARPET <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bananas</span>, one<br/>
(the smaller) immediately to the right of the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see above),<br/>
and the other at the W. end, to the left, a little before we reach<br/>
the broader and better lighted <span style="color: #0000FF;">Silk </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nahhasin </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">206</span>). The<br/>
latter of these two bazaars, established in the court of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">building<br/>
