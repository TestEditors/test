<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>temperature and character of these springs vary. They range<br/>
from 70° to <span style="color: #0000FF;">810 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fahm </span>and while some of them are quite drinkable and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>slightly brackish, others are very bitter and nauseous to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">taste<br/>
</span>The springs rise in the midst of gardens, where the natural hillocks have<br/>
been levelled, in funnel-shaped basins, within which the water wells<br/>
up from numerous small holes, and every new hole the visitor makes<br/>
with his stick becomes the source of a new spring. The natural<br/>
condition of the springs, however, is more satisfactorily observed in<br/>
the desert, outside of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">opuntia </span>enclosure. About a thousand paces<br/>
to the E. of the oasis stands a solitary palm, at the foot ofa hillock rising<br/>
about 16 ft. above the level of the plain. On the top of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">hillock </span>is a<br/>
pool, <span style="color: #ff0000;">4ft</span>. in diameter and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1yzft</span>. in depth. The water, <span style="color: #ff0000;">70</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>in temperature, is very salt and bitter, and the bottom of the pool is covered with<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">inky-black </span>mud. The discharge of the spring forms a stream <span style="color: #0000FF;">34 </span>inches<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">width</span>, which, however, is soon swallowed up by the desert sand at the<br/>
foot of the hill. Numerous water-beetles, which clung to the hand when<br/>
touched, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Melanin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fasciolata </span>Oliv. which seemed to luxuriate in the<br/>
tepid water, and, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>was much pleased to see, myriads of transparent<br/>
water-fleas (Cypris <span style="color: #ff0000;">deleeta </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Miill0 </span>disported themselves in the basin. In<br/>
the hollow of my hand I caught dozens of them, which swam about for<br/>
a time with their fringed feelers, and at length got ashore. I next observed <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the mud the innumerable transparent scales of dead insects,<br/>
and I at length discovered that the rock enclosing the hill was entirely<br/>
composed of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cypris </span>skins. It was now obvious that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cyprides </span>had<br/>
built the hill. Millions of these little insects had in the course of ages<br/>
cemented with their calcareous <span style="color: #0000FF;">integuments </span>the sand through which the<br/>
springs rise, thus at length forming a kind of wall around it; and when<br/>
the surface was in this way raised beyond the height to which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pressure </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">water </span>forced the <span style="color: #0000FF;">springs </span>some of them were entirely shut <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>and compelled to seek some other outlet.... The pressure of the<br/>
water evidently comes from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bahah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nits</span>, although they are <span style="color: #0000FF;">1014 </span>miles<br/>
distant.... Had it not been for this <span style="color: #0000FF;">organic </span>life, and particularly that<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cyprides</span>, which gradually walled in the channels of the springs<br/>
with their remains, so that the surface of the water is at some places<br/>
40-50ft. above the level of the desert, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">100m </span>above the level of the<br/>
sea, these waters would simply have been lost among the sands of the<br/>
desert.<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>. Frans.)<br/>

Ocean towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>, between Arabia and Africa, to a distance of<br/>

places 1000 fathoms in depth, but the shores are flanked with a network<br/>

from the coast. These reefs render the navigation of this sea very dangerous, particularly at the narrower parts of it, the most dreaded point<br/>
