<br/>
The Gebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">el</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ahmar</span>, or Red Mountain, which rises to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">iebel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Giyushi </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">335 </span>most conveniently visited <span style="color: #ff0000;">from'Abbitsiyeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">011 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-baek</span>; p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">332</span>), and connected with it by means of<br/>
a substratum of limestone, consists of a very hard <span style="color: #ff0000;">meioeene </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eonglomerate </span>of sand, pebbles, and fragments of fossil wood, cemented<br/>
together by means of silicic acid, and coloured <span style="color: #0000FF;">red </span>or yellowish<br/>
brown with oxide of iron. According to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frees</span>, the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>statues at Thebes are composed of rock from the'Red Mountain'. For<br/>
many centuries the quarries here have yielded excellent and durable millstones, and the neighbouring huge heaps of debris <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford<br/>
</span>abundant material for the construction of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">macadamised </span>roads<br/>
of Cairo and Alexandria. Similar <span style="color: #ff0000;">meiocene </span>formations, which owe<br/>
their origin to an eruption of hot springs impregnated with <span style="color: #0000FF;">silicic<br/>
</span>acid, occur to the S.E. of the Gebel el-Ahmar, in the direction of<br/>
the Petrified Forest, and even in a side-valley of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Giyfishi</span>.<br/>
A railway now encircles the whole of the hill, being used for carrying away the conglomerate and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">subjacent </span>limestone yielded by<br/>
its quarries. Messrs. Fraas and Unger have found a few examples<br/>
of freshwater conchylia among the fossils of the Gebel el-Ahmar.<br/>
<br/>
The Red Mountain undoubtedly owes its origin to an eruption of<br/>
silicic springs, which forced their way through the tertiary limestone<br/>
rock; and to similar agency is probably to be ascribed the mud-volcano<br/>
near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abfl </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Zn'bul</span>, beyond <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khfinhah</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">4-5 </span>hrs. to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>of this point. A<br/>
little to the E. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mid </span>Za'bel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the borders of the very smooth slope<br/>
of the sandy desert, protrudes a black basaltic tufa rock, which has not<br/>
reached the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-known </span>crystallised form of basalt, but is in an amorphous<br/>
condition, exactly resembling the black blocks lying <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E. side of the<br/>
Great Pyramid of Gizeh. As there are traces of very ancient quarries<br/>
near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ze'hel</span>, these blocks may possibly have been brought thence.<br/>
<br/>
Moses' Spring and the Petrified Forest.<br/>
<br/>
Since the time of the French expedition the'Petrified Forest near<br/>
Cairo', as part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gel</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>! <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khrtshab </span>is now called, has become one of the<br/>
sights of Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>almost every traveller makes a point of visiting.<br/>
To the natives the Petrified Forest is known as the'Great' and the'Little<br/>
Grebe ] <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khashab</span>'. The scientific traveller will find a visit to the former<br/>
extremely interesting, but most <span style="color: #0000FF;">travellers </span>will be satisfied with an excursion to the latter, the outskirts of which may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>reached in <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2 </span>hour.<br/>
The expedition may be made in half-a-day on donkey-back. Carriages<br/>
require extra horses, and even then sometimes stick in the sand.<br/>
<br/>
A few drops of bitter and brackish water which trickle from a cleft<br/>
in a narrow and rocky side-valley of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Molgattarn </span>are quite erroneously<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">um </span>Mam, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Noses</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">y</span>, but a visit to this spot (scarcely<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1/21</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>. from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">month </span>of the valley) is interesting, and may easily be<br/>
combined with the excursion to the Petrified Forest.<br/>
<br/>
The services of a guide may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>dispensed with, as every donkey-boy<br/>
is well acquainted with the route to the Little Petrified Forest, but a<br/>
visit to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Great</span>', near the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bit </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cl-Fahmeh</span>, can hardly be accomplished<br/>
without the aid of a well-informed <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bib </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nasir </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. B, 2; p. 280), we turn to the<br/>
right to the Tombs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khams</span>, pass close to the burial-mosque<br/>

limestone <span style="color: #0000FF;">substrate </span>of the'Red Mountain' (see above), cross a raised ledge of rock, forming a kind of threshold to the first desert<br/>
