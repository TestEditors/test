of taxation is not nearly so heavily felt here as in the valley of the<br/>
Nile the inhabitants are comparatively wealthy. Of late years, however, they have occasionally suffered from the predatory attacks of<br/>
nomadic marauders from the Cyrenaica, and even by the Arabs of the Nile<br/>
valley. A new disturbing element, too, has unfortunately sprung up<br/>
within the last ten years in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Siwa</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Bahriyeh, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Farafra</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in the establishment and rapid spread of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Semisi </span>order of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedans</span>, by whom<br/>
the introduction of all Christian culture is bitterly opposed. This religious order was founded about the middle of the present century by<br/>
Sidi <span style="color: #ff0000;">Snlisi </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sendsi</span>, as the name is pronounced in Eastern Africa<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>where<br/>
the vowels are more distinctly pronounced than by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moghrebhius </span>of<br/>
Algeria and Morocco), a <span style="color: #0000FF;">talib </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>scripture <span style="color: #0000FF;">scholar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>of Tlemsen in Algeria, for the purpose of restoring the observance of Islam to its original purity, and, above all, of warring against Christianity. Although the<br/>
members of the order are regarded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>Mohammedan sects as Khoms,<br/>
or heretics, they have rapidly acquired great power in the districts surrounding the eastern Sahara, and, like the Jesuits in Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">countries<br/>
</span>have amassed considerable wealth, their principal treasury being <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">brih</span>, the chief seat of the order<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>two days' journey to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>of Siwa.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sarabfib </span>is also the residence <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Sidi-Mahdi. the general of the order and<br/>
son of its founder, who has succeeded in obtaining certain privileges<br/>
from the Sultan of Turkey. At Siwa he has established a richly <span style="color: #0000FF;">outlawed<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yen</span>, or school of religion; <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">F. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eh </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">all-powerful</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>having within the ten years of its existence bought up a considerable<br/>
part of the landed property there; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Bahriyeh the order <span style="color: #0000FF;">11 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t.'Mu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.ceeded </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">inonopolising </span>the schools, <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>that the rising generation may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he<br/>
</span>expected to succumb to their influence. The hostility of this new sect<br/>
to all modern culture is obviously a serious obstacle to the progress<br/>
which the Egyptian government is now anxious to promote.<br/>
<br/>
Climate. The climate of Egypt is to some extent <span style="color: #0000FF;">influenced </span>by<br/>
the great artery on which the country's life depends, but the desert<br/>
may be regarded as its chief regulator. But for the immense <span style="color: #0000FF;">absorbing </span>power of the desert the winter rains of the Mediterranean<br/>
regions would extend far up the Nile valley; and, but for its proximity, the great expanse of nearly stagnant water at the mouths of<br/>
the Nile, covering an area of upwards <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2500 </span>sq. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M.</span>, would render<br/>
the Delta one of the most unhealthy and <span style="color: #0000FF;">uninhabitable </span>regions in<br/>
the world. The air of the desert is pleasantly cool, and possesses<br/>
the most refreshing and <span style="color: #0000FF;">health-giving </span>qualities; indeed, to borrow<br/>
Bayard Taylor's expression, it is a true'elixir <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">like</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>To the delicious purity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">airt </span>of the desert a kind of parallel is afforded<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>excellence of the water of the life-giving Nile.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">RAIN</span>, throughout a great part of Egypt proper, is a very rare<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">phenomenon </span>At Cairo the fogs of winter are rarely condensed into<br/>
showers of any duration, and the rain occasionally <span style="color: #0000FF;">blown </span>inland<br/>
from the sea seldom lasts long. Observations carried on at Cairo<br/>
for five years <span style="color: #0000FF;">show </span>a mean annual rainfall of <span style="color: #0000FF;">only </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2 </span>inch, while<br/>
the mean at Alexandria <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>a period of fourteen years was 8 inches.<br/>
The unusual frequency of rain during the last few years has been<br/>
absurdly attributed to the great increase of the area planted <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>It may <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>noticed here that the air is largely impregnated with<br/>
saline particles from the limestone rocks of the desert, and it is chiefly<br/>
to their presence that the beneficial <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>of the air on the respiratory<br/>
organs is supposed to be due.<br/>
