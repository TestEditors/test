masonry. No ancient inscriptions have been discovered here, but<br/>
the walls of some of the houses contain fragments which must<br/>
have belonged to ancient temples. At the W. end of the town the<br/>
Baht <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yfisuf </span>radiates into numerous branches, which water the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>every direction. The dilapidated mosque of <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>situated<br/>
here forms a picturesque foreground.<br/>
<br/>
To the N. of the town are the extensive ruins of <span style="color: #ff0000;">CrocodilopolisArsinoe</span>, which has been entirely destroyed. The site is now called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kthn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Firm</span>. Many antiquities, both <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Roman and the Christian<br/>
period, have been found here, including numerous small terracotta<br/>
lamps and many thousand fragments of papyri, intermixed with<br/>
pieces of parchment. Most of the papyri are Greek (among them<br/>
fragments of Homer, Euripides, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thucydides</span>, also of a Christian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">catechetical </span>book), many are Arabic from the 2nd cent. of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hegira </span>down to 943 <span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D.</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">others </span>are in Coptic, Pehlevi, Sassanide-Persian, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meroitic-Ethiopian </span>characters. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Several </span>fragments<br/>
in hieratic and hieroglyphic characters, the oldest from the time of<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>about 1300 13.0.), have also been discovered. As the<br/>
writings are for the most part <span style="color: #0000FF;">tax-papers</span>, it has been supposed that<br/>
they belonged to a tax office of the town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Crocodilopolis</span>, where<br/>
old papyri also were used. A large number of the papyri found<br/>
here were acquired by Consul Travers for the Berlin Museum<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and<br/>
even a larger number by Theod. Graf and Archduke Rainer for the<br/>
Austrian Museum of Art and Industry at Vienna. The very extensive cemetery of the town, with its picturesque tombstones, covers<br/>
part of the site of the ancient city; the highest of the mounds of<br/>
rubbish command a survey of the whole of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayfiin</span>. At the N.<br/>
end of the ruins, about 11/4 M. from Medineh, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1i</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Schweinfnrth<br/>
</span>discovered the remains of a large temple with a pylon, in front of<br/>
which is a sitting figure of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amellemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the founder of the 12th<br/>
Dyn., and inside several slabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the name of Ramses the Great.<br/>
A head <span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos </span>features, <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>in the museum of Gizeh, has<br/>
also been found here. According to Mr. Flinders Petrie, the temple<br/>
proper, which was 490 ft. wide and had a double <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade</span>, belongs to the 26th Dynasty.<br/>
<br/>

doubtless once situated on the bank of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lake </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Moeris</span>. It still contains<br/>
some <span style="color: #0000FF;">shapeless </span>ruins of ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">origin </span>destitute of inscription, but supposed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>the remains of the pyramids which according to Herodotus<br/>
once stood in the lake. They are now called Kursi <span style="color: #0000FF;">I'm-WM</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">chair </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Pharaoh, and resemble dilapidated altars rising above other fragments of<br/>
solid masonry. If they were <span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>pyramids, the greater part of them<br/>
must have been removed, as the walls are <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>but slightly inclined<br/>
inwards. Distinct traces of the water in which they once stood are to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>seen on their bases, and they are still surrounded by remains of<br/>
walls, the purpose of which is unknown.<br/>
