<span style="color: #ff0000;">reluctpf'y</span>, where the body is let down a perpendicular shaft to a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">spacious </span>vault excavated on one side of it, and there <span style="color: #0000FF;">plated </span>in<br/>
such a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pOsition </span>that its face is turned towards <span style="color: #0000FF;">lichen</span>. The entrance<br/>
to the lateral vault is then walled up, and during this long process<br/>
the mourners recite the <span style="color: #0000FF;">word </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-'AIM/ut </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">muyh/ir </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ct-muslimfn<br/>

</span>men and the Muslim women, the faithful men and the faithful<br/>
women). A <span style="color: #ff0000;">lilmtib</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">imam</span>, or other person then addresses a few<br/>
stereotyped words to the deceased<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>informing him how he is to<br/>
answer the two examining angels who are to question him during<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ensuing </span>night (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ici</span>). A <span style="color: #ff0000;">fitha </span>having again been whispered,<br/>
and the perpendicular shaft filled up, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the mourners incessantly<br/>
repeat the <span style="color: #0000FF;">words </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fbismithih </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-ralmair </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">raltmitni</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>in the name<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">God</span>, the merciful), the bystanders shake hands, and the male<br/>
mourners disperse. The women, however, who have stood a little<br/>
on one side during the ceremony, now come forward and inspect<br/>
the tomb.<br/>
<br/>
Another custom peculiar to the Muslims is that the separation<br/>
of the sexes is as strict after death as during life. In family vaults<br/>
one side is set apart for the men, the other for the women exclusively. <span style="color: #ff0000;">lletween </span>these vaults is the entrance to the tomb, which is<br/>
usually covered with a single large slab. The vaults are high enough<br/>
to admit of the deceased sitting upright in them when he is being<br/>
examined by the angels Munkar and Nekir on the first night after<br/>
his interment (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">155</span>); <span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>according to the belief of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedans</span>, the soul of the departed remains with his body for<br/>
a night after his burial. For particulars regarding the tombs, see<br/>
