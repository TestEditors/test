treasury and a selection of comparatively uninteresting modern<br/>
MSS. in a room adjoining the <span style="color: #0000FF;">archbishop</span>'s house. Implicit belief<br/>
should not be vouchsafed to all that the monks have to say about<br/>
the MSS. in the treasury. Thus, some loose pages of a Greek<br/>
Bible which they show do not belong, as they assert, to the Codex<br/>
Sinaiticus. The so-called Evangelium <span style="color: #ff0000;">Theodosiunum</span>, a collection of<br/>
passages from the New Testament, is described without any ground<br/>
whatever as a gift of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Plum</span>. Theodosius <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">766 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">An</span>), and in<br/>
all likelihood does not date farther back than 1000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">AD</span>. It is written on white parchment, both sides of each sheet having two columns<br/>
in golden characters. A kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">frontispiece </span>is formed by a series<br/>
of elaborate miniatures of Jesus, Mary, the four Evangelists, and<br/>
St. Peter. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psalteriunum </span>Cassianum, containing the whole<br/>
of the Psalms written in microscopical characters on six leaves, was<br/>
not executed by a nun of the 9th cent., named Cassia, but is a<br/>
piece of laborious trifling dating from the period of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Renaissance </span>.--In the'Small Library' is a copy of the famous Codex<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sinaiticus</span>, discovered by Prof. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tischendorf</span>, printed most carefully<br/>
from the original, and presented by the Emperor of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Russia</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Several </span>leaves of the precious MS. are preserved at the university of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Leipsic</span>, under the name of the'Codex Friderico-Augustanus', but<br/>
the greater part of it is at St. Petersburg, having been purchased<br/>
from the monastery by Alexander 11. for a large sum. The codex<br/>
contains a complete copy of the New Testament, most of the books<br/>
of the Old Testament, a part of the'Shepherd of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hermas</span>', and the<br/>
'Epistle of St. Barnabas'. The great value of the Codex Sinaiticus<br/>
is due to its completeness, the care with which it is written, the<br/>
consistency of the peculiarities of its text, and, above all, its great<br/>
antiquity. It is pretty well ascertained to date from about 400 A.D.,<br/>
and is surpassed by the celebrated Codex Vaticanus alone in age<br/>
and in importance in determining the Biblical text.<br/>
<br/>
On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>side of the monastery is the Burial Place of the<br/>
monks, reached by several dark passages, and consisting of a strongly<br/>
vaulted crypt. The remains of the bishops are <span style="color: #0000FF;">preserved </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins</span>,<br/>
and those of the priests in a separate part of the vault, while the<br/>
bones and skulls of the monks are merely piled up together. The<br/>
skeletons of several highly revered hermits are suspended from the<br/>
wall. At the gate of the priests' vault is placed the skeleton of<br/>
St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stephanos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cd</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">580</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, wearing a skull-cap of violet velvet. Not<br/>
far from this vault is a well, and beyond it is the rarely used <span style="color: #ff0000;">burialground </span>for pilgrims who have died here.<br/>
<br/>
A flight of steps descends from this court to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Gurdcn</span>, the<br/>
trees of which blossom most luxuriantly in March and April,<br/>
presenting a grateful sight in the midst of this rocky wilderness.<br/>
It is laid out in the form of terraces, and contains <span style="color: #0000FF;">peach</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">trees</span>,<br/>
orange-trees, vines, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, overshadowed by some lofty cypresses<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
