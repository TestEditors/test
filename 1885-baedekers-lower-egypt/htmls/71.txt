with the slender <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the fella ]; or the corpulence of the Turk.<br/>
Among the lower classes frequent intermarriage with negro women<br/>
has darkened the complexion and thickened the features of their<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offspring</span>; while the higher ranks, being descended from white<br/>
slaves or Turkish mothers, more <span style="color: #0000FF;">nearly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">resemble </span>the European type.<br/>
As the inhabitants of the towns could not be so much oppressed by<br/>
their rulers as the peasantry, we find that they exhibit a more independent spirit, greater enterprise, and a more cheerful disposition<br/>
than the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>. At the same time they are not free from the<br/>
dreamy character peculiar to Orientals, nor from a tinge of the apathy<br/>
of fatalism; and their <span style="color: #0000FF;">indolence </span>contrasts strongly with the industry<br/>
of their European rivals in political, <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific</span>, artistic, and all<br/>
business pursuits. A glance at the offices of the ministers, the<br/>
bazaars of the merchants, the schools of the Arabs, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">buildingyards </span>and workshops constructed by natives will enable the traveller<br/>
to observe <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>what deliberation and with what numerous intervals of repose they perform their tasks. From such workers it is<br/>
in vain to expect rapidity, punctuality, or work of a highly finished<br/>
character, and the caustic remark of Prince Napoleon that the Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">are'capable </span>of making a pair of pantaloons, but never of<br/>
sewing on the last button', was doubtless founded on experience.<br/>
The townspeople profess Islamism, but, in their youth particularly,<br/>
they are becoming more and more <span style="color: #0000FF;">lax </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>their obedience to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran</span>.<br/>
Thus the custom of praying in public, outside the house-doors and<br/>
shops, is gradually falling into disuse. The European dress, moreover, is gradually <span style="color: #0000FF;">superseding </span>the Oriental, though the latter is far<br/>
more picturesque, and better suited to the climate <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>On the whole,<br/>
however, they are bigoted Mohammedans, and share the contempt<br/>
with which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin </span>regard all other religions. Their daily intercourse with unbelievers and their dread of the power of the Christian nations tend, however, to keep their fanaticism, which otherwise<br/>
would be unbounded, in check, and has even induced them to admit<br/>
strangers to witness the most sacred ceremonies in their mosques.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>5). <span style="color: #0000FF;">BERBERS</span>. The name Berberi <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mam</span>) is believed<br/>
by many authorities to be identical with'barbarians', a word which<br/>
is said to have been adopted by the Greeks from the Egyptians, who<br/>
used it to denote all'non-Egyptians', and to be derived from brr,<br/>
i. e.'to be unable to speak', or'to speak imperfectly'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The'Bee<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bers</span>' of <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.Africa </span>and the town of'Berber' in S. Nubia also doubtless have the same origin. In Egypt the name is applied in a half<br/>
contemptuous way to the numerous immigrants from the Nubian<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>About the year 1865 a kind of uniform called <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Stambuliua</span>' was<br/>
prescribed by the government for all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>of the higher classes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>black <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a row of buttons and low upright collar), but they are<br/>
allowed to wear ordinary European clothing in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>. All the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">amends</span>, however, in the pay of the Egyptian government, including <span style="color: #0000FF;">Europeans</span>, and even the members of the mixed court of justice, must wear<br/>
the red fez (<span style="color: #ff0000;">tarhnsht<br/>
