<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">gham</span>, which deserve a visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P </span>hrs.<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>or, if a thorough inspection<br/>
is made, <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-a-day</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Mines of Maghara. The brown and <span style="color: #0000FF;">brick-red </span>slopes of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span>Maghara rise precipitously to a considerable height. They<br/>
belong partly to the sandstone, and partly to the granite formation.<br/>
The mines are situated on the slopes on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. side, about<br/>
145 ft. above the bottom of the valley. The traveller has to<br/>
scramble over heaps of rubble before reaching the broad but low<br/>
openings of the mines, which seem once to have been protected<br/>
by a gallery, now scarcely traceable. The shaft penetrates the rock<br/>
to a considerable depth, being very wide at first, but afterwards<br/>
contracting. Numerous pillars have been left for the support of<br/>
the roof; old chisel marks are still observable. At many places<br/>
the reddish stone contains small <span style="color: #0000FF;">bluish-green</span>, very impure turquoises, which may easily be detached with a penknife. These<br/>
stones lose their colour entirely after a few years. On the route to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wildi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Firan </span>(p. 494) the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Deduins </span>frequently offer for sale large,<br/>
but worthless, turquoises at exorbitant prices.<br/>
<br/>
Small pillars with hieroglyphic inscriptions still commemorate<br/>
the period when the mines were worked for the benefit of the<br/>
Pharaohs. On large smooth surfaces of the rocky walls these ancient<br/>
monarchs have handed down to posterity, by means of figures and<br/>
writing, the fact that they conquered the Mentu, who inhabited<br/>
these regions, and provided for the wants of their miners. A<br/>
gigantic Pharaoh is represented grasping the necks of a number of<br/>
the vanquished with one hand, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>with the other <span style="color: #ff0000;">heisbrandishing </span>a weapon (<span style="color: #ff0000;">khopshj</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Sacrifices are also represented, and festivals,<br/>
and a visit paid to the mines by inspectors of high rank. The oldest<br/>
king named here is Snefru (p. 523), the first king of the 4th Dynasty.<br/>
The next are Khufu <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Cheops, p. 86), the builder of the Great<br/>
Pyramid of Gizeh, another monarch of the 4th dynasty; Sahura,<br/>
Kaka, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Raeuuser7 </span>Menkauhor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tatkara </span>(Assa), of the 5th Dynasty;<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pepi-Merira </span>and Neferkara, of the 6th Dynasty (p. 87); Usertesen II. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, of the 12th Dynasty. During the<br/>
domination of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lkasos </span>the mines were neglected; but after their<br/>
expulsion, the working was resumed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasu</span>, the energetic sister<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">co</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">regent </span>of Thothmes 111., who has caused her ships, returning <span style="color: #0000FF;">richly-laden </span>from Arabia, to be represented at DÃ©r el-Bahri<br/>
(Thebes). There is also a pillar here dating from the time of<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, but no monument now exists of the reign of his son<br/>
Merenptah, the Pharaoh of the Exodus, nor of the later kings.<br/>
<br/>
The mineral obtained here is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mafkat </span>in the inscriptions. It<br/>
was of a decided green colour, and is elsewhere represented in bars of<br/>
this mm shape, and marked'genuine' to distinguish it from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'imitation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>. The results of the careful researches of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius </span>have also been<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>by Professor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Credner</span>'s geological investigations. The genuine<br/>
mafkat, which does not occur here, was probably the emerald, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while<br/>
</span>the inferior quality, which was often imitated, was malachite, verdigris,<br/>
green smelt, and the green colour prepared from the last. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">imitation<br/>
