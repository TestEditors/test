<br/>
Ra, is represented with the head of a crocodile, and was chiefly<br/>
revered in the region <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>cataracts <span style="color: #0000FF;">et </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Silsilil </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kém-Omhu</span>, and in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Faytm </span>(p. 457). At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kém-Onibu </span>Sebek forms a triad in conjunction with Hathor and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>. His crocodile head is crowned<br/>
with the disk, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uraeus </span>basilisks, and the double feather. He<br/>
grasps the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre </span>and the symbol of life in his hands, and is<br/>
coloured green. His sacred animal, the crocodile, was kept in<br/>
his honour, but a certain Typhonic character was attributed to the<br/>
reptile, as the sacred lists omit those <span style="color: #0000FF;">nomes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Where </span>it was worshipped.<br/>

other divinities were combined, and whose attributes were frequently<br/>
merged in those of Osiris, reigned, according to the later <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>, as the great monarch of the gods, but Ammon, who was<br/>
revealed to the exoterics as a son of Ptah, obtained possession of<br/>
the throne of this world, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>Ra continued his sovereignty in<br/>
Amenthes, or the nether regions. Ammon, whose name signifies<br/>
'the hidden one', is a deity of comparatively late origin, having<br/>
been at first merely the local god of Thebes; but after the valley<br/>
of the Nile had been delivered from the Hyksos under <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>auspices,<br/>
and after Upper Egypt and Thebes had gained the supremacy over<br/>
Lower Egypt and Memphis, he was raised to the rank of king of<br/>
all the gods. The attributes of almost the entire Pantheon of<br/>
Egypt were soon absorbed by this highly revered deity. He reposes<br/>
as a hidden power in Nun, or the primordial waters, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">during<br/>
