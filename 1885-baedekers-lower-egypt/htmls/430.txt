of <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>however, yielded interesting spoil <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the scientific <span style="color: #0000FF;">explorer</span>, and<br/>
copies were made <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>their monuments and decorations, but most of<br/>
them have again been covered up to preserve them from the influence of<br/>
the air and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rapacity </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">reli </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unters</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">so </span>that the visitor is now hardly<br/>
aware of their existence. The scientific traveller, however, may obtain<br/>
special permission from the museum authorities to unearth the interesting<br/>
tomb of Ptahhotep (p. 401), or any of the others.<br/>

The rocky margin of the plateau of the desert, between the village<br/>
of Abusir (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">370 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>and the road ascending from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salglgira</span>, contains <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>Tomb-Chambers (comp. p. 382), none of which now merit a visit,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">except </span>perhaps that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bekenrauf</span>, of the period of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psammetikb </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l. </span>The<br/>

dangerous. The whole of the soil of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis </span>is indeed so <span style="color: #ff0000;">honeycomhed </span>with tombs that great caution should be used in traversing it.<br/>
Some of the open shafts are no less than 50 ft. in depth.<br/>

'The traveller is lost in the immense<br/>
expanse of desert, which he sees full of<br/>
Pyramids before him; is struck with<br/>
terror at the unusual scene of vastness,<br/>
and shrinks from attempting any <span style="color: #0000FF;">discuvery </span>amidst the moving sands of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Saccara</span>.' Bruce.<br/>
<br/>
The Necropolis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sahlrara </span>[ from Sokar, p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">126</span>) extends over an<br/>
undulating tract of the desert, which, according to <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Mariette's<br/>
computation, is about 7700 yds. in length, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">550</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1600 </span>yds. in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">width </span>It contains sepulchral monuments of every kind, from the<br/>
pyramid to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-hewn </span>cavern, dating both from the ancient and<br/>
the later empire. Many of the recent excavations are now covered<br/>
with loose heaps of <span style="color: #0000FF;">light</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured </span>sand. The whole of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Necropolis has been repeatedly explored both by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Byzantines </span>and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs</span>, as well as by modern explorers. Many generations have<br/>
been enriched by its treasures, and yet an immense profusion of<br/>
relies was still left to be discovered by the indefatigable M. Mariette. It is nevertheless probable that this mine of antiquities,<br/>
which has so marvellously preserved everything committed to its<br/>
keeping, is still far from being exhausted.<br/>
<br/>
Ancient writers have recorded many interesting facts regarding<br/>
the Necropolis of Memphis, and have mentioned various parts of it<br/>
by name. The Pyramids, eleven in number, have indeed been<br/>
identified, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>has been excavated, but all trace of<br/>
many other features have been irrevocably lost. Who, for example,<br/>
can possibly tell where now to look for the sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">take </span>across which<br/>
the mummy of Apis was conveyed by boat; or the beautiful pastures near it, which were once compared with Homer's <span style="color: #0000FF;">asphodel<br/>
</span>meadows; or the temple of the gloomy Hecate, and the gates<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Couytus </span>and of Truth; or the site of the statue <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofJustice </span>without<br/>
a head; <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the multitude of sacred and profane buildings mentioned<br/>
by the later <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m-k </span>papyri as having belonged to this <span style="color: #ff0000;">burialgrouud</span>? <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the other hand, the numerous tombs within its <span style="color: #0000FF;">pro<br/>
