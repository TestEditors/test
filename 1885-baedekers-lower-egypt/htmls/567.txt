dark granite, the brown sandstone, the yellow desert, the strips of<br/>
vegetation flanking the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Firan</span>, and the solitary green spot<br/>
occupied by the large groups of palms of Rephidim (assuming <span style="color: #0000FF;">its<br/>

Geological Formation. According to Fraas the chief formations of<br/>
Mount <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serba </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>1) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gnet'ss </span>of grey colour and very <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>grain, the<br/>
component parts of which are uniformly distributed, the mica giving it a<br/>
somewhat stratified appearance; (2) Red granite of great beauty, containing little or no <span style="color: #ff0000;">mica-7 </span>(3) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dimite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">porphyry</span>, which frequently veins the<br/>
masses of gneiss and granite. The following are the principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">arms </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">diorite</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>(1) Black diorite porphyry; (2) Dark green, and somewhat<br/>
dingy diorite; (3) Diorite resembling porphyry; (<span style="color: #ff0000;">it</span>) Polyhedric porphyry<br/>
of a pale- -red colour, containing occasional crystals of <span style="color: #0000FF;">albite</span>, and a few<br/>
grains of <span style="color: #ff0000;">quartz</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">5 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>Porphyry varying in colour from brownish to bloodred, and rough and granulated to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">touch- </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">G</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Porphyry </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>which pieces<br/>
of oligoclase, about an inch in length, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">imhedded.Tu1quozses </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">finer<br/>

Is <span style="color: #0000FF;">11101011 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sal-brill </span>the Sinai of Scripture? The traveller is reminded<br/>
that during the battle of the Amalekites, Moses prayed on a rock of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ho..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>that he received Jethro after the battle, when the people were <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamped </span>by the Mount of God, and that from the entrance to the oasis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Rephidim) to the foot <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hit</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">mai </span>one <span style="color: #0000FF;">days </span>journey only is reckoned,<br/>
while <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large caravan takes two days to reach the Jebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Milsa</span>, and lastly,<br/>
that a person acquainted with the peninsula, as the leader <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lame'tes<br/>
</span>undoubtedly was, would scarcely have acted wisely, <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>while receiving<br/>
the tables of the law, he had compelled the multitude entrusted to his<br/>
care to <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamp </span>for a prolonged period <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>from the best watered and<br/>
most fruitful spot <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the whole route. As, moreover, Mt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Scrhal </span>is by<br/>
far the most imposing mountain in the peninsula, as many traditions <span style="color: #0000FF;">declare </span>it to be the scene of God's revelation to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Noses</span>, as it has long been<br/>
regarded as holy, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eusebius</span>, followed by Cosmas and other Christian<br/>
authors, identifies it with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lloreb </span>of the Bible, and as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharan </span>and Sinai<br/>
are always associated in the monkish chronicles and the resolutions of<br/>
the Councils, it would seem more justifiable to identify Mt. Serbal with<br/>
the Sinai of Scripture, than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jehel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mfisa </span>group. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">It</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serbal </span>is the<br/>
Sinai of Scripture, Moses must have conducted his people from Rephidim<br/>
through the oasis, where both space and water were inadequate to their<br/>
wants, and through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">defile </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Buw√©b</span>, into one of the neighbouring<br/>
plains in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vvadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esh-Shehh</span>, whence the mountain is visible in all its<br/>
majesty. Whilst we are almost surrounded by an amphitheatre of hills<br/>
of moderate <span style="color: #0000FF;">height </span>the imposing rocky mass of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mt</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Serhfil</span>, towering<br/>
above them all, rises to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SAY.</span>, being more prominently and distinctly<br/>
visible here, than from any other part of the peninsula.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Mount </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Serbal</span>',<br/>
observes Prof. Palmer,'seen from a little distance, exhibits such boldness<br/>
of outline, and such huge and conspicuous forms, that it is justly entitled<br/>
to be considered the grandest and most characteristic feature of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">peninsula</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>. Although the traveller must not expect to be able to <span style="color: #ff0000;">identity<br/>
</span>on Mt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbil </span>every spot referred to in the Scriptural account of the<br/>
promulgation of the law, there is no doubt that the general topography<br/>
of the district <span style="color: #ff0000;">harmonises </span>well with that <span style="color: #0000FF;">narrative </span>On again referring<br/>
to the book of Exodus (xix. 17) we find this <span style="color: #0000FF;">passage</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'And </span>Moses brought<br/>
forth the people out of the camp to meet with God; and they stood at<br/>
the nether part of the mount'. We shall see that there would have been<br/>
no room for <span style="color: #0000FF;">such </span>a movement in the wadis Er-Raha or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seba'iyeh</span>, adjoining the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Musa </span>group, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whereas </span>it was possible, and even necessary, to lead the people <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>were encamped beyond the oasis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards<br/>
</span>the foot of the mountain <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>us, perhaps as far as the hill of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meharret<br/>
</span>and the lower part of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Vadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rAleyat</span>. No one can look upon the<br/>
conspicuous and majestic Mt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serbal</span>, without being convinced that it was<br/>
far more worthy of being the throne of Jehovah, than any of the less<br/>
