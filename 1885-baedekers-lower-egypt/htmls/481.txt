<span>THE RED SEA. 6. Route. 423<br/>
<br/>
About 5 M. to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N</span>, with the remains of the ancient<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Leukos </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Limen</span>, a famous harbour in the time of the Ptolemies, but now<br/>
blocked up with coral, and accessible to small boats only.<br/>
<br/>
Between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koser </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">lids </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">limes</span>, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berenike </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span>situated, dwell<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nomadic'Ababdeh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">4:3</span>), both being tribes of a Nubian type.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sonakin </span>(10,000 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab</span>.), situated in a sterile region with a saline<br/>
soil, possesses <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>good <span style="color: #ff0000;">harbour</span>. It belonged to the Turks down to <span style="color: #0000FF;">1865<br/>
</span>when it was ceded to Egypt, and since that period it has rapidly improved. The principal part of the town lies on a small island, and there<br/>
are also a number of substantial stone houses belonging to it on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>mainland. Behind it extends the busy village of Gef, which is inhabited<br/>
by the native Bisharin. About <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/4 </span>M. farther inland are the springs<br/>
which supply the town with water and irrigate the gardens. The chief<br/>
exports, being products of the district, are cattle, hides, butter, indiarubber, tamarinds, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mother-of-pearl</span>; while ivory, ostrich-feathers, and<br/>
other commodities from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sfidan </span>are brought to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Souakin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">via </span>Kassala<br/>
and Berber, and exported <span style="color: #0000FF;">hence </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Semi'u </span>was formerly an important<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">depot </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">slave-trade</span>. This seaport is a convenient starting-point for<br/>
the exploration of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sfidan</span>, and formed the basis of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>English expedition <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>in March, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1885 </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Go-operate </span>with the Nile army <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Masau'a </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Massowah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5000 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, the seaport of Abyssinia, belonged<br/>
to the Turks as early as 1557, and has recently been ceded to Egypt.<br/>
Like <span style="color: #ff0000;">Souakin</span>, it lies on an island, opposite to which, on the mainland, are the pleasant villages of <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">To </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alokullu</span>, with their <span style="color: #ff0000;">countryhouses </span>and gardens. Masau'a carries on a brisk trade in commodities<br/>
similar to those of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Souakin</span>. The population consists of Ethiopians,<br/>
Arabs, and a few Europeans. The climate is very hot, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unhealthy</span>.<br/>
<br/>
ARABIAN SIDE. The seaports of the province of Yemen, on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.<br/>
</span>side of the Red Sea, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mama</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lemma</span>. Mokha has fallen<br/>
entirely to decay, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">lIIodeda </span>alone is visited once monthly by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">steamer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of the Austrian Lloyd. These places have long since been<br/>
superseded by the English seaport of'Aden.<br/>
<br/>
The most important seaport on the Red Sea, a great focus of Oriental<br/>
trade, and one of the wealthiest towns in the Turkish empire, is Jedda,<br/>
situated 46 <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecca </span>of which it is the port. Pilgrimages<br/>
from every Mohammedan country converge here, and the merchants<br/>
transact business with the devotees on their arrival and departure. The<br/>
inhabitants trade with the interior of Arabia, with Egypt, E. Africa as<br/>
far as Mozambique, Mesopotamia, Persia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">indie</span>, and the Malay Islands.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Jedda </span>is the chief market for pearls, mother-of-pearl, and black coral,<br/>
and for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffee</span>, balsam, senna leaves, aromatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">herbs </span>and horses and<br/>
donkeys which Arabia produces. It is also a great <span style="color: #0000FF;">depot </span>of Oriental carpets, <span style="color: #0000FF;">muslins</span>, woollen and silk <span style="color: #0000FF;">stuffs</span>, spices, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cocoa-nuts</span>, essential oils,<br/>
and other products which are exported to the western Mohammedan<br/>
countries. The imports are corn, rice<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>butter, oil, and not unfrequently<br/>
slaves. The covered bazaars and <span style="color: #0000FF;">khans </span>are therefore very interesting,<br/>
and the markets are well supplied with fruit, which does not grow in<br/>
the utterly sterile environs, but is imported from <span style="color: #ff0000;">E1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Â» </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yemen </span>by water and<br/>
still more extensively from <span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span>by land. The harbour lies at a considerable distance from the town<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>can only be approached by small<br/>
craft. Water for drinking is collected in cisterns. The houses are lofty<br/>
and substantially built, and the town possesses handsome government<br/>
buildings and a castle. Outside the walls the Muslims point out a stone<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">structure</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">120 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yds</span>. long and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gyds</span>. wide, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'Eve</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Over the'holy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">never </span>is placed a chapel, containing a hole in the interior through which<br/>
the visitor can look down on the stone covering that part of the sacred<br/>
remains. This spot is only <span style="color: #ff0000;">one- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">third </span>of the way from the feet to the<br/>
head (<span style="color: #0000FF;">39 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">yds</span>), so that the upper part of Eve's frame must have been disproportionately large. At the time of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wahhabite </span>wars the town was<br/>
taken by the Egyptians, but has again belonged to the Turks since 1840.<br/>
In 1858 a terrible massacre of the Christians took place here, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
