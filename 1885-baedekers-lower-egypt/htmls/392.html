</span>on the same hill, at a height of about a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hundred </span>feet. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chephren </span>is<br/>
said to have reigned <span style="color: #0000FF;">fifty-sis </span>years.'<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">This </span>makes altogether a hundred and six years, during which<br/>
the Egyptians suffered all kinds of oppression, and the temples<br/>
constantly remained closed. Owing to their hatred of these two<br/>
kings, the people would not even mention their names, and they<br/>
even call the pyramids after a shepherd named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philitis</span>, who at that<br/>
period pastured his <span style="color: #0000FF;">flocks </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">neighbourhood</span>".<br/>
<br/>
'After this king (Chephren), <span style="color: #ff0000;">Myeerinus</span>, the son of Cheops, is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span>to have reigned over <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>is said to have had no pleasure<br/>
in the conduct of his father, but to have <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-opened </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>temples and<br/>
to have allowed the people, reduced to extreme distress, to return<br/>
to their occupations and the worship of the gods. He is also said<br/>
to have pronounced the most just judgments of all the kings.'<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Ire</span>, too, left behind him a pyramid, but a much smaller one<br/>
than that built by his father. Each of its sides measures 280 feet<br/>
only, and half of it consists <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEthiopian </span>stone. Some ofthe Greeks<br/>
state that this was the pyramid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhodopis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>a <span style="color: #ff0000;">eourtezan</span>; but they<br/>
are wrong; nay, when they maintain this, they do not seem to me<br/>
even to know who this Rhodopis was, for she flourished in the time<br/>
of King Amasis, and not in the reign of this king (comp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">348 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>.'<br/>
<br/>
The account given by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Siculns </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Li</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">63</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Vi</span>) is as follows:<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-'The </span>eighth king was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chembes</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memphite</span>, who reigned<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lifty </span>years. He built the largest of the three pyramids, which<br/>
were reckoned among the seven wonders of the world. They are<br/>
to be found in the direction of Libya, 120 stadia distant from<br/>
Memphis, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">io </span>from the Nile. The sight of these great masses<br/>
and their artistic construction excites surprise and admiration. The<br/>
base of the largest, the plan of which is quadrilateral, is seven<br/>
plethra <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_700 </span>ft.) on <span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>side; and the height is more than six<br/>
plethra. The sides gradually contract towards the top, where<br/>
each is still <span style="color: #0000FF;">sis</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cubits </span>broad. The whole building is of hard<br/>
stone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">how</span>, and it is <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofeverlasting </span>duration. <span style="color: #ff0000;">l'ornoless<br/>
</span>than a thousand (some writers even say three <span style="color: #0000FF;">thousand</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>years are<br/>
said to have elapsed from the building of the pyramids down to<br/>
the present time; and yet these stones, in their original jointing,<br/>
and the whole structure are preserved uninjured by time. The<br/>
stones are said to have been brought all the way from Arabia,<br/>
and the building to have been erected by means of embankments,<br/>
as no lifting machines had yet been invented. And the most<br/>
wonderful thing is, that, around the place where this enormous<br/>
work is built, nothing is to be found but sandy soil, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">thereisno<br/>
</span>trace either of the embankment or of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span>of the stones; so<br/>
that one might <span style="color: #0000FF;">believe </span>that the whole mass had not been gradually<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on-vtml </span>by human hands, but had been placed by some god in <span style="color: #0000FF;">this<br/>
