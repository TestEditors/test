from the Holy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sepnlchre </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jerusalem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>On this day it is customary for<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">31111111115 </span>to use a kind of eye-powder for the purpose of strengthening<br/>
their eyes, to get themselves bled, and to eat coloured Easter eggs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>Easter Sunday (<span style="color: #0000FF;">rid </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tnr-rrasdizr</span>) the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Molinmmcdans </span>usually visit their<br/>
Christian friends, and these <span style="color: #ff0000;">Visits </span>are returned during the feast of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beirim</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>the RISING <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE NILE <span style="color: #0000FF;">there </span>are also connected <span style="color: #0000FF;">several </span>interesting festivals, closely resembling those of the ancient period of the<br/>
Pharaohs, which even the Christian epoch was unable entirely to <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohliterate</span>. As, however, they take place in summer, few travellers will<br/>
have an opportunity of witnessing them. As these festivals have reference to a regularly recurring phenomenon of nature, their dates are <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessarily </span>fixed in accordance with the Coptic solar reckoning of time, instead of the variable Arabian lunar <span style="color: #0000FF;">year</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The night of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lith </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the<br/>
Coptic month <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ra'fina </span>(17th June) is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lem </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">err-Aruhyr</span>, i.e. the'night<br/>
of the drop', as it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">relieved </span>that a drop from heaven <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>a tear of <span style="color: #ff0000;">lsis</span>,<br/>
according to the ancient Egyptian myth) falls into the Nile on this night<br/>
and causes its rise. The astrologers profess to calculate precisely the<br/>
hour of the fall of the sacred drop. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairenes </span>spend this night on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">banks </span>of the Nile, either in the open air, or in the houses of friends<br/>
near the river, and practise all kinds of superstitious customs. One of<br/>
these consists in the placing of a piece of dough by each member of a<br/>
family on the roof of the house; if the dough rises, happiness is in store<br/>
for the person who placed it there, while its failure to rise is regarded<br/>
as a had omen. On <span style="color: #0000FF;">let </span>June the river begins slowly to rise (comp.<br/>

</span>The duration of the traveller's stay at Cairo depends of course<br/>
on his own inclination and the objects he has in view. He may<br/>
wish to devote his attention chiefly to the mosques, or to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">streetscenes</span>; he may endeavour to find his <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>through the intricacies<br/>
of the city alone, or with the assistance of a donkey-boy, or he may<br/>
