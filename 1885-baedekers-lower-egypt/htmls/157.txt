Isis. Muth. Hathor. These three goddesses, although <span style="color: #0000FF;">externally </span>regarded as separate, were really different <span style="color: #0000FF;">modifications </span>of the<br/>
same fundamental idea. As a counterpart of the male generative<br/>
principle, they all represent the female element, the conceiving<br/>
and gestative principle, or the receptacle in which the regeneration<br/>
of the self-creating god takes place. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mum</span>, whose name <span style="color: #0000FF;">signifies<br/>
</span>mother, is represented as a vulture, or with a vulture's head. She<br/>
is the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">birth-giver</span>, who protects Osiris and Pharaoh with her<br/>
outspread wings, and she guards the cradle of the Nile, whose<br/>
mysterious source is defended by a serpent. The functions of Isis<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>130), who endows everything that is capable of life on earth<br/>
with the good and the beautiful, have already been mentioned. She<br/>
wears on her head the vulture cap, cow's horns, and the disk of the<br/>
<br/>
moon, or the throne<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>or all four combined. As Isis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sella</span>, she is<br/>
<br/>
represented with a scorpion<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>hovering over her head, as Isis<br/>
<br/>
Neith, who is also equivalent to Muth, usually with a weaver's<br/>
shuttle <span style="color: #ff0000;">> </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">131</span>, while as Isis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sothis</span>, or the dog-star, she sails in a<br/>
boat. She is also represented as suckling the infant <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>in her<br/>
lap. Her sacred animal is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">now</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>belongs also to Isis<br/>
Hathor. The name Hathor signifies'house of Horus<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>, for within<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the bosom of this goddess the young god gave himself new<br/>
life. She is the goddess of love, the great mother, who accords her<br/>
divine protection to all earthly mothers, the dispenser of all <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
