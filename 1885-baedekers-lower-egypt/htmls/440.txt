<br/>
of the Nile, which at many places measured as many ells as there were<br/>
days in each phase of the moon, was also called the "Festival of the<br/>
Birth of Apis', and the period of 25 years, which was named after Apis,<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>lunar epoch, consisting of 309 average synodic <span style="color: #0000FF;">months</span>, equivalent<br/>
to about 25 Egyptian years. <span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>Apis survived his allotted period of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">25 </span>years, it is said that he used to be drowned in the Nile, but this cannot have been the invariable practice<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>as the Apis inscriptions mention<br/>
that one of these sacred bulls lived 26 years.<br/>
<br/>
The whole of the area was excavated and explored by Mariette, who in 1850 found a number of sphinxes from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkfira<br/>
</span>in private gardens, and was thus led to conjecture that they <span style="color: #0000FF;">belonged </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapis </span>Temple mentioned by Strabo and in several<br/>
Greek papyri. The passage in Strabo runs <span style="color: #0000FF;">thus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'There </span>is also<br/>
a temple of Serapis there in a very sandy place, so that mounds of<br/>
dust are heaped up by the wind, by which the sphinxes are either<br/>
buried up to their heads or half concealed, whence one may <span style="color: #0000FF;">understand </span>the danger incurred by a person going to the temple and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">overtaken </span>by a gust of wind<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>.--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the course of his excavations<br/>
M. Mariette first came <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the Sphinx Avenue, which led from<br/>
the Apis tombs to a Serapeum of the Greek period. It terminated<br/>
on the E. side, where the chief entrance was situated, in a semicircle formed by eleven statues of Greek philosophers and poets,<br/>
which now grace the Louvre. The narrow approach (Dramas) was<br/>
flanked by a double wall, on which stood the figures of animals<br/>
mentioned above.<br/>
<br/>
The Greek Serapeum, which was in the best preservation, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>small<br/>
example of the simple form of a Greek temple'in antis', and consisted<br/>
of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">calm </span>and a pronaos, approached by a flight of steps, with two Corinthian columns between <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">anue</span>' or pilasters of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">f'de</span>. Adjoining<br/>
this Greek temple stood an Egyptian chapel with walls sloping inwards<br/>
and a concave cornice, which was once adorned with the fine statue of<br/>
the Apis bull now preserved in the Louvre. <span style="color: #0000FF;">la </span>the sand under the pavement in front of these buildings were found an immense number <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofsmall<br/>
</span>bronze images of gods, of which no fewer than 531 were collected in one<br/>
day. The desert and the sterile sand with which it is covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>regarded by the Egyptians <span style="color: #ff0000;">as'typhouic</span>', or under the influence of Typhon,<br/>
the god of evil, and these images were <span style="color: #ff0000;">accordineg </span>placed in it with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>to purge and <span style="color: #ff0000;">consecratc </span>it.<br/>
<br/>
The upper part of an Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum</span>, which seems to have<br/>
been built in the usual form of the Egyptian temples (with pylons,<br/>
anterior court, etc), was also discovered here, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">u </span>as partly destroyed or overthrown in the course ofthe excavations. These scanty<br/>
remains, together with those of the Greek Serapeum, are now completely covered with sand, to a depth, it is said, of <span style="color: #ff0000;">60 </span>ft. or more.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Within </span>the extensive chambers of the Serapeum there was also established a colony of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hermits</span>, who lived in the strictest seclusion in cells<br/>
attached to the various chapels of the temple, as appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>recently<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">deciphered </span>Greek papyri in the British Museum and the Louvre, which<br/>
were brought from Memphis. Connected with the worship of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapis</span>,<br/>
the deity revered above all others in <span style="color: #ff0000;">thc </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Alexandrian </span>period, there was<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">regularly </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">organised </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">monastic </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">system</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">monks </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">xi-ruler</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'reeluses0 </span>on entering <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>order gave up all their<br/>
