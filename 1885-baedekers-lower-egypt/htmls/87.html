<span>THE OASES. 65<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Where </span>the springs are common property, the periodical distribution of<br/>
the water has from time immemorial formed the subject of statutory regulations. The cultivable land consists of open fields and of gardens,<br/>
which are carefully enclosed with earthen walls <span style="color: #ff0000;">abouttift</span>. high, crowned<br/>
with twisted palm-leaves, for the purpose of keeping out intruders, or are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>rarely hedged in with branches of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">shut </span>or other thorny plant.<br/>
<br/>
In the oases, as in the valley of the Nile, a regular rotation of winter and summer <span style="color: #0000FF;">crops </span>is observed (comp. p. 72), although, with their<br/>
uniform supply of <span style="color: #0000FF;">water</span>, there is not the same necessity for it. The<br/>
winter <span style="color: #0000FF;">erupt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">wheat </span>and barley; those of summer are rice, dura<br/>
(Sorghum <span style="color: #0000FF;">vulgare</span>), and a small proportion of dukhn (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pemicitlaritt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">spicuta</span>),<br/>
while in <span style="color: #ff0000;">dehel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khdrgeh </span>indigo is grown in <span style="color: #ff0000;">considerahle </span>quantities.<br/>
Cotton is also cultivated to a small extent, but the yield is hardly adequate for even the local requirements. By far the most important fruit<br/>
yielded by the gardens is that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">date-palm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The delicious dates<br/>
are very superior to those of the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">valley</span>, and they form<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>particularly<br/>
at Dakhel and <span style="color: #0000FF;">aims</span>, the only important article of export. Olive-trees<br/>
also occur in all the oases, especially in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ir</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fut</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bahriyeh</span>, and Siwa,<br/>
where they yield a considerable quantity of oil, besides which there are<br/>
apricots, oranges, lemons, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">melting</span>, but very few other fruit trees.<br/>
The ordinary vegetables grown in the valley of the Nile, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">lettuces</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">eahhages</span>. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">lgultgas</span>, are never met with; nor have the recently introduced <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cane </span>and the beautiful <span style="color: #ff0000;">lehhek </span>acacia <span style="color: #ff0000;">tp</span>. 76) yet found<br/>
their way to the oases. The venerable sunt-trees (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">77 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>form a very<br/>
characteristic feature of the southern oases. They generally shade the<br/>
wells<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>the sites of old wells <span style="color: #ff0000;">now </span>tilled up owing <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>neglect, and they<br/>
indicate the course of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">water'conduits </span>to the still distant traveller.<br/>
<br/>
The most prominent of the indigenous plants of the oases is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">roshr<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Colon-opts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">profit-u</span>). which is also common on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">banks </span>of the Nile in<br/>
Upper Egypt. It is a broad-leaved <span style="color: #ff0000;">shruh </span>or small tree, attaining <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>height<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>ft. or more, with a copious milky and very <span style="color: #0000FF;">poisonous </span>sap, and round<br/>
fruit of the size of a large apple containing woolly seeds, and known on<br/>
the banks of the Dead Sea as the'apple <span style="color: #0000FF;">ei </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shatter</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The indigenous animals of the oases are much fewer in number than<br/>
those of the valley of the Nile. The only large mammal that occurs is<br/>
the gazelle, which is also found in the sterile parts of the Libyan desert.<br/>
The only beasts of prey are several varieties of jackals (Arab. <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lib</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">foxes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Arab</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ta'teb</span>). Among the latter is the pretty fenek, which is only<br/>
halt the size of the European fox, yellowish-grey in colour, and with<br/>
ears longer than the breadth of the head. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyenas </span>seem to be unknown,<br/>
except in Bahriyeh. The timid ostrich rarely visits the Libyan oases.<br/>
<br/>
The domestic animals kept by the inhabitants of the oases consist of<br/>
a few horses, numerous donkeys of a small and weakly type, which will<br/>
not <span style="color: #ff0000;">hear </span>comparison with their strong and active <span style="color: #ff0000;">eongeners </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofAlexandria<br/>
</span>and Cairo, and a few oxen, sheep, and goats. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buffaloes </span>are also kept in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khargeh </span>and a few in Bahriyeh. It is surprising how few camels are to<br/>
he found in the oases, but it is said that the bite of a certain tly <span style="color: #0000FF;">endangers </span>their lives in summer. Turkeys and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fowls </span>are plentiful.<br/>
<br/>
The population of the oases is not of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>uniform character. According<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the original inhabitants were Libyan <span style="color: #0000FF;">tor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ber-her</span>) tribes, but<br/>
after <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>oases were annexed to Egypt many new settlers were introduced<br/>
from the valley of the Nile and from Nubia. The Berber nationality of<br/>
the inhabitants of the oasis of Ammon, notwithstanding its having been<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">connected </span>with Egypt for several thousand years and its reception of<br/>
immigrants from the west in the middle ages, is still very marked, while<br/>
the population of the other oases, like that of the Nile valley, has<br/>
adopted the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabic </span>language. In Bahriyeh (where, besides the natives of<br/>
the place, there is a colony of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Siwanese </span>who still speak the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berber </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dialect</span>) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Farifra </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">physiognomic </span>type of the Berber race still predominates; <span style="color: #0000FF;">type</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>while in Siwa, through which<br/>
