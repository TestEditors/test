<br/>
requires to be removed, the most interesting, and after that of<br/>
Ti the best preserved, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Mastaba of Ptahhotep, which lies a little to the W. of the<br/>
path from the step-pyramid to Mariette's House.<br/>
<br/>
Ptahhotep, like Ti, lived in the 5th Dynasty, and was a priest of the<br/>
Pyramids of Aser, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">user</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'divine </span>dwelling of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Men-kau-Hor</span>'.<br/>
He also bore a number of other titles. The best portrait of him is on<br/>
the E. wall. His costume is similar to that of Ti (p. 398). His young<br/>
son, with the lock denoting infancy, is holding his staff with his right<br/>
hand and a hoopoe in his left. The visitor should observe the harvest<br/>
of the papyrus plant, and the games which were probably connected with<br/>
the vintage <span style="color: #0000FF;">festival </span>The grapes are being plucked, trodden, and pressed.<br/>
A hunting scene lower down is full of humour and life, and some of the<br/>
animals will interest zoologists. Most of the hounds <span style="color: #ff0000;">are'slughi</span>' (p. 398).<br/>
The attack and slaughter of the gazelle is a very spirited scene. Ptahhotep also indulges in lion-hunting. A lion is represented seizing in its<br/>
jaws the muzzle of a cow tied up as a bait, and fastening its claws into<br/>
the animal's neck, while the calf stands behind its mother, and the<br/>
kneeling hunter with his two hounds points out to them the lion on<br/>
which he is about to let them loose. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">fishing </span>and fowling scenes are<br/>
particularly well executed. Another successful representation on the<br/>
same wall is the procession of the retainers of Ptahhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">hearing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings<br/>
</span>from the different villages on his estates. Like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span>processions<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>pilgrims at Cairo, this <span style="color: #ff0000;">cort√©ge </span>is headed by pugilists and prizefighters. Captive lions and other smaller wild animals are being carried<br/>
in cages, and the master of the dogs is leading his greyhounds and another kind of hound resembling a hyena. Next follow mountain-goats,<br/>
antelopes, and oxen. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">cow </span>is calving with the aid of a veterinary surgeon, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">number </span>of calves on the ground are struggling violently to<br/>
disengage themselves from the cords with which they are bound. After<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>come <span style="color: #0000FF;">flocks </span>of poultry. If the inscriptions are to be believed, Ptahhotep possessed 121,000 geese of one kind and 11,210 of another, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1925<br/>
</span>swans, 120,000 small geese, <span style="color: #ff0000;">121.022 </span>pigeons, and 111,200 goslings. Among<br/>
the domestic poultry are included cranes, which their keeper brings before his master, counted, and in good order. Ptahhotep, sitting on a<br/>
throne, wearing a panther-skin, and anointing himself with oil, surveys<br/>
the rich produce of his estates, watches the slaughter of his cattle, approves of the order kept by his <span style="color: #0000FF;">clerks </span>and listens to the music of harps<br/>
and flutes. The list is exceedingly instructive owing to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">distinutncss<br/>
</span>of the determinative symbols <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>accompany the carefully written<br/>
words. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba </span>also contains a false door, bearing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">representation<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the entrance to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>tomb as a symbol, on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>wall.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastaba </span>of Sabu, to the E. of that of Ti, contains similar<br/>
representations, and an enumeration of the various kinds of cattle<br/>
possessed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deceased </span>Of one kind of cattle he possessed 405,<br/>
of another 1237, and of a third 1300; of calves <span style="color: #0000FF;">1220 </span>of one kind,<br/>
and 1138 of another. Besides <span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span>he had 1308 antelope, and 1010<br/>
herons. The poultry (geese, ducks, and pigeons) is reckoned by<br/>
<br/>
thousands (<span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>= 1000).<br/>
<br/>
After having visited the Necropolis, the traveller may, if time<br/>
permit, proceed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Mastaba </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Far'iln</span>', which belongs to the<br/>
