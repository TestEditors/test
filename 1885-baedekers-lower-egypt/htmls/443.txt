sarcophagus. These tablets have yielded most valuable information<br/>
as to the ancient Egyptian mode of reckoning time, and particularly regarding the later periods <span style="color: #ff0000;">ongyptian </span>history, as they record<br/>
the days, months, and years of the king's reign on which the Apis<br/>
revered by the donor was born, enthroned, and interred respectively.<br/>
We have thus been enabled to determine with precision the duration of the reigns of many of the Pharaohs and the order in which<br/>
they succeeded each other. Most of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>are now preserved<br/>
in the Louvre. If the ceremonies which accompanied the <span style="color: #ff0000;">obseqnics<br/>
</span>of the Apis bulls were as <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>were costly, Diodorus probably does not exaggerate when he informs us that<br/>
the chief priest of an Apis bull which died of old age shortly after<br/>
the accession of Ptolemy Lagi expended on its burial not only the<br/>
whole of a large sum then in the coffers of the temple, but a farther sum of fifty talents of silver (about 11,7001.) advanced by<br/>
the king. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span>also assures us that in his time the keeper of<br/>
Apis (whose office <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>doubtless a very honourable <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>spent no<br/>
less than a hundred talents on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obsequies </span>of a bull.<br/>
<br/>
Passing through the gateway, we enter a Chamber (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">la</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>of<br/>
considerable dimensions, with niches of various sizes in the bare<br/>
limestone walls, where votive tablets of the kind mentioned above<br/>
were once placed. Visitors light their candles here. The guide<br/>
now proceeds towards the right. After a few paces we observe at<br/>
our feet a huge block of black granite <span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">c</span>), which once formed<br/>
the lid of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus </span>Beyond it we turn to the left, and after<br/>
ten paces reach an enormous granite sarcophagus <span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. d), which so<br/>
nearly fills the passage that there is only just room to pass it on its<br/>
right side. The lid and the sarcophagus belong to each other, having doubtless been executed for the reception of one of the sacred<br/>
bulls, but were probably stopped here on their way to the vault<br/>
for which they were destined, in consequence of the crisis in<br/>
Egypt's history which caused the overthrow of the worship of Apis.<br/>
Beyond this sarcophagus we continue to proceed towards the W.<br/>
between <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>walls of rock, and then turn to the left <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>into another passage destitute of ornament. This leads us to the Principal Passage <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jn</span>. A, B), running parallel with the first, from E. to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">W.</span>, and penetrating the solid <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock </span>This passage is flanked with<br/>
the side-chambers, about 26 ft. in height, which contain the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>sarcophagi of the Apis bulls (see above), each consisting of<br/>
a single block of black or red polished granite or <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">limestone</span>. One<br/>
of the finest (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">e</span>), composed of black granite, and bearing the<br/>
best executed hieroglyphic inscriptions on its polished exterior,<br/>
may be entered by means of a ladder. After having traversed the<br/>
whole of the W. part of the main gallery and returned to the point<br/>
at which we entered it, we next visit the <span style="color: #ff0000;">B</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Part </span>of the gallery,<br/>
where we observe several <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>sarcophagi. We then reach a <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">passage </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>diverging <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the right, from which another passage<br/>
