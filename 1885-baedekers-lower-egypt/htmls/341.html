In the centre of the room: <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3961</span>. Statue of King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kltcfrcn </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Khafre</span>, the builder of the second pyramid, found in the well of<br/>
the granite temple near the Great Sphinx (p. 365)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The king is represented in life-size, sitting on a throne, the arms of<br/>
which terminate in lions<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>heads. At the sides of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">seat </span>are papyrus<br/>
<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">lotus </span>plants intertwined around the symbol of union, which indi<br/>
cates the junction of Upper with Lower Egypt, and is perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">emblematical </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the transition from this life to the next. On the pedestal, to the<br/>
right and left of the feet of the statue, is inscribed in distinct <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">characters</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prince </span>and victorious <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lihafra</span>, the good<br/>
god and lord of the diadem'. In his right hand the monarch holds <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>roll of papyrus. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the top of the back of the throne is <span style="color: #ff0000;">ahawk</span>, protecting the king's head with its outspread wings. The torso is of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mere<br/>
</span>thickset type than is the case with the statues of the modern empire,<br/>
having been modelled in accordance with the rules prescribed by the<br/>
hieratic canon at that early period, and the whole figure breathes a spirit<br/>
of strength and repose. The muscles of the breast and legs are reproduced with wonderful accuracy. The statue is <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span>of an extremely<br/>
hard diorite, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>of working which has been overcome by the<br/>
artist in a marvellous manner.<br/>

The feet, which had been broken <span style="color: #0000FF;">off</span>, are<br/>
restored, but the rest of the figure is in its original condition. The upper part of the body and the legs are bare, while from the hips hangs a<br/>
kind of apron folded in front. In the hand is the long rod of <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>. The<br/>
round head with its short hair, and the portrait-like, good-natured face<br/>
are remarkably life-like. The eyes, which have a somewhat rigid <span style="color: #0000FF;">expression</span>, were put in, as in the case of other similar statues, after the<br/>
work was completed. They consist of pieces of opaque white quartz with<br/>
pupils formed of rock-crystal, in the centre of which is placed a polished<br/>
metal knob for the double purpose of securing them and giving them<br/>
light and sparkle; and they are framed with thin plates of bronze, the<br/>
edges of which form the eyelids. The figure was originally covered with<br/>
a thin coating of plaster <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Paris </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">painted</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>The female torso in the<br/>

This group, executed in green basalt, and found at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salilriira</span>, is one<br/>
of the best <span style="color: #0000FF;">works </span>of the 26th dynasty.
