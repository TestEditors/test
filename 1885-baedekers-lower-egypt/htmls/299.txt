<br/>
A long series of tortuous streets, called Derb <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-fr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">anttnth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">C'syearnore </span>street<span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, running not far from the canal, leads hence<br/>
towards the N. to the Boulevard <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alche'met </span>Ali. After fully half-amile we come to a small open space by the canal, shaded by some<br/>
fine acacias. The gate 011 the right leads to the viceroyal <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Library<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kutubkhcinch</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. 30), founded by the Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismail </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Oil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">24th<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">March </span>1870, in the left wing of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>of the minister of <span style="color: #0000FF;">public<br/>
</span>worship. The collection consists of a number of books formerly<br/>
preserved in various other institutions, and of others purchased or<br/>
presented by the Khedive, and is dedicated to the use of the public.<br/>
One of the finest presentations to the collection is the valuable<br/>
library of Mustafa Pasha, which occupies a separate room. The<br/>
whole library consists of about 25,000 vols., <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>Arabic and<br/>
Turkish works, and there is a small European department, principally containing <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>works in French, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is to be gradually extended. The library is open to the public from 3 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">G </span>and<br/>
from 7 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>o'clock by Arabian time, Le. about three hours in the<br/>
forenoon and three hours in the afternoon, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>are<br/>
instructed to afford visitors all the information in their power.<br/>
Books must be consulted in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reading-room</span>, the use of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>is accorded to persons provided with a permission from the ministry<br/>
of public instruction or with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">certificate </span>from their consul, hearing their names, and available for a year. The library is closed on<br/>
Fridays; and during the month of Ramadan it is open in the<br/>
afternoon only. The chief credit of arranging and increasing this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>collection of books belongs to two Germans, Dr. Stern and Dr.<br/>
Spitta-Bey (d. 1883), but the present director is an Arab <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh</span>,<br/>
named Murad Effendi.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">liberality </span>with which the treasures of Muslim literature are thus<br/>
thrown open to the European public is deserving of all praise. A special feature of the library, possessed by no other Oriental collection<br/>
available to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Frank-s</span>, consists of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">illusulzif</span>, or copies of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">11011111</span>,<br/>
collected <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>various mosques of Cairo<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and now preserved from <span style="color: #0000FF;">destruction</span>. They are remarkable for their large size, superb execution,<br/>
and great age, and constitute the finest existing specimens <span style="color: #0000FF;">0111111111111 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11-h<br/>
<br/>
</span>The oldest specimen of the Koran is one in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cufic</span>, or early Arabian,<br/>
character, 12 inches in length, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">83/1 </span>inches in width. It contains onehalf of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">1101311 </span>only, and is in a very damaged condition, having,<br/>
moreover, <span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>been injured by fire. The titles of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">siirebs </span>are bordered<br/>
with gold, and the carefully written text illuminated with coloured letters.<br/>
According to the testimony of a <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>saw <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'noble </span>book' in<br/>
its perfect condition this Koran was written by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ga'far </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">deik</span>, son of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bath</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>son <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Ali </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Zen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'Abidin</span>, son of <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIusen</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">son </span>of'Ali,<br/>
son of Abu <span style="color: #ff0000;">Talib </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">son- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaw </span>of the Prophet. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gaffer </span>was a great<br/>
chemist <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>scholar, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span>pupil Tartusi, according to Ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khallikuu<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ct</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>ed. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bulak</span>), once stated that he had <span style="color: #0000FF;">Written </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span>500 <span style="color: #0000FF;">different<br/>
</span>pamphlets. He lived in the years <span style="color: #0000FF;">80-148 </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hegira</span>, and this <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kori</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>would thus be about 1150 years <span style="color: #0000FF;">oN</span>. There is considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">doubt </span>as to<br/>
the accuracy of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">story</span>, but the <span style="color: #ff0000;">MS. </span>is certainly of very early date.<br/>
<br/>
The other fine large copies <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Koran, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>in all, are of later<br/>
origin, most of them having been executed by order of the sultans of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahrite </span>Mamelukes (<span style="color: #0000FF;">12601382</span>) and of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Circassian </span>Mamelukes (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1382-1516</span>),<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>a few of them date from the still later period of the Osman <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultans</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
