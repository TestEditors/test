</span>surnamed'the great. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the E. wall of the principal chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">we<br/>
</span>see <span style="color: #0000FF;">writers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">engaged </span>in recording the number of cattle of each kind<br/>
possessed by the deceased. The representatives of the different<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flocks </span>placed beside the numbers are admirably <span style="color: #0000FF;">executed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and<br/>
faithful to nature even in their attitudes. The sign I is equivalent<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">n </span>to 10, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>to 100, these symbols being repeated so as to<br/>
represent the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hundreds </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tens </span>and units of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the various <span style="color: #0000FF;">flocks<br/>
<br/>
</span>consisted. Thus <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sgggnflnw </span>coupled with the figure <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bull</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">indicates </span>that <span style="color: #ff0000;">lihafra-ankh </span>possessed 835 bulls, and in a similar manner we are informed that he had <span style="color: #0000FF;">220 </span>cattle without horns, <span style="color: #ff0000;">760 </span>asses,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'2'235 </span>goats of the antelope kind, and 974 goats. Besides these animals we also distinguish the more or less obliterated representations<br/>
of a voyage <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the river, the measurement of corn, the felling of<br/>
trees, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cm</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the S. wall we find a portrait of the deceased<br/>
and his wife, both in a sitting posture, with tables covered with<br/>
offerings before them.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">*Camphell</span>'s Tomb, which may be visited <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the way back from<br/>
the Sphinx to the Great Pyramid, is larger than most of the others<br/>
mentioned below. It is of comparatively late origin, dating, as the<br/>
inscriptions record, from the 7th cent. and the 26th Dynasty. The<br/>
upper part has been entirely destroyed, and the deep and wide<br/>
shaft, at the bottom of which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chamber </span>vaulted with an<br/>
arch having a span of <span style="color: #0000FF;">11 </span>ft., <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>uncovered. The tomb was <span style="color: #0000FF;">discovered </span>in the course of excavations made by Col. Vyse in 1837, and<br/>
named by him after <span style="color: #ff0000;">001</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Campbell, the British <span style="color: #0000FF;">consul-general </span>of<br/>
Egypt at that period. The shaft is 301/2 ft. wide from E. to W.,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">26 </span>ft. from N. to <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.</span>, and 533/4 ft. in depth. The sarcophagi found<br/>
here were in niches, and not in the vaulted chamber. One of these,<br/>
new in the British Museum, is composed of red granite, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">prismatic </span>in form, and bears numerous inscriptions. The arched lid<br/>
bears the portrait of a bearded mummy at its upper end, <span style="color: #ff0000;">andaprofusion </span>of funereal scenes and inscriptions in the style of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">25th </span>Dynasty. Two sarcophagi in basalt and another in whitish<br/>
quartzose stone were also found here. From all of these the bodies<br/>
had been removed. The vaulted chapel had also been forcibly<br/>
entered on the W. side, but the passage is now closed.<br/>
