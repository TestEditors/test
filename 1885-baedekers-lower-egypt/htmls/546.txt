<span>480 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">JO</span>. PENINSULA <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>SINAI. History<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">511</span>) alone is mentioned as a visitor to Mount Sinai. Down to the<br/>
time of the first settlement of the early Christians, we rarely have any<br/>
mention of travellers in the peninsula; but they are mentioned on some<br/>
Egyptian inscriptions, on the occasion of the journeys to Ophir<br/>
(1 Kings <span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span>. 26, 28), and lastly in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few notices of the history of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nahattcans</span>, a people from the N.E., who took possession of the commercial<br/>
route abandoned by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">thni </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ms</span>, and, from the famous rocky city of<br/>
Petra, commanded the peninsula down to about the period of the birth of<br/>
Christ. Numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">roe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>in the districts we are about to visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">bear </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>(p. 494) which owe their origin to the heathen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nabata-ans</span>.<br/>
Down to the beginning of the Christian era, the population probably<br/>
led a similar life to that of the present day. Shepherds pastured their<br/>
flocks here, and merchants and pilgrims traversed the wadis on<br/>
camels, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>ascended to the summit of the sacred Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serhal</span>. The caravans of the merchants, however, were more richly freighted than at<br/>
the present day, while the natives, instead of praying to Allah and the<br/>
Prophet, worshipped the brilliant stars in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cloudless </span>sky of this almost<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rainless </span>country. On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">diffusion </span>of Christianity, the deserts of the<br/>
peninsula were peopled by a new race, and assumed a new appearance<br/>
and a more important position. Arabia Petraea lay between the two<br/>
lands which had embraced Christianity most ardently, namely Syria<br/>
and Egypt, and soon became an asylum <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the believers of these two<br/>
countries who longed for pardon and redemption, and who hoped, by<br/>
subjecting themselves to misery and privations in this world, to attain<br/>
salvation in the next. Their great exemplars were Moses and Elijah, both<br/>
of whom had trodden the sacred soil of the peninsula, and this region<br/>
therefore appeared to them a most appropriate place of retirement from<br/>
the business and pleasures of a wicked world. The first seeds of Christianity, which bore fruit <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Trajan</span>'s reign, were perhaps sown here by<br/>
St. Paul about <span style="color: #0000FF;">Al</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D. </span>105 the peninsula was annexed to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">human </span>empire by Cornelius <span style="color: #0000FF;">Palm</span>, prefect of Syria. After the middle<br/>
of the 4th cent. the peninsula was gradually peopled with Anchorites and<br/>
numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coenobites</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>who were bound by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>common monastic rule.<br/>
Tradition ascribes the foundation of the brotherhoods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hermits </span>and<br/>
monks to St. Paul of Thebes and St. Anthony of Roma, but the most<br/>
recent investigations (comp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>385) prove this conjecture to be improbable.<br/>
() n <span style="color: #0000FF;">lilt</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sorbal </span>and in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">want </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fit'an</span>, the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharan</span>, was situated<br/>
the most thickly inhabited <span style="color: #ff0000;">settlement0aurajof </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">anchorites </span>known to have<br/>
existed in any of the localities frequented by the early Christians. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">penitents </span>were not only exposed to privations of every kind, but to the<br/>
attacks of the cruel and <span style="color: #0000FF;">rapacious </span>Saracens and Blemmyes. About the<br/>
year <span style="color: #0000FF;">305 </span>forty of the monks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">b</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">net </span>were massacred by the Saracens.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">301-63 </span>St. Julian founded a church on Sinai (<span style="color: #0000FF;">lilt</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Semi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Terrible<br/>
massacres of the monks of Sinai were again perpetrated by the Saracens<br/>
in 373 and 395 or <span style="color: #0000FF;">MI</span>, of which Ammonius and Nilus, two eye-witnesses,<br/>
have given accounts. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the 5th cent. many of the monks and anchorites<br/>
embraced heretical doctrines, which exposed them to severe persecutions,<br/>
dedicated to the Virgin, was built halfway up <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mount </span>Sinai (on the site<br/>
of the present chapel of Elijah), while a very strong fortress was constructed at the foot of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hill</span>, and provided with a garrison, to prevent<br/>
the Saracens of the peninsula from invading Palestine <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see p. 500). <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>cent. the armies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>began their victorious career.<br/>
They <span style="color: #0000FF;">did </span>not penetrate into the interior of the peninsula<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>but doubtless<br/>
took possession of Aila <span style="color: #0000FF;">tantrum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, which was <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>inhabited by Jews.<br/>
In the course of subsequent expeditions, the peninsula of Sinai was found<br/>
to be almost exclusively occupied by a Christian population. The wandering tribes of the natives readily embraced the new religion, and the<br/>
monasteries and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mile </span>of the anchorites were <span style="color: #0000FF;">ere </span>long deserted. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">monks </span>of the Monastery of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Transfiguration </span>alone continued to maintain<br/>
their position in spite of <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties</span>, partly by their resolute <span style="color: #0000FF;">conduct</span>, and partly <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stratagem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">504</span>). In the time of the Crusades, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ai </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t<br/>
