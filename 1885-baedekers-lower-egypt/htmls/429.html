of the embankment (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">372</span>), which leads back to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrashfin</span>,<br/>
and then turn to the N. and traverse the whole of the plantation,<br/>
until we reach another embankment which winds across the plain<br/>
towards the W., <span style="color: #ff0000;">andis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">interruptedbytwo </span>bridges. Distance from the<br/>
statue of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ist </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bridge </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>min.; thence to the second<br/>
bridge <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>4 hr.; from this bridge to the margin of the desert 20 min.<span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>and to Mariette's <span style="color: #0000FF;">house </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>min. more. (The return-route to the<br/>
station of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrash√©n </span>will take nearly <span style="color: #ff0000;">11/2 </span>hr., without stoppage.)<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>two routes unite on the outskirts of the desert, and ascend<br/>
to the plateau over the ruins of an ancient village which was perhaps inhabited by the embalmers of the dead. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right are<br/>
grottoes hewn in the rocks. Near the first of these is a deep shaft<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>now covered up, where human mummies, and those of several <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats</span>,<br/>
were found. In the third grotto, on the right, is the figure ofa<br/>
cow <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>in the rock, representing the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Father </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>135).<br/>
<br/>
The traveller may inspect the step-pyramid (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">382</span>) of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">15513 </span>on the way <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mariette</span>'s House, at which he is recommended to rest before visiting the rest of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span>.<br/>
This pyramid is reached by either of the paths indicated on the<br/>
map (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>378) <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>minutes. One of these leads to the N.,<br/>
round the small pyramid nearest to the step-pyramid, and then<br/>
turns to the W. through a sandy depression; the other path leads<br/>
more <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the left <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">NJVj</span>), passing several tombs and shafts, straight<br/>
in the direction of the Step-Pyramid (described at <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">382</span>, and<br/>
most conveniently visited in going or <span style="color: #0000FF;">returning</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Having <span style="color: #0000FF;">crossed<br/>
</span>the E. enclosing wall, and passed round the <span style="color: #0000FF;">RE</span>. corner, we obtain. near the closed entrance on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>side, a striking view towards the N. In the foreground lies the green valley of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile<br/>
</span>bordered by palm-trees, and framed on both sides with the yellowish-grey desert; and we also observe the alabaster mosque of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli </span>at Cairo. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left tower the three pyramids of<br/>
Gizeh, 9 M. distant, and the three nearer pyramids of Abusir. The<br/>
path pursues a W. direction for a short distance, then turns to the<br/>
right beyond the next heap of rubbish <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>N.W<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, crosses the hollow,<br/>
and joins the above-mentioned path leading to Mariette's House.<br/>
Strangers are quite at liberty to enter and use the broad covered<br/>
terrace in front of the house, but for any very protracted occupation<br/>
of it the permission of the museum authorities should be obtained.<br/>
No charge is made for admission to the terrace, but it is usual to<br/>
give a fee <span style="color: #0000FF;">oft </span>fr. or more, according to the number of the party,<br/>
to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>who take charge of the house, and who are much<br/>
better conducted than their rapacious brethren of Gizeh. A guide<br/>
to the tombs must be taken at Mariette's House, as visitors are<br/>
not admitted to them unattended. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Bakshish for the tombs of<br/>
