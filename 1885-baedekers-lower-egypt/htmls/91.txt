these seasons the wind, as is the case in all tropical regions, sometimes rises to a hurricane, in which case it is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'Samfim</span>'.<br/>
Of this wind there are two or three <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>varieties: <span style="color: #0000FF;">U</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is<br/>
called <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'Shobeh</span>' when it blows <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>from the east, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">[</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'27</span>) a<br/>
'Merisi' when it comes directly from the south. In the latter case<br/>
it is also sometimes called <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'Khamsin</span>', but this name more properly<br/>
applies to the very hot, dry, and dust-laden winds which frequently<br/>
blow unremittingly for one or two whole <span style="color: #0000FF;">days </span>together, and render<br/>
the climate peculiarly trying in March and April (comp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.'27</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The name Khamasin, as it is more correctly <span style="color: #0000FF;">written</span>, is the plural<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">I0amsiu</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">signifying </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ditty</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>and is applied to these winds in consequence of the fact that they prevail only during a period of <span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span>days<br/>
before the summer solstice, after which they invariably cease. The Arabs<br/>
confine this name to the period, and name the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Winds </span>themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">share</span>.<br/>

of the Khamsin of the hotter season, which forms the only disagreeable<br/>
feature of the Egyptian climate, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>from which there is no escape.<br/>
The impalpable sand finds its way into the most carefully closed rooms,<br/>
boxes, and even watches, and the parching heat is most destructive to<br/>
the blossoms of fruit-trees.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">accordance </span>with the TEMPERATURE the Egyptian year may<br/>
also be divided into two <span style="color: #0000FF;">seasonal</span>, a period of hot weather, lasting<br/>
eight months <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>April to November), and a cool season of four months<br/>
(December to March). Throughout the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>country the heat<br/>
gradually increases from April till the middle or end of June, and<br/>
many of the superstitious natives believe that a perceptible freshening of the air takes place on the night of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'dropping</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>17th<br/>
June; see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">939</span>). In Alexandria the blowing of the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. wind<br/>
sometimes interrupts the regular increase of the heat, so that the<br/>
maximum may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>reached as early as May or June or may be postponed to September or October. The maximum heat in the Delta<br/>
is about <span style="color: #0000FF;">050 </span>Fahr. in the shade, in Upper Egypt about <span style="color: #0000FF;">1001 </span>At<br/>
Cairo the thermometer sometimes rises as high as <span style="color: #ff0000;">114° </span>during the<br/>
prevalence of the Khamsin. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>December, January, and February<br/>
the temperature is at its lowest, falling in the Delta to 35°, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">40</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, and in Upper Egypt to <span style="color: #0000FF;">41°</span>. The quicksilver rarely<br/>

pools of water, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where</span>, owing to the rapid evaporation, the temperature falls several degrees lower than in the surrounding air. As<br/>
a rule, throughout the whole country, and at every season, the temperature is highest from 1 to 5 <span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m.</span>, and lowest during the two<br/>
hours before sunrise. The result of the observations often years has<br/>
been that the mean temperature in the Delta and at Cairo is <span style="color: #0000FF;">58° </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fahr</span>.<br/>
