(P1<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was restored by Edhem Pasha at the beginning of<br/>
the present century, we frequently observe <span style="color: #0000FF;">barber</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>engaged in<br/>
shaving the heads of the students with admirable skill, but we of<br/>
course avoid stopping to <span style="color: #0000FF;">watch </span>the process for fear of giving offence.<br/>
This being one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fountain-heads </span>of Mohammedan fanaticism,<br/>
the traveller should, of course, throughout his visit, be careful not<br/>
to indulge openly in any gestures of amusement or contempt.<br/>
Beyond the entrance, which forms a kind of fore-court, we reach<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flesh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Gamir </span>(Pl. 2), or Great Court, where the students are<br/>
seen sitting on their mats in groups and conning their tasks. This<br/>
court does not contain the usual fountain for <span style="color: #0000FF;">ablution</span>, but there<br/>
are three small <span style="color: #0000FF;">cisterns </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. 3) for the purpose. The arcades<br/>
enclosing the court have arches approaching the keel shape, but<br/>
the sides are straighter than usual. The openings and niches over<br/>
the arcades are less systematically arranged than in the case of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tuldn </span>Mosque (p. 265), from which they seem to have been copied.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the E. side, in the direction of Mecca, is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Liwin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elGimie </span>(Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, or Sanctuary, now the principal hall of instruction,<br/>
covering an area of about 3600 sq. yds., with a low ceiling resting<br/>
on 380 columns of granite and marble, all of ancient origin, and<br/>
arbitrarily arranged. The hall is entirely destitute of architectural<br/>
enrichment, and presents a heavy and sombre appearance. Here<br/>
again, as in the court, we observe various groups of students<br/>
in the usual crouching attitude, and others devoutly praying in<br/>
front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bibles </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on</span>. 5), of which there is one for each of the<br/>
four recognised sects <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Shife'ites, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Malekites</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Uanefites</span>,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hambalites </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">camp</span>. p. 149). The domes over these <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bibles<br/>
</span>and their walls are adorned not unpleasingly in stucco. On the S.<br/>
side is the Tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Ahd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-ftalyuiu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iiihhya </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">S</span>), by whom the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">8.13. </span>part of the mosque was restored <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d. </span>about 1750). To the W.<br/>
(right) of this tomb is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Riwah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see above) of the students<br/>
from Upper Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. 34), and to the left of the latter, on the E.<br/>
side, is that of the natives of Mecca and Medina <span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">28 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">N.<br/>
</span>side is bounded by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mesgicl </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gfihariyeh </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>), a smaller mosque,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the oldest part of the whole structure.<br/>
<br/>
After having inspected the great hall, the visitor is conducted<br/>
into a number of smaller apartments (<span style="color: #ff0000;">riwtlrsj</span>, some of which are<br/>
indicated in the plan of the edifice, but they contain nothing<br/>
noteworthy. There is also a separate <span style="color: #ff0000;">riwals</span>, called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zdteivet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elrOmydn</span>, for blind students, for <span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span>maintenance a portion of the<br/>
funds is set apart. These blind youths, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>have a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sh√©kh </span>of their<br/>
own, were frequently guilty of riotous conduct in former years,<br/>
and used to parade the streets armed with bludgeons, whenever<br/>
they conceived their rights infringed, the disputes being generally<br/>
concerning the quality of their food. To this day they are said to<br/>
be the most fanatical of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">seat</span>, and to entertain the most bitter<br/>
hatred and contempt for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">kafir</span>, or unbelieving Christian.<br/>
