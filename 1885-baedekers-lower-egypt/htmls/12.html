<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bfalmntrl </span>Bey, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Linant</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lrpsius</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kiepcrt</span>, together with<br/>
tl e English and French Admiralty charts, and the map of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">finch </span>expedition, so far as still serviceable; while numerous<br/>
corrections and additions have been specially made on the<br/>
spot. The plans of the mosques and the sketch of the Tombs<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>have been contributed by Fran: <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bay</span>, the<br/>
architect. It is therefore hoped that the maps and plans will,<br/>
on the whole, be found the most serviceable that have yet<br/>
been published for the use of travellers in Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
HEIGHTS above the sea-level and <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">measurements </span>are<br/>
given in English feet, from the latest and most trustworthy<br/>
English and other sources.<br/>
<br/>
The PRICES and various items of expenditure mentioned<br/>
in the Handbook are given in accordance with the Editor's<br/>
personal experience, but they are liable to very great <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluctuation</span>, in accordance with the state of trade, the influx of<br/>
foreigners, the traveller's own <span style="color: #ff0000;">dcmcanour</span>, and other circumstances. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>cases the traveller's expenditure <span style="color: #ff0000;">maybe<br/>
</span>within the rate indicated in the Handbook, but as many unexpected <span style="color: #ff0000;">Contingencies </span>may arise on so long <span style="color: #0000FF;">ajourney</span>, an<br/>
ample pecuniary margin should always be allowed.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">TRANSLITERATION</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>vowel sounds of Arabic words<br/>
mentioned in the Handbook are represented by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">c</span>, i, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">n</span>,<br/>
as pronounced in Italian (ah, eh, ee, <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, and 00). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>used<br/>
in the Handbook is a contracted form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ti</span>, and is used in<br/>
preference to it, as it exactly represents the usual <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronunciation </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">re</span>. that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>in fate). The diphthong sound of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ei </span>is<br/>
rarely used except in the recitation of the Koran. Arabic<br/>
words written in accordance with this system will generally<br/>
be found to correspond with the forms used by German,<br/>
French, and Italian philologists<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
