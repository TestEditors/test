rise from the plain. At several points on the coast of the Red Sea,<br/>
particularly near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koser</span>, at a height <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">6007950 </span>ft. above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-level</span>, we<br/>
find rock of the late tertiary or diluvial <span style="color: #0000FF;">era </span>containing coral, which<br/>
shows how much the land must have risen since <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">period</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>these<br/>
coral-reefs the petroleum wells of Gebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">ez-ZM </span>and the sulphur which<br/>
occurs on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">R55 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Gimsfih </span>appear to be closely connected.<br/>
<br/>
To the miocene, or middle tertiary period, belong several isolated<br/>
deposits of sandstone near Cairo, in which are found the beautiful fossil <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-urchins </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">CZypeastet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aegglptiacus</span>) frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>for sale near<br/>
the Pyramids<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The place <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>they occur, on the margin of the<br/>
desert, about 231. to the S. of the Sphinx, has been visited and <span style="color: #0000FF;">described </span>by Prof. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a8</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>One of the principal geological curiosities near Cairo is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Petrified </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Forest </span>(comp. p. 339). About 5 M. to the E. of the town begins the<br/>
Khashab <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'wood'l </span>desert, the surface of which for many miles is sprinkled<br/>
with whole trunks and fragments of <span style="color: #ff0000;">silicifled </span>wood. Few travellers go<br/>
beyond the'small' petrified wood; the'great' lies about 20 M. to the<br/>
E. of Cairo.'The desert here is so completely covered with trunks,<br/>
that, except the fine sand itself, no other kind of stone is visible than<br/>
the flint into which <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A't'colt'ae </span>have been converted'. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Frans</span>) Trunks<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">60-00 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in length and 3 ft. in thickness have sometimes been found.<br/>
These have been described by Unger as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nieiuirri1epypiiam </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the family<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Slerculiaceae</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, but, according to more recent investigations, it<br/>
would seem that the forest contained various other trees also <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>palms and<br/>
dicotyledonous plants). Whether the trunks have grown and been <span style="color: #0000FF;">silicitied </span>on the spot, or were brought here by inundations from the south, is<br/>
still an open question. At all events these remarkable deposits date<br/>
from the late tertiary period.<br/>
<br/>
Above Cairo, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s</span>, the Nile is flanked by ranges of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hills</span>, the<br/>
valley between which is generally 4-9 M. in width<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the east side of<br/>
the Nile begins the Arabian<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and on the west side the Libyan desert,<br/>
both of which are very inhospitable, being ill provided with water<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and<br/>
covered at places only <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>scanty vegetation. From the northernmost<br/>
spur of the Arabian desert (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam </span>near Cairo) to a point above<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Edfu</span>, both banks of the Nile consist of early tertiary <span style="color: #0000FF;">nummulite </span>limestone. The strata dip gradually from south to north, so that the farther<br/>
we ascend the Nile the older are the strata that we meet with. The<br/>
limestone of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam</span>, with its millions of <span style="color: #ff0000;">nummnlites</span>, is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">material </span>of which the new buildings of the European suburbs of Cairo are<br/>
constructed, and it was from the venerable quarries of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ana </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ma'sara </span>that the ancient Egyptians obtained the stone for their pyramids.<br/>
The blocks for these stupendous structures were conveyed to them by<br/>
means of a huge stone dyke, of which all trace has now disappeared. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hiokattam</span>, near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Minyeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bent </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hasan</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shit</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, and at<br/>
other places the limestone is rich in fossils, and in the vicinity <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofCairo<br/>
</span>geologists can easily form a considerable collection of them. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">quarrymen </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Molia.t.tam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>visitors fossil crabs (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Xanthopsz</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">PaulinaWiirtembergicus</span>) and sharks' teeth for a moderate <span style="color: #0000FF;">bakhshish</span>.<br/>
<br/>
To the south of Edfu the nummulite limestone disappears, being replaced by marl and rocks of calcareous and sandy character, which,<br/>
according to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Figari- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bey</span>, contain chalk fossils. After these we come to<br/>
quartzose <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandstone</span>, belonging to the middle chalk formation, and forming considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliffs </span>at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Selseleh </span>which confine the river<br/>
within a narrow bed.<br/>
<br/>
This last formation, known as'Nubian sandstone<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, which covers<br/>
many thousands of square miles of Nubia and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sad-2m</span>, was the material almost exclusively used for the construction of the ancient temples<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Upper Egypt<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and near Selseleh, and in the Arabian desert between<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Keneh </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koser</span>, are still to be seen the <span style="color: #0000FF;">extensive </span>quarries which yielded<br/>
the material for the colossal structures of Thebes.<br/>
<br/>
From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assnan </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Selseleh </span>the Nile flows through Nubian sandstone,<br/>
but near the ancient Syene a transverse barrier of granite and'syenite'<br/>
advances from the east, forming the boundary between Egypt and Nubia<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
