<br/>
A little before reaching <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iihedive </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tewfiks </span>palace, the road turns<br/>
to the right and skirts the garden belonging to the palace. It then<br/>
enters an olive plantation and leads in a straight direction to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyeh</span>. This plain has been the scene of two important battles.<br/>
In 1517 the Battle <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofHeliopolis </span>made Selim and the Turks masters<br/>
of Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>105); and on 20th March, 1800, General Kle'ber with<br/>
10,000 French troops succeeded in defeating 60,000 Orientals,<br/>
and in consequence of this victory regained possession of Cairo,<br/>
although for a short time only.<br/>
<br/>
Near the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyeh </span>are the Tree and Well of the<br/>
Virgin and the Obelisk of Heliopolis. The Virgin's Tree <span style="color: #0000FF;">tin </span>a garden<br/>
to the right of the road) is a sycamore with a decayed and riven<br/>
trunk, covered with names and inscriptions, but the branches are<br/>
still tolerably flourishing. According to the legend, the Virgin<br/>
and Child once rested under the shade of this tree during the<br/>
Flight to Egypt; and there is another tradition to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>that<br/>
the persecuted Mary concealed herself with the Child in a hollow<br/>
of the trunk,. and that a spider so completely covered the opening<br/>
with its web as to screen her <span style="color: #0000FF;">effectually </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">observation </span>The<br/>
present tree, the predecessor of which died in 1605, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not<br/>
</span>planted till after 1672. At the time of the inauguration of the<br/>
Suez Canal the tree was presented by the Khedive to the Empress<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Eugenie</span>. The garden is watered by means of a double <span style="color: #ff0000;">salsiyeh</span>,<br/>
which is supplied from a shallow reservoir fed by springs. This<br/>
water is good for drinking, while that of all the others, which<br/>
percolates through the ground from the Nile, is usually brackish.<br/>
This reservoir has been called the'Water of An<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>from a very early<br/>
period, and figures in the Coptic legends connected with the<br/>
Virgin. It is an interesting fact that the celebrated balsam shrub,<br/>
the balm of which is said to have been presented to Solomon by the<br/>
Queen of Sheba, once throve in this neighbourhood. The plant,<br/>
however, does not now occur nearer than Yemen, where its<br/>
juice is an article of commerce. It is said to have been replanted<br/>
here by Cleopatra, but apparently without <span style="color: #0000FF;">success </span>In <span style="color: #0000FF;">1820-30<br/>
</span>the first experiments with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plant </span>(p. 75), which now<br/>
plays so important a part in the commerce of Egypt, were made<br/>
in this neighbourhood. Quails abound here in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mouth </span>of April<br/>
<br/>
. <span style="color: #0000FF;">SO</span>.<br/>

famous ancient Heliopolis, or city of the sun, of which the obelisk<br/>
and the outer walls are now the only vestiges. The town was <span style="color: #0000FF;">tall-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ed </span>by the Egyptians the dwelling or seat of Ra (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Helios</span>), or of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tum </span>(the evening sun, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1'35 </span>], or house of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phenix </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Denim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>An. The latter, the popular name of the place, is frequently<br/>
mentioned in the Bible under the Hebrew form of On. Thus, in<br/>
Genesis, we are informed that Pharaoh gave Joseph the daughter<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Potiphera </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.'dedicated to <span style="color: #ff0000;">lta</span>'), a priest of Heliopolis, <span style="color: #ff0000;">named<br/>
