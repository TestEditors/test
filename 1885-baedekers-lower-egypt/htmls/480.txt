<span>422 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Route </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">6</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>THE RED SEA.<br/>
<br/>
large steamers is in the middle of the sea, which is free from these<br/>
reefs, but the smaller Arabian vessels always steer close to the shore,<br/>
with the configuration of which their captains are well acquainted, in<br/>
order that they may run into one of its numerous creeks (<span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span>) on the<br/>
slightest threatening of bad weather. The Arabs adopt the cautions<br/>
policy of never sailing at night or in stormy weather, unless compelled;<br/>
and when they are obliged to cross the sea, they always wait for settled<br/>
weather. In spite of the miserable construction of their vessels, shipwrecks are <span style="color: #0000FF;">accordingly </span>of rare occurrence.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">No </span>rivers fall into the Red Sea, but a number of intermittent <span style="color: #0000FF;">rain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">torrents </span>descend from its banks. The water is <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful </span>blue colour,<br/>
changing to pale green where there are shoals or reefs near the surface.<br/>
No satisfactory reason for the modern name of the sea has yet been<br/>
given. The difference between high and low tide is 31/2-7 feet. The<br/>
prevalent wind in the N. part of the sea, particularly in summer, is the<br/>
N. wind, and in the S. part the S.E. wind in <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. in<br/>
summer. The sea is therefore unsuitable for large sailing vessels, which,<br/>
when bound for India, always sail round the Cape of Good Hope.<br/>
<br/>
The coasts of the Red Sea consist of barren rock or sand, and are<br/>
almost entirely uninhabited. A little way inland the mountains rise to<br/>
a height of 4000-7600 feet. So far back as the time of Solomon the navigation of the Red Sea was of considerable importance, and several of<br/>
the seaports, such as Berenike and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Myos </span>Hormos, were celebrated. Since<br/>
the opening of the Suez Canal the sea has been regularly traversed by<br/>
the Indian steamers, which run direct from Suez to Aden. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic<br/>
</span>between the different places on the coast is carried on by means of the<br/>
Arabian coasting vessels (<span style="color: #0000FF;">rater-o</span>, barge; <span style="color: #ff0000;">sambalc</span>, vessel of medium size<br/>
with a short <span style="color: #0000FF;">cutwater</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>baghleh, the same, without cutwater<span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">den</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">dew</span>,<br/>
a vessel of considerable size with a prodigious development of stern;<br/>
rangeh, the same, with a long <span style="color: #0000FF;">cutwater</span>). Regular communication between some of the more important places is also kept up by Egyptian<br/>
steamers, which ply fortnightly between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues</span>, Jedda, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soufikin</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Masaura</span>. Steamers of the Austrian Lloyd and others also ply between<br/>
Suez and Jedda at the time of the Meccan pilgrimage.<br/>
<br/>
AFRICAN <span style="color: #0000FF;">COAST</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>On this side of the Red Sea there is not a single<br/>
place of consequence between Suez and <span style="color: #0000FF;">1505</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>. At <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gimscilt</span>, opposite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tar</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sulphur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mines </span>were formerly worked, and it was then a place of some<br/>
importance; but the mines have been abandoned, and the whole district<br/>
is <span style="color: #ff0000;">now </span>inhabited by a few nomadic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bednins </span>only.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>1200 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab</span>.) is the harbour of Upper Egypt, from which it is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">41/2 </span>days<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>journey in a straight line. It was formerly one of the chief outlets<br/>
for the products of Egypt, particularly grain, and was also the <span style="color: #ff0000;">startingpoint </span>of numerous pilgrims, but since the opening of the Suez railway<br/>
it has lost nearly all its importance. It was a place of no importance<br/>
down to the first decade of the present century, when, under the auspices<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli</span>, it increased to a town of 7000 inhabitants. It is now<br/>
a neglected place, as all the pilgrims, except the poorest, now prefer the<br/>
route by Suez. Even its grain trade, its only other resource, has greatly<br/>
declined, as steamers now convey corn to the Hejaz at a cheaper rate<br/>
than it can be obtained from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Keser</span>. The steamers rarely touch here,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>is carried on by native craft only, which ply almost<br/>
exclusively to Jedda, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Yenbar</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wejj</span>.<br/>

establishment, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">government </span>corn magazine for the supply of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">1.1'<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dakhirch</span>), and a telegraph office communicating with the valley of the<br/>
Nile. The town is a well-built place, crowned with a citadel, which was<br/>
erected by Sultan Selim in the 16th century and still contains a few<br/>
cannon dating from the French period and a mortar with the inscription,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'ifen </span>111 de la <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll√©p</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">francaise</span>'. In the distant background rise picturesque mountains, culminating in <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">AM</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>and AM Suba'a<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">420091.<br/>

Drinking water has to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>brought to the town in skins from the mountains, one day's journey distant<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
