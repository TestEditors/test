</span>usual resort of the family and their domestic animals in summer.<br/>
The walls of the yard generally contain round hollows, used as <span style="color: #0000FF;">receptacles </span>for the grain which forms the food of the family. Within<br/>
the yard are usually placed a square pillar, <span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span>ft. in height,<br/>
with openings in its sides as receptacles for objects of value, and a<br/>
thick column of the same height, terminating in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">platform </span>shaped<br/>
like a plate, with the edges bent upwards, which is used by the<br/>
proprietor as a sleeping-place in hot weather. The fact is, that<br/>
beneath an Egyptian sky, houses <span style="color: #0000FF;">are</span>' not of the same paramount<br/>
importance as in more northern regions, all that is wanted being<br/>
shelter for the night.<br/>
<br/>
The poorer peasants mode of life is frugal in the extreme.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>staple of his food consists of a peculiar kind of bread made of<br/>
sorghum <span style="color: #0000FF;">flour </span>in Upper Egypt, or of maize in the Delta, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wheaten<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bread </span>being eaten by the wealthier only. This poor kind of bread<br/>
often has a greenish colour, owing to an admixture of <span style="color: #ff0000;">beau-flour<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">ruaoum </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Grzecum</span>). Next in importance in the bill <span style="color: #ff0000;">offare </span>are broad<br/>
beans (<span style="color: #0000FF;">mi</span>). For supper, however, even the poorest cause a hot<br/>
repast to be prepared. This usually consists <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span>highly salted<br/>
sauce made of onions and butter, or in the poorer houses of onions<br/>
and linseed or sesame oil. Into this sauce, which in summer<br/>
acquires a gelatinous consistency by the addition of the universal<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bamia </span>(the capsular fruit of the Hibiscus) and various herbs, each<br/>
member of the family dips pieces of bread held in the fingers.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Both </span>in town and country, goats', sheeps', or buffaloes<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>milk also<br/>
forms a daily article of food, but always in a sour condition or half<br/>
converted into <span style="color: #0000FF;">cheese</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and in very moderate quantities only. In<br/>
the height of summer the consumption of fruit of the cucumber<br/>
and pumpkin species, which the land yields in abundance, is<br/>
enormous. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the month of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramada</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>alone, when a rigorous fast<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">observer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>during the day, and on the three days of the great<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">leiram </span>festival <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ugorban </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ileiram</span>), even the poorest members of the<br/>
community indulge in meat, and it is customary to distribute that<br/>
rare luxury to beggars at these seasons.<br/>
<br/>
The dress of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>peasant calls <span style="color: #ff0000;">forlittle </span>remark, especially as he usually works in the fields divested of everything. The<br/>
chief articles of his wardrobe at other times are an <span style="color: #0000FF;">indigo-dyed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton </span>shirt (<span style="color: #0000FF;">( </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">camhs</span>), a pair of short and wide cotton breeches, a kind<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cloak </span>of brown, home-spun goats' wool <span style="color: #ff0000;">{ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">zu'bz'tt</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'ubdyeh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'abu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>,<br/>
or simply a blanket of sheep's wool <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamlin</span>), and lastly a <span style="color: #ff0000;">closelitting </span>felt <span style="color: #0000FF;">skull</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cap </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Lilldflh</span>). He is generally barefooted, but occasionally wears pointed red <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aerbtsn</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, or broad yellow shoes (<span style="color: #ff0000;">balgliu</span>).<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">sh√©khs </span>and wealthier peasants, when they go to market, wear<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">wide</span>, black woollen cloaks and the thick red'Tunisian' fez (<span style="color: #0000FF;">tar-bash</span>)<br/>
with a blue silk tassel, round which they coil a white or red turban<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'immehh </span>In their hands they usually carry a long and thick stick<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">million</span>), made from the central stalk <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the palm leaf<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
