<span>418 Route 6. SUEZ.<br/>
<br/>
A little farther to: the N. is the mouth of the Fresh Water<br/>
Canal (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">400</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>, the flow of which into the conduits, as well as<br/>
its discharge into the sea, is regulated by means of a large lock.<br/>
The level of the canal is here 61/2 ft. above that of the Red Sea.<br/>
The large buildings to the N. of it are the English Naval Hospital<br/>
and the engine-house of the'Compagnie des Eaux.' To the E. of<br/>
the canal is the large camping-ground for the caravans coming<br/>
from Arabia, which sometimes number as many as a thousand<br/>
camels and present a most interesting sight. On the way from the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">kiosque </span>of the Khedive to the canal are a number of salt pools,<br/>
sometimes tinged red by innumerable microscopically small<br/>
crabs, which, in the morning especially, diffuse an odour resembling that of violets. The small neighbouring eminence is called<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>' Hill. Opposite, to the E., beyond the railway, is the<br/>
Arabian sailors' quarter, consisting of dirty mud-hovels.<br/>
<br/>
A <span style="color: #0000FF;">massive'Pier</span>, about 13/4 M. in length, resting on a substructure of artificial stone, 48 ft. in width, extends into the sea<br/>
to the S. of the town, leading to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">*Harbour</span>. (Boat thither,<br/>
see p. 415.) The foundation of the pier and of the whole of the<br/>
quays rests upon a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandbank </span>stretching out from the land in the<br/>
shape of a hook, and heightened by the addition of large quantities<br/>
of earth dredged from the S. end of the canal. The deposits of<br/>
earth thus made also enabled the canal company to embank an<br/>
area of about 50 acres, on which the arsenal, magazines, workshops, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>buildings connected with the docks were erected.<br/>
The pier affords a pleasant and interesting promenade <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>donkey<br/>
1-2 fr., according to the time), commanding beautiful views of the<br/>
bay and the mountains enclosing it. At low tide the outline of the<br/>
sandbank is distinctly traceable.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'The'Ataka </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lilts</span>. to the W. of the town looked as <span style="color: #ff0000;">if </span>composed of<br/>
a liquid mixture of molten garnets and <span style="color: #0000FF;">amethysts</span>. They were reflected<br/>
in the water at their base, the ebb of which gradually disclosed more<br/>
and more of the ramparts and buildings around the harbour and the<br/>
entrance to the canal. The lofty pier, carrying the railway from the<br/>
anchorage of the large vessels to the town, <span style="color: #0000FF;">overtopped </span>all the other<br/>
buildings<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the sandbanks, and the deep pools left isolated by the<br/>
retiring tide. Men riding on donkeys and camels were passing along the<br/>
pier, and the lower the sun sank, the sharper did their outlines become<br/>
against the glowing horizon, until at length they looked like black<br/>
shadows on a transparent golden yellow and violet wall of glass. At<br/>
length the darkness closed in, and the roads were shrouded in night<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the pier we first reach a small dock of the Canal<br/>
Company on the left, with a lighthouse (white light), beyond which<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">+ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Before </span>the construction of the canal the inhabitants <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Suez </span>derived<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>supply of bad water from the Springs of Moses, which was brought to<br/>
the town by camels and donkeys<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and they were afterwards <span style="color: #0000FF;">summer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>with<br/>
Nile water by railway, at a cost <span style="color: #0000FF;">ville </span>centimes per quart.'What a<br/>
notable day (29th <span style="color: #0000FF;">nee</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">team </span>was it then in the town's history when the<br/>
fresh-water canal was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Opened</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">life-giving </span>element flowed from<br/>
the desert into the town in <span style="color: #0000FF;">exhaustless </span>abundance! It seemed like a<br/>
repetition of one of the miracles of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mosess </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lt </span>Stephan<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
