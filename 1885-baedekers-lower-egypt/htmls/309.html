<span style="color: #0000FF;">Barrel-c </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">138299</span>), a <span style="color: #0000FF;">car</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>slave, Succeeded in raising himself to<br/>
the throne by setting aside <span style="color: #0000FF;">naggi</span>, a boy of six years, and great-grandson<br/>
of Mohammed <span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nasir</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>was proclaimed sultan in Nov. 1382, being<br/>
the first of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Circassian </span>Mameluke sovereigns (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">104</span>). His accession to<br/>
the throne, which had been the result of treachery and intrigues of every<br/>
kind, <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>exasperated the emirs that <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>conspired against him and<br/>
dethroned him in June, 1389. In Jan. <span style="color: #ff0000;">139</span>, however, after having <span style="color: #0000FF;">defeated </span>his enemies, celebrated his triumphal entry into Cairo.<br/>
During his reign the Mongolians under Timur and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osmans </span>under<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bajesid </span>encroached <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the frontiers of his empire, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Barking </span>was not<br/>
sufficiently energetic to resist their advances. He died in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1399</span>.<br/>
<br/>
These three mosques, with their three lofty minarets, present<br/>
an imposing, though not quite regular, facade. Opposite to them<br/>
is a modern sebil. Continuing to follow the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nahhasin </span>Bazaar<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">206</span>), which is generally enlivened by busy <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>, towards the<br/>
left, we come to another fountain with a School (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. 91), erected<br/>
by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">certain'Abder-Bahmr'in </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kikhya</span>, the founder of several religious<br/>
edifices (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">201</span>). An arm of the Nile is said once to have flowed<br/>
between the Tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">lialafin </span>and this fountain.<br/>
<br/>
Passing to the right of the fountain, we reach the beginning<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gameliyeh </span>street, the seat of the wholesale trade of Cairo<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">207</span>), the warehouses of which occupy the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohciias </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">257</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, or<br/>
inner courts, of this part of the town. The finest of these courts,<br/>
which present no great attraction, is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Okella </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sulfilcar </span>Pasha<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">7-1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, opposite the corner where our street bends to the N. The<br/>
entrance, with a kind of star-vaulting, and the court, with its<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">colounades </span>and mushrebiyehs, should be noticed. To the left, at<br/>
the corner of the lane by which we have come, is the Medreseh<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gametiyeh </span>(P1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">321</span>, with a late-Romanesque gateway, the original<br/>
form <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is scarcely now traceable owing to the restoration<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bedaubing </span>it has undergone. At the back of this school is a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-mosque</span>. Following the lane towards the N. for about 500<br/>
paces more, we reach a transverse lane on the left, which leads<br/>
to the entrance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gimf </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hakim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pl</span>. 43), erected at the beginning of the 0th<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>of the Hegira, on the plan of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gami</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>ibu <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tuldn</span>, by Khalif<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Hakim</span>, of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span>dynasty <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">102</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, the founder of the sect<br/>
of the Druses. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cutie </span>inscription over the E. gate gives the <span style="color: #0000FF;">date<br/>
<br/>
</span>393 of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llegira </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">AD</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>1003).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Eumkim </span>(996-1020), the third <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatimite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalil</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, succeeded his father<br/>
'Aziz when scarcely eleven years old. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>bigoted attachment to the Shi'ite<br/>
views (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>153), and his intolerance towards the Sunnites, Christians, and<br/>
Jews, rendered him unpopular with most of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects </span>of the upper ranks.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>the lower classes, on the other hand, consisting partly of Shi'ites and<br/>
partly <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Sunnites, he ingratiated himself by his liberality, his religious<br/>
and unassuming mode oflife, his zeal for the discipline <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>soldiers, his<br/>
rigorous administration of justice, and his persecution of the Jews and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Christians </span>But while he wore the <span style="color: #ff0000;">plainest </span>kind of clothing and prayed<br/>
daily among the people, be frequently caused his viziers and officials to<br/>
he executed from mere <span style="color: #ff0000;">capricc</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Down </span>to the year 1017 he was a benefactor<br/>
to the poor, but a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanguinary </span>tyrant towards the rich, the great, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">those<br/>
