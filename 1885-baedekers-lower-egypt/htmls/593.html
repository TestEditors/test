<span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">SARBICIT </span>EL-KHADEM. <span style="color: #ff0000;">10</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Route. <span style="color: #0000FF;">5'23<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khadem </span>(Khatem) is the ancient Egyptian word for an enclosed<br/>
space, a fort, or castle; and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sarbfit </span>(pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serabit</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>signifies a hill, or<br/>
peak, in the language of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bednins </span>in the peninsula; so that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Serabit </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Rhttdern </span>signifies'the heights of the fortified place<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. In<br/>
the neighbourhood copper and mafkat were formerly worked, and the<br/>
plateau was occupied with smelting furnaces, and a temple where<br/>
the miners and the overseers assembled to celebrate various festivals. The dwellings of the workmen and their overseers, and the<br/>
magazines, must have been nearer the mines, several of which in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">WAdi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nash </span>(see <span style="color: #0000FF;">below</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>still yield a considerable quantity of<br/>
copper. Most of the monuments on the plateau were erected by the<br/>
superior mining <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, who wished to hand down their names<br/>
and merits to posterity, mentioning the king in whose reign they<br/>
obtained their appointments, the mineral <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>mafkat and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ore</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>they<br/>
worked, the number of miners they employed, the zeal with which<br/>
they performed their duties, and the accidents which <span style="color: #0000FF;">befall </span>them<br/>
during their term of <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>. Victories over the native mountain<br/>
tribes are sometimes also mentioned.<br/>
<br/>
The large heaps of black stone in the vicinity, resembling the<br/>
slag from a foundry, are partly of natural form; but artificially<br/>
produced slag also occurs in the valleys between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sarbut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Kh'adeni<br/>
</span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nash</span>. The old mines were <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-discovered </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">ML<br/>
</span>Holland, a member of the last English Survey expedition, while<br/>
others had already been discovered and described by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Riippell </span>in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nasb</span>. It appears from the inscriptions that the mines of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sarbfit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Khadem</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>like those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wi'rdi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Maghara</span>, were first sunk<br/>
in the reign of Snefru <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>491) at an early period of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Prinizeval<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Monarchy</span>, and that they were worked for a still longer period than<br/>
the latter, and certainly down to the 20th Dynasty. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouche<br/>
</span>of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span>is also said to have been found here. The mines<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sarbfit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Khadem </span>must therefore have been worked after the period of the Exodus, while in those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maghtra </span>the name<br/>
of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, the Pharaoh of the oppression, is the last which<br/>
occurs in the inscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
About 3/4 hr. to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.E</span>. of the plateau are several tombs of the<br/>
18th Dyn. discovered by Sir Gardner Wilkinson, probably those of<br/>
overseers of the mines. At a distance <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span>. thence the remains<br/>
of miners' dwellings were found by Major Macdonald (p. 490).<br/>
<br/>
A visit to these monuments takes <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-a-day</span>. Those who desire<br/>
to make a thorough inspection, and to visit the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nash</span>, will<br/>
require a whole day. They should then walk from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Farbii.t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Culem<br/>
</span>along the hills to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dei </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nath</span>, at the entrance to which are a<br/>
spring, shaded by palms, some ruins, the traces of old gardens<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>and a quantity of slag brought from the mines, <span style="color: #ff0000;">11/211r</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'We </span>find here a number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">unusually </span>thick layers of earthy oxide of<br/>
copper, inserted in <span style="color: #ff0000;">wedge-like </span>form between <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>horizontal strata of <span style="color: #ff0000;">sand<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">stone</span>. At many places the metalliferous formation seems to be about<br/>
200 ft. in thickness. The ancient natives have driven shafts through <span style="color: #0000FF;">these<br/>
