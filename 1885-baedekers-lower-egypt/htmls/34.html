<br/>
expense for each member of it, while for a single traveller a <span style="color: #ff0000;">dragomau </span>is of course a very costly appendage.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>conclusion, we may add that most of the dragomans are fond<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">assuming </span>a <span style="color: #ff0000;">patronising </span>manner towards their employers, while<br/>
they generally treat their own countrymen with an air of vast<br/>
superiority. The sooner this impertinence is checked, the more<br/>
satisfactory will <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>the traveller's subsequent relations with his<br/>
guide; and the hints already given with reference to the traveller's<br/>
intercourse with the natives may not <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfrequently </span>be applied to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dragumans </span>themselves. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the successful termination of the<br/>
journey travellers are too apt from motives of good nature to write<br/>
a more favourable testimonial for their <span style="color: #0000FF;">dragoman </span>than he really<br/>
deserves; but this is truly an act of injustice to his subsequent<br/>
employers, and tends to confirm him in his faults. The testimonial<br/>
therefore should not omit to mention any serious cause for <span style="color: #0000FF;">dissatisfaction</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Information </span>with regard to dragomans (name, languages<br/>
spoken<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>conduct, and charges) will always be gratefully received<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dunes</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">It </span>is less important now than it formerly was to purchase every requirement for the journey before leaving home, as<br/>
the traveller can easily supplement his outfit at some of the modern<br/>
shops of Alexandria or Cairo. For all ordinary purposes a couple<br/>
of light Tweed suits, a few flannel and soft cotton shirts, a supply<br/>
of thin woollen socks, one pair of light and easy boots, one of shoes,<br/>
and one <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot'slippers</span>, a moderately warm Ulster orlong travelling cloak,<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pith-helmet </span>and a soft felt hat, together with the most necessary<br/>
articles of the toilet, will amply suffice. It is advisable, for the prevention of colds and chills, to wear a woollen <span style="color: #0000FF;">fabric </span>next. the skin;<br/>
but light <span style="color: #ff0000;">underclothiug</span>, with an Oxford shirt, will be found more<br/>
suitable to the climate than a heavy flannel shirt. Those who intend<br/>
making a prolonged stay at the principal towns may add a dress-suit<br/>
and a few white shirts. If a <span style="color: #ff0000;">muslin'puggaree</span>' he used for covering<br/>
the hat, it should be made to fall over the back <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>neck and ears<br/>
as broadly as possible. This favourite European head-dress, however,<br/>
invariably attracts hosts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">importunate </span>candidates <span style="color: #ff0000;">for'bahshish</span>'.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>travellers prefer the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fez </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">turbdsh</span>, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">red </span>cloth <span style="color: #0000FF;">skull-cap<br/>

tie a silk <span style="color: #0000FF;">kell'iyeh </span>(manufactured in Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">15-20 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, falling down<br/>
behind in a triangle<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">This </span>head-dress protects the neck and cheeks<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">admirably </span>against the scorching Egyptian sun, especially when a<br/>
folded <span style="color: #0000FF;">handkerchief </span>or a white <span style="color: #0000FF;">skull-cap </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">f.t0lityelO </span>is worn under<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">turhfish</span>. In prolonged <span style="color: #0000FF;">riding </span>tours, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-shade </span>is a fatiguing<br/>
encumbrance. All these articles should be new and strongly made,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>it is often <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">troublesome </span>to get repairs properly <span style="color: #0000FF;">oxe<br/>
