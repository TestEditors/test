The plain watered by the Rosetta arm of the Nile is extremely<br/>
fertile. A little to the N. of Kafr <span style="color: #ff0000;">ez-Zaiyat </span>the river describes a<br/>
long curve; and somewhat farther to the N., <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the W. bank, a<br/>
little inland, but visible from the water, rise the ruins known as<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ed-Dahariyeh</span>, a series of heaps of debris which mark the site of a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">town </span>of considerable size. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the W. bank, farther on, is the<br/>
pleasant village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nakhleh</span>. The village of (<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the<br/>

<br/>
The ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'is </span>is mentioned in history at a very remote<br/>
period, and as early as the 18th Dynasty it was regarded as a cradle<br/>
of sacerdotal wisdom. The goddess Neith, whom the Greeks identified with their Athene, was the tutelary deity of the place. She<br/>
was one of the maternal divinities, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">manifestation </span>of Isis (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">135 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>,<br/>
and was named the'great cow' which gave birth to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sum </span>She<br/>
was worshipped both by the Egyptians and the Libyans. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
Roman coins of the Saite Nome is seen a figure of Minerva with<br/>
an owl in her right hand and a lance in her left. It was this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">identification </span>of Neith with Athene that probably led <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pausanias </span>to<br/>
suppose that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pallas-Athene </span>originally came from Libya, to which<br/>
Sais was frequently considered to belong. According to an ancient<br/>
tradition, Athens is said to have been founded by Cecrops of Sais,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">andafanciful </span>corroboration <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftbemyth </span>is sought for in the fact that<br/>
the letters of <span style="color: #ff0000;">A-neth-a </span>and Athena are identical. Most of the<br/>
Greek scholars who repaired to Egypt for purposes of study went<br/>
either to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heliopolis </span>or to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sal</span>'s. According to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Plate</span>, Solon associated here with the learned men of Egypt, Herodotus obtained<br/>
much information here, and the fame of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'ite </span>knowledge of<br/>
mysteries was maintained down to a late period. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">26th </span>Dynasty<br/>
originated in the city of Neith, and its kings were <span style="color: #0000FF;">specially<br/>
</span>devoted to that goddess, to whom they erected monuments of great<br/>
splendour. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Uambyscs </span>also visited <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sal</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>after his conquest of Egypt,<br/>
and showed himself favourable to the temple of the goddess and<br/>
her rites. It is not known when the town was destroyed. It was<br/>
probably an episcopal see at a very early period.<br/>
<br/>
There is now no trace of the famous buildings erected here by<br/>
Amasis and others (p. 93), or of the chapel formed of a single<br/>
block of granite brought from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine </span>to Sais, which must<br/>
have weighed at least 250 tons. The site of the temple of Neith,<br/>
which was connected with the royal palace and with a mausoleum<br/>
for the Pharaohs of the 26th Dynasty, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eannotnowbe </span>identified with<br/>
any certainty. The columns with <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-capitals</span>, the tomb of Osiris,<br/>
the obelisks, statues, and androsphinxes, mentioned by Herodotus,<br/>
have all <span style="color: #ff0000;">ontirelydisappeared</span>. The sacred lake, however, on which,<br/>
