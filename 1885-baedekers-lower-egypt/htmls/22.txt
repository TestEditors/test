<br/>
PLAN. The facilities for travel in Egypt are now such that the<br/>
intending visitor may make an outline of his tour at home with<br/>
almost as great <span style="color: #ff0000;">ease </span>as for most of the countries of Europe. During<br/>
the travelling season, moreover, the weather is always <span style="color: #ff0000;">line </span>(comp.<br/>
p. 67), and never causes disappointment and derangement of plans<br/>
as in most other countries. If, therefore, the traveller from a more<br/>
northern region retains his energy in this somewhat enervating<br/>
climate, and resists the undoubted attractions of the'dolee far<br/>
niente', he will have no difficulty in disposing of every day to advantage.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Season</span>. From the beginning of November till the middle or<br/>
end of April there are but few days of bad weather in the interior<br/>
of Egypt; the prevalent temperature is that of a delicious spring or<br/>
moderate summer, and the few drops of rain that occasionally fall<br/>
will hardly be observed by the European traveller. The fertilising<br/>
inundation of the Nile (p. 57) has by this time subsided, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>face of the country smiles with fresh <span style="color: #0000FF;">verdure</span>. About the<br/>
end of April, and sometimes as early as March, begins the period<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khamsinw</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">U9</span>), a sultry, parching, and enervating wind<br/>
from the desert, prevailing at longer or shorter intervals for about<br/>
fifty days (whence the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tunnel</span>, though in some seasons it does not<br/>
make its appearance at all. <span style="color: #ff0000;">7 </span>Winter is therefore the proper season<br/>
tor a tour in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Those </span>travellers<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>however, who can endure<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fierce</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>glare of an African summer sun will at that season have<br/>
the advantage of seeing the extent of the overflow of the Nile, and<br/>
will find that <span style="color: #0000FF;">price </span>are then generally much lower than in winter.<br/>

</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">anmmoxs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>traveller <span style="color: #ff0000;">uanhardlybe </span>recommended to start<br/>
alone for a tour in a country whose customs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">language </span>are so<br/>
entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>from his own; but, if he has been unable to make<br/>
up a suitable party at home, he will probably have an opportunity<br/>
of doing so at Alexandria or Cairo, or possibly at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">I'ort </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id</span>.<br/>
Travelling as a member of a party is, moreover, much less expensive than travelling alone, many of the items being the same for<br/>
a single traveller as for several together<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Apart, however, from the<br/>
pecuniary advantage, a party is more likely to succeed in making<br/>
satisfactory arrangements with the natives with whom they have<br/>
