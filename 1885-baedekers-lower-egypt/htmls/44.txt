<span style="color: #0000FF;">mosque </span>These bazaars are generally crowded with customers and<br/>
idlers, and afford the traveller an excellent opportunity of observing Oriental manners. <span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">n </span>all the larger towns and villages<br/>
there are extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kln'ms</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">depots </span>of the goods of the wholesale<br/>
merchants, who however often sell by retail to strangers.<br/>
<br/>
The shop (<span style="color: #ff0000;">rlukktin</span>) is a recess, quite open to the street, and<br/>
generally about <span style="color: #0000FF;">lift</span>. in width, the floor being on a level <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mnggaba</span>, or seat in front<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>on which the owner smokes his pipe,<br/>
retails his goods, chats with his friends, and performs his devotions.<br/>
The inscriptions over many of the shops do not announce the name<br/>
or business of the occupant, but consist of pious phrases, such as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Allah! thou who <span style="color: #ff0000;">openest </span>the gates of <span style="color: #ff0000;">profit</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">!</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Allah</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">thou<br/>
</span>who <span style="color: #ff0000;">helpcst </span>us in <span style="color: #0000FF;">want</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>"Aid from Allah, and rapid <span style="color: #0000FF;">victory </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1'<br/>
</span>These and similar ejaculations are invariably repeated by the shopkeeper as he takes down his shutters in the morning. When he<br/>
leaves the shop <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>either hangs a net in front of it, or begs <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>neighbour to keep guard over it. The intending purchaser seats himself<br/>
on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastaba</span>, and after the customary salutations proceeds to<br/>
mention his wishes. Unless the purchaser is prepared to pay <span style="color: #0000FF;">whatever </span>is asked, he will find that the conclusion of a satisfactory<br/>
bargain involves a prodigious waste of time and patience.<br/>
<br/>
As a rule, a much higher price is demanded than will <span style="color: #0000FF;">ultimately </span>be accepted, and bargaining is therefore the universal<br/>
custom<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the purchaser knows the proper price of the goods beforehand, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>offers it to the seller, who will probably <span style="color: #ff0000;">remark'lmlil'<br/>
</span>(it is little), but will nevertheless sell the goods. The seller sometimes entertains the purchaser with coffee from a neighbouring<br/>
coffee-shop in order to facilitate the progress of the negotiations.<br/>
If the shopkeeper persists in asking too high a price, the purchaser<br/>
withdraws, but is often called back and at last offered the article<br/>
at a reasonable price. A favourite expression with Oriental shopkeepers <span style="color: #0000FF;">is'Mudu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">buhiW </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Linkc </span>it for nothing), which is of course<br/>
no more meant to be taken literally than <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>well <span style="color: #0000FF;">known </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tttt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bttak'<br/>
</span>(my house is thy house). When in the course of the bargaining the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">purchaser </span>increases his <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>in order to make a concession, he<br/>
generally uses the expression'min <span style="color: #0000FF;">shank</span>' (for thy sake).<br/>
<br/>
Nothing raises the traveller so much in the estimation <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofOrientals </span>as <span style="color: #ff0000;">flrmness </span>in resisting imposition; but even the most wary<br/>
and experienced must <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>prepared to pay somewhat higher prices<br/>
for everything than the natives themselves. The various prices<br/>
mentioned in the Handbook will give the traveller a fair idea of<br/>
what may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>justly demanded<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and will prove a safeguard against<br/>
any serious extortion.<br/>
