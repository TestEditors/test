</span>Among these were the French savants <span style="color: #0000FF;">MM</span>. Ch. Lenormant,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l'HMe</span>, and Emmanuel <span style="color: #0000FF;">de </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rouge</span>', the last of whom was the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>to translate with philological accuracy a hieroglyphic text of<br/>
any length, and the Italian scholars <span style="color: #ff0000;">JIM</span>. Salvolini, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ungarelli</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lloscllini</span>. The most distinguished English Egyptologists of the<br/>
same school are Messrs. Osburn and Hincks, and Dr. Birch, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who<br/>
</span>has compiled the first complete dictionary of the ancient language,<br/>
and has translated numerous inscriptions. The most celebrated<br/>
German Egyptologist is Prof. Richard Lepsius (d. 1881), the founder of the critical method of prosecuting <span style="color: #0000FF;">philological </span>and historical<br/>
research. Thanks to the discoveries of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">savants </span>and others of<br/>
the same school, the study of the subject has progressed so rapidly<br/>
that the time is probably not far distant when students <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>be<br/>
able to translate a hieroglyphic inscription with as great philological accuracy as the work of a Greek or Latin author.<br/>
<br/>
A glance at a single temple wall, or even at the annexed list<br/>
of the names of the Egyptian kings, will show the traveller that<br/>
we have not to deal here with an alphabetical mode <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">writing</span>, the<br/>
signs (about 2000 in number) being far too numerous. The ancient<br/>
Egyptian writings were based on two different, but intimately connected systems: <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>) the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Idcogrupliic</span>, which, by the use of well-known<br/>
objects as symbols of conceptions, sought to render its meaning intelligible to a certain class of the community; and (<span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>) the Phonetic,<br/>
which represents words by symbols of their sounds. Although we<br/>
cannot now trace the rise and progress of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic </span>writing, as<br/>
even the earliest specimens manifestly belong to an already <span style="color: #0000FF;">perfected </span>system, we may at least safely assert that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">idengraphic </span>element preceded the phonetic; for, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>child employs<br/>
gestures earlier than speech, so nations use a <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolical </span>form of<br/>
writing before they arrive at a method of expressing sounds. The<br/>
newer and more serviceable phonetic system must ultimately have<br/>
superseded the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ideographic</span>, although occasionally <span style="color: #0000FF;">calling </span>in its<br/>
aid as an auxiliary. In the perfected system, therefore, the symbols for sounds and syllables are to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>regarded as the foundation<br/>
of the writing, while symbols for ideas are interspersed with them,<br/>
partly to render the meaning more intelligible, and partly for ornamental purposes, or with a view to keep up the mystic character<br/>
of the hieroglyphics.<br/>
<br/>
The Phonetic signs are divided into alphabetical letters, such as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Is </span>a, J b, <span style="color: #ff0000;">m </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">g </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">c</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">x </span>f, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">syllabic </span>signs, such as<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Â®- </span>ur<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,9 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">li</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>, sch, <span style="color: #0000FF;">5</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mick</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">manor</span>, etc. The<br/>
<br/>
syllable signs may, in order to <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>their sounds with greater precision, have as'phonetic <span style="color: #0000FF;">complements</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>one, several, or all of <span style="color: #ff0000;">these<br/>
</span>sounds which the name of the syllable representing the sign <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
