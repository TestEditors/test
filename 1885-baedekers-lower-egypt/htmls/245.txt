</span>reach his horse's knees. His <span style="color: #0000FF;">horse </span>soon afterwards stumbled over a<br/>
dead body and wetted its knee in human blood, whereupon the emperor<br/>
was pleased to regard this as a sign that the unhappy citizens had been<br/>
sufficiently chastised. Out of gratitude, particularly to the horse, they<br/>
are said to have erected the brazen horse which was known as that of<br/>
Diocletian. That the horse did not, however, occupy the summit of the<br/>
column is proved by an ancient illustrated plan of Alexandria, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>Pompey's Pillar is represented with the figure <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">man </span>on the top. The<br/>
inscription, moreover, indicates that the column was erected by Pompeius <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, whose prefecture did not begin till A.D. <span style="color: #ff0000;">309</span>, whereas the defeat<br/>
and death of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Achilleus </span>took place about 296. The column has, therefore,<br/>
no connection with the story of the brazen horse, but was probably<br/>
erected chiefly in commemoration of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>gift of corn presented by Diocletian<br/>
to the citizens during a period of scarcity.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hear </span>the extensive cemetery at the foot of the column are several fragments of columns which probably belonged to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">211 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>. If we are to believe the accounts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Makrizi </span>and'Abdellatif, this temple was encircled by a colonnade of 400 columns,<br/>
and once contained the library <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>was burned <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rOmar</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Following the road a little farther, and diverging to the right<br/>
near a manufactory, we <span style="color: #ff0000;">shirt </span>the S. slope of a low plateau and soon<br/>
<br/>
reach the Catacombs (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. D, 7), about 1/2 M. from Alexandria.<br/>
From this point to the vicinity of the Serapeum <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see above) the sloping, rocky ground was honeycombed by a great number of subterranean<br/>
passages and <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chambers</span>, but as there is now a quarry here, all traces<br/>
of the ancient constructions will soon be obliterated. Several ornamented<br/>
sarcophagi are still seen lying about. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>workmen <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>coins, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>of the time of Constantine, for sale, and it is from that period that the<br/>
construction of the catacombs probably dates. One only of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chambers</span>, which was discovered in 1858, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">tolerably </span>preserved, and it is now<br/>
exposed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>owing to the fall of the stories above it. <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'e </span>enter by<br/>
a wooden gate, generally open, and descend by an ancient flight of steps<br/>
on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>side to a group of three chambers. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">side</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>we<br/>
observe an apse with traces of paintings and Greek inscriptions (Christ<br/>
between Peter and Andrew in the middle; on each side a <span style="color: #0000FF;">love-feast</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">r<br/>
</span>The vault opposite the entrance, with remains of tasteful decoration in<br/>
stucco, contains three recesses, the paintings in which represent (W.<br/>
side) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maries </span>at the Sepulchre; (N. side) Christ, like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian<br/>
</span>god <span style="color: #0000FF;">news</span>, treading on serpents, with a quotation from <span style="color: #ff0000;">P5</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">sei</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">B. </span>side) the Ascension. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>each side of the central recess is a large<br/>
Greek cross with the inscription at the four <span style="color: #0000FF;">comers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IC</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">NO </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill </span>[ Jesus<br/>
Christ <span style="color: #0000FF;">conquers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. These very rude frescoes probably date from <span style="color: #0000FF;">about<br/>
</span>the 6th cent., being doubtless a second restoration of the original, as we<br/>
still find three layers of plaster, one above the other, and each bearing<br/>
traces of painting. The third <span style="color: #0000FF;">vault</span>, a long chamber on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">B </span>side, contains sixteen recesses, which were once closed by means of <span style="color: #0000FF;">upright </span>slabs<br/>
of stone. A flight of steps descending hence to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">s.</span>, the outlet of<br/>
which is now built up, led to a lower series of tombs. <span style="color: #0000FF;">q<br/>
</span>We now return to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pane </span>de la <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonne </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pomp√©e </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">38</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>,<br/>
and follow the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rue </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">de </span>la Colonne back to the (1/4 hr.) Place <span style="color: #0000FF;">Me'he'met-Ali </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">218</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. corner of which diverges<br/>
