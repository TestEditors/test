labour and material. The subterranean chambers were first excavated in the rock, and then extended into the superincumbent<br/>
masonry. A small building, in the form of a truncated pyramid,<br/>
with very steep walls, was first erected. If the king died at this<br/>
stage of the construction, a pyramidal summit was placed on the<br/>
structure, and its surface was then prolonged down to the ground<br/>
by filling up the angles formed by the nearly upright sides. If,<br/>
however, the king survived this first period in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pyramid</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>history,<br/>
a new series of stones was placed around it, and the same process<br/>
was repeated until each successive incrustation became in itself a<br/>
work of prodigious difficulty. The filling up of the angles could<br/>
then probably be safely entrusted to the piety of the monarch's<br/>
successor. The annexed plan will serve to illustrate this explanation.<br/>
<br/>
The rock which in some cases served as the nucleus of the structure is marked a; the first part of the pyramid is b; on this was<br/>
placed the pyramidal summit c; the angles d were then filled up,<br/>
and a pyramid on the smallest scale was now completed. If time<br/>
permitted, the builder next proceeded to place the two blocks e next<br/>
to the blocks <span style="color: #0000FF;">d</span>, and above these the blocks f. To complete the<br/>
pyramid on the next largest scale, it was then necessary to crown it<br/>
with the summit g, and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">till </span>up the angles h and i. If, for some<br/>
reason or other, the angles were not filled up, the result was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">SOcalled'step-pyramid</span>' (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">382 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

</span>A <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmation </span>of the accuracy of this theory is afforded by the<br/>
ascertained fact,'that the more nearly the interior of the pyramid<br/>
is approached, the more careful does the construction become, while<br/>
the outer crusts are more and more roughly and hastily executed,<br/>
in proportion as the probable time for their deliberate completion<br/>
gradually diminished'. The smallest pyramids always consist of the<br/>
simple structure already described. The outer sides of the complementary triangular stones were entirely polished, except when, as<br/>
in the case of the third pyramid, the whole surface was to be, as it<br/>
were, veneered with slabs of granite.<br/>
