<br/>
(3) The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ahmedz'yeh </span>(sing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">alynedi</span>), the order of Seyyid Ahmed <span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bedawi</span>, are recognised by their red banners and red <span style="color: #0000FF;">turbans</span>. This order<br/>
is very numerous and is much respected. It is divided into many sects,<br/>
but of these the two most important only need be mentioned. One of these<br/>
is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shimzdwiyeh</span>, who play an important part in the ceremonies at the<br/>
tomb of Seyyid Ahmed at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tenth </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">225 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. The other <span style="color: #0000FF;">seat </span>is that of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Azcldd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">N011</span>, who are generally young men, wearing high pointed caps with<br/>
a plume of strips of coloured cloth, and a number of small <span style="color: #0000FF;">halls </span>strung<br/>
across their breasts, and carrying wooden swords and a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">whip<br/>
</span>made of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>thick plait of rope.<br/>
<br/>
There are also many other orders which it is unnecessary to enumerate.<br/>
The ceremony of the admission of members to all these orders is a very<br/>
simple matter. The candidate (<span style="color: #0000FF;">et-muNd</span>) performs the customary <span style="color: #ff0000;">ablutionl<br/>
</span>sits down on the ground beside the superior <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cl-mzn'shid</span>, or spiritua,<br/>
leader), gives him his hand, and repeats after him a set form of words,<br/>
in which he expresses penitence for his sins and his determination to<br/>
reform, and calls Allah to <span style="color: #0000FF;">witness </span>that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">will </span>never quit the order. The<br/>
ceremony terminates with three recitals of the confession of faith by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">murid</span>, the joint repetition of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fawn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">148</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and a kissing of hands.<br/>
<br/>
The religious exercises of all the dervishes consist <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>in the<br/>
performance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Zi'krs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Le</span>. pious devotions, or invocations of Allah; see<br/>
below, and p. 239). Almost all the dervishes in Egypt are small tradesmen<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">artisans</span>, or peasants. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Most </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>them are married men, and they take<br/>
part in the ceremonies peculiar to their order at stated seasons only.<br/>

<br/>
Some of them, however, make it their business to attend festivals and<br/>
funerals for the purpose of exhibiting <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iheil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">zikr </span>These last are called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">full-am </span>(sing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">mm</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">i</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">13</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'poor </span>men<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. Others again support themselves by<br/>
drawing water (<span style="color: #0000FF;">hemali</span>: see p. 248). Those who lead a vagrant life and<br/>
subsist on alms are comparatively few in number. The dervishes of this<br/>
class usually wear a kind of gown (<span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.t</span>) composed of shreds of rags of<br/>
various colours sewn together, or a shaggy coat of skins, and carry a<br/>
stick with strips of cloth of various <span style="color: #0000FF;">colon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span>attached to the upper end.<br/>
A considerable number of them are insane, in which case they are highly<br/>
revered by the people, and are regarded as specially favoured by God<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
