<span>of Cairo. PETRIFIED FOREST. <span style="color: #0000FF;">J</span>. Route. 339<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Numerous </span>huge trunks of a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">balsam-tree </span>lie in every direction among the sand or in the strata of <span style="color: #ff0000;">meiocenc </span>sandstone. The structure<br/>
of the wood is as follows. There are no annual rings. The wood consists of <span style="color: #ff0000;">prosenchymal </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">parenchymal </span>cells<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>variously distributed, the<br/>
latter having both thick and thin <span style="color: #0000FF;">divisions </span>Dotted vessels, filled with<br/>
cells, are scattered throughout the tissue, either singly or in groups, and<br/>
short in their articulation. These vessels are divided into chambers, all<br/>
the walls being alike, but the outer <span style="color: #0000FF;">w </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Is </span>are sometimes without these<br/>
divisions<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the radiating marks are prolonged by means of a series of 1-4<br/>
parenchymal cells. A comparison of the fossil wood with living varieties<br/>
shows that the vessels of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sterculia </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Astrapaea </span>woods are grouped<br/>
in the same way, and Unger therefore considers it probable that the wood<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nicolia </span>belonged to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Byttneriaceie </span>or to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sterculiaceze</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thousands </span>of these <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nicolia </span>trunks are exposed to view in the desert of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khashab</span>. Where the sandstone became disintegrated and in course of time<br/>
was converted into the sand of the desert, there the <span style="color: #ff0000;">silicised </span>trunks<br/>
were gradually disengaged from their sandstone bed, and they <span style="color: #ff0000;">now<br/>
</span>cover the surface of the Little <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khashab </span>for a distance of 10-15 miles,<br/>
and that of the'Great' for a far greater distance. Travellers who are<br/>
not familiar with the appearance of a vein of coal will be greatly struck<br/>
by the appearance of this formation, regarding which all kinds of fanciful theories have been set up. The geologist, however, will simply<br/>
regard it as akin to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coal-measures </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">meiocene </span>period, with this<br/>
difference, that, while the waters of Europe favoured the preservation of<br/>
the carbon and the fibre of the wood, the silicious sandstone of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Molgattani </span>converted the tissue of the wood into silicic acid. The climatic<br/>
changes, moreover, which have taken place in the region of the Nile<br/>
since the <span style="color: #ff0000;">meiocene </span>period are doubtless much the same as those which<br/>
must have <span style="color: #0000FF;">affected </span>the interior of Germany, where the brown coal is<br/>
chiefly formed of the remains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">balsam-poplars </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cypresses</span>.' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Fiona</span>)<br/>
<br/>
Crossing the plateau of the Petrified Forest for about 20 min.<br/>
more towards the S., we suddenly reach the <span style="color: #0000FF;">B. </span>slopes of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Molgattam</span>, through a gap in which, at a spot now concealed by sand,<br/>
a path descends past <span style="color: #0000FF;">table-shaped </span>ledges of calcareous marl, formed<br/>
by erosion, into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lthlt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">et-Tih </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span>more correctly <span style="color: #0000FF;">th'uli </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dughla</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>,<br/>
or'valley of wanderings'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the S. horizon rise the hills of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tum<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">405 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, recognisable by the old fortress on their right spur and by<br/>
two heights exactly opposite to us, of which that to the left somewhat<br/>
resembles a <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffin </span>in shape, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>that to the right is of semicircular<br/>
form. Crossing the bottom of the valley in this direction (8<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, we<br/>
perceive in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tara </span>hills the entrance to a desert gorge, bounded<br/>
by lofty and precipitous slopes. This valley extends for many<br/>
miles in various windings, communicates with the ravines of the<br/>
desert which begin in the Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khof </span>near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan</span>, and is abundantly stocked with the plants peculiar to the desert.<br/>
<br/>
We may return from the Little Petrified Forest through the<br/>
'Valley of Wanderings', skirting the S. and W. slopes of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam</span>, passing the Tombs of the Mamelukes, and entering the city<br/>
by the Place <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli </span>at the foot of the Citadel. Another<br/>
interesting return-route is across the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam </span>hills to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Giyfishi<br/>
</span>eminence <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">335</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Thence to the city, see p. 336.<br/>
