<span style="color: #0000FF;">2025 </span>passengers. A place on deck should be secured, if possible. The<br/>
passage from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'iliya </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kantara </span>(p. 435), where a <span style="color: #0000FF;">halt </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1/2-3/</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>hr. is<br/>
made for refreshments, occupies 21/2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">his</span>, and thence to Port Sa'id <span style="color: #0000FF;">ave </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">us.</span>,<br/>
or about 61/2 hrs. in all. As already mentioned, the large steamers take<br/>
16 hrs. to perform the passage between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues </span>and Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismaiiliya<br/>
</span>being about half way. They are not allowed to steam <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>greater speed,<br/>
as their wash would injure the embankments.<br/>
<br/>
The Canal is 160 kilometres (100 M.) in length<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and the E. bank is<br/>
furnished with posts at intervals of 5 kilometres. Near the stations,<br/>
which generally consist of a few wooden huts only, are passing<br/>
places for the large steamers' and'Gare du Sud'<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">respective</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>. The Canal is about 26 ft. in depth, thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">admitting </span>vessels<br/>
drawing <span style="color: #ff0000;">24-25 </span>ft. of water. The surface varies in breadth from <span style="color: #ff0000;">65 </span>to<br/>
120 yds., while the width of the bottom is about 24 yds. only<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>dues<br/>
amount to 10 fr. per ton, 10 fr. for each passenger, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">10-20 </span>fr. for pilotage according to the tonnage of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">vessel</span>. The use of the Canal is open<br/>
to vessels of all nationalities.<br/>
<br/>
The Isthmus of Suez, a narrow neck of land which connects<br/>
Africa with Asia, is at its narrowest part <span style="color: #0000FF;">701/2 </span>M. in width. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">h </span>side it is washed by the N. part of the Gulf of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sue</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>(Arab.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bohr </span>Kolzum, Greek Heroopolite Bay), the western of the two<br/>
arms of the Red Sea which separate Africa and Asia. The Isthmus<br/>
is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">low-lying </span>tract of land, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>part of which may be regarded<br/>
as a kind of continuation of the gulf. About halfway across it rises<br/>
an eminence about 50 ft. in height, called El-Gisr <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the'threshold',<br/>
p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">434 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, and dividing it into two nearly equal parts. Within <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>S. half, and adjoining this barrier, .lies Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Timsfih</span>, or the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Grocodile </span>Lake (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">43-1</span>), a little to the W. of which begins the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tttrntlit </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">413</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, a transverse valley, traversed by the Fresh <span style="color: #0000FF;">Water<br/>
</span>Canal, and now partly cultivated. Farther S. we come to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">belt<br/>
</span>of sand-hills in the region known as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">433</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, about<br/>
10 M. in <span style="color: #0000FF;">width</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and beyond them to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bitter </span>Lakes (p. 433),<br/>
consisting of a large and a smaller <span style="color: #0000FF;">basin </span>Before the construction<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canal </span>the deepest part of these lakes, the bottom of which<br/>
was covered with an incrustation of salt, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">9-1 </span>ft. below the<br/>
average level of the Red Sea. In 1856, before the water of the Mediterranean was introduced into the lakes, they covered an area <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>141/2 sq. miles. <span style="color: #ff0000;">letween </span>them and the Red Sea extends a desert<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tract</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12/</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>M. in width, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">21/</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>ft. only above the level of that<br/>
sea. To the N. of the barrier of El-Gisr lies Lake Balah, or the<br/>
Date Lake (p. 435), a little beyond which is Lake Menzaleh<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">435 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, originally a shallow sheet of'water, extending a long way<br/>
to the W., as far as the Damietta arm of the Nile, and separated<br/>
from the Mediterranean by a narrow strip of land only, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>there are <span style="color: #ff0000;">now </span>four openings. By the second opening from the E.<br/>
the harbour of Port Sa'id has been constructed. The numerous<br/>
ruins which have been discovered below the surface of this lake<br/>
indicate that its site was once cultivated land, sprinkled with a<br/>
number of towns (p. 435).<br/>
<br/>
At a very remote period the Red Sea and the Mediterranean<br/>
were probably connected, or at all events the former extended <span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
