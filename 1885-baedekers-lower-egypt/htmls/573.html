contains visitors' <span style="color: #0000FF;">rooms</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>beds. sofas, and a kitchen. If the dragoman has<br/>
undertaken to provide for the party throughout the whole journey, he<br/>
must make his own bargain with the monks, to whom the traveller may<br/>
afterwards present a gift on his own account. Those who have to pay<br/>
their own expenses, are generally charged at least 5 <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>day each for<br/>
lodging alone. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is healthier during the cold nights in these mountains<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>spring, as well as more interesting, to lodge in the monastery; but the<br/>
traveller will find it more independent and less expensive to camp in some<br/>
suitable <span style="color: #0000FF;">spot </span>in the lower <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Shuraih</span>, and thence to visit the monastery, the various heights of the Sinai group, and the'Sacred Places<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebeliyeh</span>, as the servants of the monks are called, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">excellent<br/>
</span>guides, and will accompany the traveller for a trifling fee. Sportsmen who<br/>
wish to shoot the mountain-goat, which abounds here, may apply to the intendant of the monastery, who will provide them with a suitable guide<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

</span>.Monastery of St. Catharine on Mt. Sinai.<br/>
<br/>
The only mention of Mt. Sinai in the Old Testament, after the great<br/>
event of the promulgation of the law, is in connection with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">flight </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Elijah</span>, who sought refuge here after having slain the priests of Baal on the<br/>
brook Kishon (<span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>Kings, xviii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>xix. <span style="color: #0000FF;">b</span>). At an early part of the Christian<br/>
period a number of anchorites settled here amid the springs of these rocky<br/>
mountains, and pronounced the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">miss </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>the Mountain of the Lord.<br/>
As early as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ith </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cum </span>they were terribly persecuted, and stories are told<br/>
in connection with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">DÃ©r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Arba'in </span>(monastery of the forty) in the wadi<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Leja </span>(p. 513) of the cruel attack which cost <span style="color: #ff0000;">33 </span>or 40 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cenobites </span>their lives<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">two</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">While </span>Mt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sect</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">afforded </span>a better situation <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>monastic settlements, Mt<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>attracted numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">anchorites </span>and hermits, owing to its<br/>
seclusion and greater safety, especially after Justinian, according to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">statement </span>of Procopius, his private secretary, and that of Eutychius (<span style="color: #ff0000;">8arid<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ihn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Brrtrik</span>, 9th cent), had erected the church of the Virgin already<br/>
mentioned and a castle, in A.D. 530, for the protection of the monks and<br/>
the neighbouring region against the attacks of the Saracens. The emperor is said to have been so dissatisfied with the site chosen by the<br/>
architect, that he caused him to be beheaded. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>justly objected that<br/>
the fortress was commanded by the slope of the valley rising immediately above it. The desire attributed to Justinian<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>that the slope should<br/>
have been removed, and the execution of the architect in consequence of<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">answer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'if </span>we spent the whole treasures of Rome, Egypt, and Syria, we could not level the mountain<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span>by no means characteristic of<br/>
so sagacious an emperor. The monastery might certainly have easily<br/>
been destroyed by rocks rolled down from the E. slope of the valley.<br/>
Justinian and his wife Theodora are also said to have founded the Church<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Transfiguration </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">boo</span>). The monastery was also greatly <span style="color: #0000FF;">benefited </span>by a gift from Justinian of a hundred Roman, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ahundred </span>Egyptian slaves, with their wives and children. From these retainers are<br/>
descended the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebeltyeh</span>, who still render <span style="color: #0000FF;">service </span>to the monks, but are<br/>
despised by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bednins </span>and stigmatised as'Nazarenes' <span style="color: #ff0000;">and'fellfihin</span>'.<br/>
Although originally Christians, and living under the supervision of their<br/>
monkish masters, they could not be prevented from embracing <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam</span>,<br/>
which they all now profess. In the reign of the Khalif'Abd el-Melik ibn<br/>
Merwan there seem to have been many compulsory conversions to <span style="color: #ff0000;">lilohanimedanism </span>which <span style="color: #0000FF;">cost </span>many lives; but the shrewd monks contrived<br/>
to ward <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>their Mohammedan persecutors, by pretending that they had<br/>
accorded a hospitable reception to the prophet on one of his journeys, <span style="color: #0000FF;">that<br/>
</span>one of the monks of Sinai had predicted his future career, and that<br/>
the prophet had given them a letter promising them the protection of his<br/>
followers. The document is said to have been written by'Ali, and to<br/>
have been impressed with the blackened sign manual of the prophet,<br/>
who could <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">himselfwrite</span>. Sultan Selim is reported to have carried the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">document </span>to Constantinople, after the conquest of Egypt, for the purpose<br/>
of enriching his collection of relics, and to have sent the monks, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">its<br/>
