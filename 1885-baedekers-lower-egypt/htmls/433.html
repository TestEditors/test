<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cincts </span>afford sufficient information with regard to the different <span style="color: #0000FF;">periods </span>at which its silent denizens were admitted.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOMB</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>are of two kinds, viz. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Malstabas </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">literally'benches</span>')<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flock-Chambers</span>. The Mastaba is a mausoleum of solid masonry constructed on the surface of the earth. Its form is usually<br/>
rectangular, and the walls slope inwards, so that the whole structure<br/>
forms a kind of low truncated pyramid. Many of them are built of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">limestone-blocks </span>of moderate size, and others of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bricks</span>. While<br/>
the pyramids are always entered from the N., the door of the<br/>
Mastaba is usually on the E. side. On the stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">door-posts<br/>
</span>generally rests the drum, a cylindrical block of stone, probably<br/>
in imitation of the round section of a palm trunk, such as still<br/>
usually covers the doorways of huts built of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mud </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>sun-dried<br/>
bricks. The drum usually bears the name of the deceased, but<br/>
rarely <span style="color: #0000FF;">his.titles</span>, which are often very lengthy. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Grand~children </span>and<br/>
other near relations of the Pharaohs, however, are distinguished<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">O<br/>
</span>by the added to their names, being a title of honour which<br/>
<br/>
might <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">translated-'blood </span>relation of the king'. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">door-posts<br/>
</span>occasionally bear a <span style="color: #0000FF;">full-length </span>representation of the deceased; and,<br/>
where there is no drum, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave </span>of the door sometimes bears<br/>
an inscription. The arrangements of the interior vary. At the<br/>
back of the principal chamber there is usually a monument with<br/>
numerous inscriptions, giving the whole ofthe titles of the deceased,<br/>
the names of his nearest relations, and a number of prayers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">generally </span>addressed to Anubis, the guide of souls in the infernal regions and the tutelary god of the realms of the dead. In front of<br/>
these monuments, and in presence of the family, it was usual for<br/>
the priests appointed for the purpose to perform the rites due to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">manes </span>of the deceased <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>139). Osiris is rarely mentioned by the<br/>
inscriptions, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">deathis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hardly </span>ever alluded to. <span style="color: #0000FF;">hear </span>the principal<br/>
chamber there is generally a niche closed <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>masonry, to which M.<br/>
Mariette gave the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">serdab </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>'hollow <span style="color: #0000FF;">space</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and which in<br/>
many of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mas..tabas </span>either contains, or formerly contained, a statue<br/>
of the deceased. Most of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">serdabs </span>are entirely closed, but some<br/>
of them have small openings in the wall, through which it was<br/>
probably customary to introduce incense. The well, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">perpendicular </span>shaft into which the body of the deceased was sunk, is usually<br/>
on the W. side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mastaba</span>; for it was in the direction of the<br/>
setting sun that his soul would cross the threshold of the next<br/>
world. The sarcophagus is usually an oblong stone box with a flat<br/>
lid, containing a wooden coffin tapering towards the feet, with a<br/>
human face represented on it at the head. Within this <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffin </span>was<br/>
placed the body, either wrapped in a cloth, or without any <span style="color: #0000FF;">covering</span>. There is here no <span style="color: #0000FF;">trace </span>of the careful <span style="color: #ff0000;">inunnnifying </span>process of<br/>
a later age.<br/>
<br/>
The ornamentation of the interior of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas </span>is very rich<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
