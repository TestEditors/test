chambers average 26 ft. in height, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>their pavement and vaulted<br/>
ceilings are constructed of excellent Mokattam stone. The passages<br/>
into <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>they open have an aggregate length of 380 yds., and<br/>
are about <span style="color: #0000FF;">10 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>in width and<br/>
171/2 ft. in height. Twentyfour of the chambers still contain the huge sarcophagi in<br/>

pieces of stone cemented together, have in several instances<br/>
been pushed on one side, and<br/>
on the top of some of them the<br/>
Arabs, for some unexplained<br/>
reason, have built rude masses<br/>

when discovered by Mariette,<br/>
had been emptied of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">contents</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with the exception of<br/>
two, which still contained a number of trinkets.<br/>
<br/>
Twenty-four <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the sarcophagi <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>of granite, but three of them<br/>
only <span style="color: #ff0000;">hear </span>inscriptions, briefly recording the name of the king by<br/>
whom they were erected. One of these sarcophagi bears the name<br/>

the house of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suites</span>, who gained possession of the throne during the reign of Darius and occupied it until the second year <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Xerxes<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>on a fourth sarcophagus, dating from one<br/>
of the later Ptolemies, are empty. The most instructive relics<br/>
found here were the'Apis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sides</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>or small stone votive tablets presented by pilgrims to the shrine of the bull last interred, and<br/>
which, it is said, could only be received within seventy days of<br/>
the sacred animal's death. These tablets during the earliest period<br/>
were attached to the basement of the small temple of Apis erected<br/>
above the vault, and afterwards to the wall which shut <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>the<br/>
vault from the main passage. As time rolled on, they were set<br/>
up at a still greater distance from the tomb, although, curiously<br/>
enough, specially favoured persons were permitted to place <span style="color: #ff0000;">Staluttllcs</span>, hearing inscriptions similar to those on the steles, near the<br/>
