adorned) may be purchased as a souvenir. Several <span style="color: #ff0000;">pipe-makers<br/>
<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">shib </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hi</span>) are also established here.<br/>
<br/>
The chief occupation of the pipe-makers is the boring of <span style="color: #ff0000;">pipe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">» </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">stems</span>.<br/>
Their primitive apparatus consists of an instrument resembling a bow<br/>
with which they turn a wooden cylinder terminating in an iron spike.<br/>
The string of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">how </span>is pressed against the wood, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">how </span>is moved<br/>
to and fro, somewhat like that of a violin, so as to turn the borer. Notwithstanding the simplicity of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">tooL </span>and although they merely steady<br/>
the stem with their hands, they execute their work with surprising rapidity and accuracy <span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-- </span>The same kind of implement is used by the<br/>
turners. The wood on which they are working is secured on two nails<br/>
in two parallel upright pieces of wood and turned with the bow with<br/>
the right hand, while the work is done with a chisel held in the left.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the bazaars for a short time, we may now turn to the<br/>
right, and follow the broad, newly constructed street to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bét </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e1Kadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">PL </span>2), or'House of the Judge<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. The appointment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ram </span>is<br/>
made by the government at Constantinople, and is usually bestowed<br/>
on favourites, as it is said to be a very lucrative post. In the large<br/>
court on the right is an open verandah, resting on columns with<br/>
early Arabian capitals <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">takhtu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bésh</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>186). Part of the building<br/>
still dates from the time of Saladin <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>1193). Within the building<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>the entrance to which consists of an open verandah, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">high </span>holds<br/>
his court on Thursdays. This court was formerly the supreme tribunal of the country, but its jurisdiction is now limited to cases in<br/>
which the law laid down by the Koran is to be administered, and<br/>
particularly to actions between married persons. The large extent<br/>
to which the court is <span style="color: #ff0000;">patronised </span>shows that polygamy is not particularly conducive to domestic harmony.<br/>
<br/>
Crossing the court, and passing through the gate opposite, we<br/>
next follow the windings of the narrow lane to the left as far as a<br/>
sentry posted by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Game</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'L'csuf </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gumati</span>.<br/>
