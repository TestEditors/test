<span>of Cairo. THE PYRAMIDS <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">GIZEII</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">J</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">349<br/>
<br/>
</span>His description of the Pyramids is borrowed without remark<br/>
from other authors. Thus he does not hesitate to repeat that embankments for the raising of the stones were made of saltpetre,<br/>
which was afterwards washed away, or of bricks, which on the<br/>
completion of the pyramid were distributed among private persons.<br/>
He also mentions <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhodopis</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mas't'tdi</span>, one of the Arabian Historians, says that the Pyramids<br/>
were built three hundred years before the flood by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sfirid</span>, in consequence of the interpretation of a dream which predicted the deluge.<br/>
Having assured himself that the world would be <span style="color: #0000FF;">repeopled </span>after the<br/>
flood, he caused the Pyramids to be erected, the prophecy to be inscribed on their stones, and his treasures, the bodies of his ancestors, and records of the whole store of knowledge possessed by<br/>
his priests to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>deposited in their chambers and recesses, in order<br/>
that they might be preserved for the benefit of those who should<br/>
come after the flood. According to a Coptic legend, he caused the<br/>
following inscription to be engraved on one of the Pyramids: <span style="color: #0000FF;">'l</span>, King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sfirid</span>, have built these Pyramids and completed them in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">61 </span>years. Let him who comes after me, and imagines he is a king<br/>
to compare with me, attempt to destroy them in 600 (years). It is<br/>
easier to destroy than to erect. <span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>have covered them with silk<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>let<br/>
him dare to attempt to cover them with <span style="color: #0000FF;">mate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>' A tradition recorded<br/>
by the same author resembles the German myth of the nymph of<br/>
the Lorelei <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'On </span>the western Pyramid is enthroned a beautiful<br/>
naked woman with dazzling teeth, who allures desert wayfarers<br/>
from the south and west, embraces them in her arms, and deprives<br/>
them of reason<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
'Fair Rhodope, as story tells,<br/>
<br/>
The bright unearthly nymph, who dwells<br/>
<br/>
'Mid sunless gold and jewels hid,<br/>
<br/>
The lady of the Pyramid<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Moon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span>)<br/>
<br/>
According to other myths the spirit of the Pyramid bears the<br/>
form of a boy, or that <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>man, who hovers around it burning<br/>
incense.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramids have been frequently <span style="color: #ff0000;">visited </span>and described by<br/>
Christian travellers to Palestine on their way through Egypt. The<br/>
spurious itinerary of Antony of Piacenza of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gth </span>cent. states<br/>
that he visited the twelve granaries of Joseph (the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramids</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and<br/>
the same notion was entertained by pilgrims as late as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ath</span>,<br/>
15th, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>16th centuries. It is worthy of remark that many of the<br/>
medieval travellers, even as late as the 17th cent., concur with the<br/>
most accurate of the Arabian authors in stating that they saw inscriptions on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Pyramids. Thus the knight of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nygenhusen</span>, a<br/>
pilgrim who assumed the name of William of Boldensele (14th<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, informs us that he saw inscriptions on the Pyramids in different languages, and he gives six verses of one of them in Latin.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Abdellatif</span>, speaking of the inscriptions on the Pyramids, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">no<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
