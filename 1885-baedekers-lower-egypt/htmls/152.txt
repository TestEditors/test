<br/>
</span>from which name an attempt has been made to derive that of the<br/>
Greek goddess Themis, like <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ma </span>is represented as blind, or<br/>
at least with bandaged eyes.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Govs </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span>THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osuus </span>AND <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isis </span>ORDER. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Plutareh </span>a<br/>
detailed account of this myth, which has been uniformly corroborated by the monuments, and which may be briefly told as follows.<br/>
<br/>
Isis and Osiris were<br/>
the children of Rhea and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Uhronos</span>, that is, of Nut,<br/>
the goddess of space, and<br/>
of Seb, the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>earth,<br/>
which, owing to its eternal<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rejuvenescence </span>and imperishableness, <span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolises </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">time</span>. While <span style="color: #0000FF;">still </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the<br/>
womb of their mother, that<br/>
is, in the bosom of space,<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">childreubocame </span>united, and from their union<br/>
sprang Horus. Typhon and<br/>
Nephthys, children of the<br/>
same parents, likewise<br/>
married each other. Osiris<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Isis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reigned </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">happy<br/>
</span>royal pair, bestowing on<br/>
Egypt the blessings of<br/>
wealth and prosperity.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Typhon </span>conspired against Osiris, and at a banquet persuaded him<br/>
to enter a cunningly wrought chest, which he and his seventy-two<br/>
accomplices then closed and threw into the Nile. The river carried<br/>
the chest northwards, and so down to the sea by way of the estuary<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of'l'anis</span>; and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Waves </span>at length washed it ashore near the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phenniciau </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">liyblus</span>. Meanwhile Isis roamed in distress throughout the<br/>
country, seeking her lost husband; and she at length succeeded in<br/>
discovering his coffin, which she carried to a sequestered spot and<br/>
concealed. She then set out to visit her son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus</span>, who was being<br/>
educated at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rum</span>. During her <span style="color: #0000FF;">absence </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Typhon</span>, while engaged in a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">boar-hunt</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">foundthe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bodyofthe </span>god, <span style="color: #ff0000;">cutitiuto </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fourteeupieces</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">scattered </span>them in every direction. As soon as Isis learned what had<br/>
happened, she collected the fragments, and wherever one had been<br/>
found erected <span style="color: #ff0000;">amonurnent </span>on the spot to its memory; and this <span style="color: #0000FF;">accounts </span>for the numerous tombs of Osiris mentioned as existing in<br/>
Egypt and elsewhere. Osiris, however, was not dead. He had <span style="color: #0000FF;">continued </span>his existence and his reign in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lowcrregions</span>, and after his<br/>
burial he visited his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>, whom he armed and trained for battle.<br/>
The young god soon began a war <span style="color: #0000FF;">against </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Typhon</span>, and was at length<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">victorious</span>, although he <span style="color: #0000FF;">did </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">succeed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ill </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">totally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">destroying </span>his enemy<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
