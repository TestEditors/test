<br/>
o the court, indeed, lost their primitive simplicity after their<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">esigners </span>had been brought into contact with the colonnaded courts<br/>
of Egypt and the Syrian regions, and the Columnar Court was thus<br/>
developed; but the Arabian builders avoided using or imitating<br/>
Egyptian columns. They preferred the columns or remains of columns of the Alexandrian and Roman period, as the massive proportions of those of the Egyptian style were less appropriate to a<br/>
light and open structure than the columns of the richly decorated<br/>
Corinthian order.<br/>
<br/>
They borrowed their <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornicings</span>, which they employed but sparingly, and their mosaic ornamentation, such as arabesques, from the<br/>
Byzantine models which they found in Syria and in the oldest<br/>
Byzantine-Christian <span style="color: #ff0000;">edifices </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ongypt</span>, and their pointed arches and<br/>
domes <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>region of the Euphrates. At the same time<br/>
they contrived to impart to their works a certain individuality <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>character, partly by the elegance of their forms and the preference<br/>
given to superficial over architectural decoration, and still more so<br/>
by the peculiar character of their ornamentation, resembling the<br/>
patterns of textile fabrics, and obviously imitated from <span style="color: #ff0000;">walltapestry</span>. Similar patterns appear also in their latticed windows.<br/>
their carved doors, and their diapered balconies.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Exterior </span>of these buildings is generally plain, consisting of<br/>
a lofty, rectangular enclosing <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>of quadrangular plan, but not<br/>
entirely without relief in the form of projections and indentations.<br/>
in the mosques there are usually minarets and domes projecting<br/>
beyond this general outline, and this is still more commonly the<br/>
case with the public fountains (<span style="color: #0000FF;">semi</span>) and the mosque schools<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">medreseh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>above them. The portal, on the other hand, and certain<br/>
perpendicular sections of the building of various widths, generally<br/>
recede a little, the latter a few inches only, being again brought<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">forward </span>immediately below the cornicing to the level of the facade<br/>
by means of a'stalactite' corbelling. In these last also the windows<br/>
are often inserted with little regard to symmetry. In the corners of<br/>
the projections thus formed, as well as in the other angles of the<br/>
building, we frequently find columns of marble inserted, or columns<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>out of the material of the building, and detached to the extent<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">three-fourths </span>of their thickness. The whole plan of the stone<br/>
facades, which is not devoid of a certain degree of grandeur,<br/>
reminds us of those of the ancient Egyptian temples, although the<br/>
Muslims were generally scrupulously careful to avoid every resemblance to the pagan buildings. The portal is generally the richest<br/>
part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Windows </span>are simpler, and less importance<br/>
is given to the principal cornice than the height and other dimensions of the building would seem to demand.<br/>
<br/>
The Portals consist of rectangular niches, of such depth as to<br/>
allow <span style="color: #0000FF;">room </span>on the left and right outside the door for the mastabas,<br/>
or <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-benches </span>used by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">doorkeeper </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lbawwab </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">door<br/>
