which may be added, if required, a tent to be used by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>party<br/>
during the day), and for each traveller a complete bed with clean mattresses, blankets, sheets, and pillows; each person shall have two clean<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">em </span>every five days, and clean sheets once a week. A sufficient supply<br/>
of water for washing shall be supplied every morning, and as much drinking water per day as the traveller desires.<br/>
<br/>
(The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>of Sinai carry the water in small, long-shaped <span style="color: #0000FF;">tasks</span>.<br/>
The traveller will <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>it convenient to have one of these appropriated<br/>
to his private use. <span style="color: #ff0000;">liullehs </span>are best for keeping the water cool, but are<br/>
easily <span style="color: #0000FF;">broken </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5</span>) The traveller's breakfast shall consist daily of eggs, with tea,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">coffee</span>, or chocolate; lunch shall consist of cold meat (roast-meat, fowls,<br/>
etc), and fruit; dinner, at the end of the day, shall consist of... courses.<br/>
(The travellers shall be provided with <span style="color: #0000FF;">orange </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span>and dates whenever <span style="color: #0000FF;">they<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">esn-e.<br/>
<br/>
</span>(The traveller may adjust the bill of fare according to his taste. As<br/>
the air of the desert is bracing, a liberal diet should be prescribed; preserved meats may also be stipulated for. Nothing is to <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>on the<br/>
route except at the monastery, where rice, lentils<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>bread, dates, and excellent date-brandy may be purchased. The dinner hour should always<br/>
be fixed for the evening, after the day's journey is over.<br/>
<br/>
It need hardly be said that wine and spirits are apt to make the<br/>
traveller drowsy in hot weather. Cold tea <span style="color: #0000FF;">quenches </span>the thirst better<br/>
than anything else. The bread which the dragoman proposes to take<br/>
should be tasted beforehand. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>bread, consisting of thin,<br/>
round cakes, is only palatable when fresh, so that a supply of European<br/>
bread should be stipulated <span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>An abundant supply of ordinary tobacco (p. 27) should be taken to give the attendants and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, but<br/>
the traveller should beware of being too liberal with it at first, lest this<br/>
attention should <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>demanded as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]<br/>
<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">O</span>) The Dragoman Y. shall provide a sufficient number of good and<br/>
serviceable camels; the riding camels <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see below) for Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>and party<br/>
may be tried by them before starting, and in case they do not suit, may<br/>
be exchanged for others. The same stipulation applies to the saddles (the<br/>
condition of which should be carefully examined).<br/>
<br/>
(7) In case of the illness or death of any of the camels, Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>and<br/>
party shall to no extent be responsible.<br/>
<br/>
(8) Neither the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dragoman </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Y. </span>nor the Arabs, who escort the travellers,<br/>
shall, without the special permission of Mr. X., allow anyone whomsoever<br/>
to join the party.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">9</span>) The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dragoman </span>Y. binds himself to conduct Mr. X. and party to<br/>
any point within Arabia <span style="color: #0000FF;">Petrz'ca </span>which they may desire to visit, to allow<br/>
them to break their journey, whenever, and for as long a time as they<br/>
may wish, and to provide each member of the party, when making excursions off the main route, with guides and luncheon. The Dragoman Y.<br/>
shall not, however, be bound to provide more than one dinner, and one<br/>
lodging for the night.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">tut </span>The Dragoman Y. forfeits all claim to payment for any day when<br/>
he is the cause of a stoppage for more than half a day; but no such forfeiture shall take place, if Mr. X. himself, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>weather, should<br/>
be the cause of the delay. Any accidents happening to the camels, or<br/>
difficulties caused through the fault of the Arabs, shall be reckoned among<br/>
the delays for which the Dragoman Y. is answerable.<br/>
<br/>
(This last stipulation is quite fair, as the Arabs in Arabia <span style="color: #0000FF;">Petraca</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>can<br/>
always procure fresh camels within a few hours.)<br/>
<br/>
(11) The day for starting from Suez shall he the ...th day <span style="color: #ff0000;">of</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.5<br/>
</span>for any postponement caused by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dragouian </span>Y., contrary to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wishes<br/>
</span>of Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span>and party, he shall be liable to a fine <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hstg</span>. per day.<br/>
<br/>
The CAMELS (p. 12) used for riding are of an entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>race<br/>
from the camels of <span style="color: #0000FF;">burden</span>, and are <span style="color: #0000FF;">called'llegba</span>', or in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Syria'Deml</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.<br/>
docile). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Demis</span>, properly speaking, are selected animals of noble<br/>
breed, and very superior to the ordinary camels of the caravans. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
