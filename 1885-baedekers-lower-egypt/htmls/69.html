<br/>
they possess no boats or other <span style="color: #0000FF;">appliances</span>, with the exception of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">spears </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-nets</span>, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">merely </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Uehthyophagi</span>', who pick up<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">shell</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fish</span>, octopoda, <span style="color: #ff0000;">orsmall </span>fish <span style="color: #0000FF;">thrown </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span>on the beach. Occasionally they make a prize of turtle's eggs, and sometimes succeed in<br/>
reaching the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandy </span>islands of the Red Sea where the sea-swallow<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">sterna</span>) lays its eggs. This poor mode of life of course has an <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>on their mental capacity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is not of a very high order;<br/>
but they are intelligent in their own affairs, and remarkably skilful<br/>
trackers, so much so that they are often employed by the government<br/>
in pursuing criminals. They are nominally <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedans</span>, but<br/>
they do not pray, or keep the fast of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramadan</span>, or make <span style="color: #ff0000;">pilgrimages</span>,<br/>
except on rare occasions. Nor do they, like orthodox <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moham </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">medans</span>,<br/>
fear'ginn' <span style="color: #ff0000;">and'ghfils</span>', but they permit polygamy, observe the rite<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>circumcision, and worship saints.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the Bega, there are numerous <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bednins </span>who inhabit the<br/>
steppes and deserts belonging to the region of the Nile, but beyond<br/>
the limits of Egypt, and range as far as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confines </span>of the heathen<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">negro-races </span>on the left bank of the Nile, nearly to <span style="color: #ff0000;">9° </span>N. latitude;<br/>
but with these we have not <span style="color: #ff0000;">atpresent </span>to deal. Among the Arabian<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>of the North, there <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>three important tribes in the peninsula of Mount Sinai: the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ter0bigin</span>, who carry on a brisk caravan<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>between Suez and Cairo, and claim territorial rights as far as<br/>
the banks of the Nile near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Basétin </span>above Cairo; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tihflya</span>, who<br/>
occupy the heart of the peninsula, between Suez <span style="color: #ff0000;">and'Akaba</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Suwdrkeh </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-'Araytsh</span>, to the north of the latter. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>Upper<br/>
Egypt, besides the Ababdeh, the only <span style="color: #ff0000;">lleduius </span>who occupy the<br/>
eastern bank of the Nile are the Beni <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wa.sel </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Atz'tni</span>, or<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hitwdddl</span>, who<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>however, have now settled on both banks of the<br/>
Theban Nile valley and are gradually blending with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>,<br/>
and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mttriseh </span>(about 3000 in number), who dwell in groups<br/>
among the limestone mountains between Suez and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Igerreh</span>, where<br/>
there are good pastures at places. Most of the Arabian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>,<br/>
on the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand</span>, who belong to Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">confine </span>themselves to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">western </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bank </span>of the Nile. They occupy the whole of this side of the<br/>
river from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayfim </span>as far as Abydus near Girgeh, and it is mainly<br/>
with their aid that communication is maintained with the western<br/>
oases, peopled by a totally <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>race <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">65</span>), who till the ground<br/>
and possess no camels, being probably allied to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Barbers </span>of<br/>
Northern Africa <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cone </span>of the numerous Libyan tribes mentioned<br/>
in ancient inscriptions).<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ileduins </span>of the North <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inherited </span>with comparative purity<br/>
the fiery blood of the desert tribes, who achieved such marvellous<br/>
exploits under the banner of the prophet, but the traveller will<br/>
rarely come in contact with them unless he undertakes a journey<br/>
across the desert. The loiterers who assist travellers in the ascent<br/>
of the pyramids and pester them to buy antiquities, which are<br/>
generally spurious, call themselves <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, but, even if <span style="color: #0000FF;">originally<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
