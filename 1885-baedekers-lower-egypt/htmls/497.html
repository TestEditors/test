of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Et-Gisr</span>, with a chapel to the Virgin of the Desert, a small Swiss<br/>
house, and a mosque. A flight of steps ascends to this point from<br/>
the Canal. In clear weather the view hence embraces a great part<br/>
of the Isthmus, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">frowning'Atilia </span>Mts. rising above Suez, the<br/>
majestic mountains of the peninsula of Sinai, the course of the<br/>
Canal, and the green expanse of the Bitter Lakes.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Canal is flanked with high banks of yellow sand. At the<br/>
next <span style="color: #0000FF;">passing-place </span>we obtain a glimpse of the desert. Near <span style="color: #ff0000;">ElFenldn </span>(at the 63rd <span style="color: #0000FF;">kilometre </span>stone) the Canal passes through a<br/>
cutting, and then traverses Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Batch</span>, from which it is separated<br/>
by a low embankment. We next reach <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Kantara </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C'the </span>bridge'),<br/>

forming a kind of natural bridge between Africa and Asia. The<br/>
caravans starting from the town of Salihiyeh, situated on the old<br/>
Pelusiac arm of the Nile, and the point where the chief commercial<br/>
routes of the N.E. part of the Delta unite, pass this way, and the<br/>
projected <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypto-Syrian </span>railway will take the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">direction </span>The<br/>
old bridge was removed by the Canal Company, and replaced by a<br/>
ferry. The station here contains several restaurants <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hotel </span>de <span style="color: #0000FF;">la<br/>

the son of Seti. To what ancient town these ruins belonged has not been<br/>
ascertained. A moderate day's journey distant are situated the extensive<br/>
ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium</span>, the celebrated eastern seaport and key to Egypt, which<br/>
now contains no objects of interest. The ruin-strewn Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>, and<br/>

Immediately beyond Kantara begins Lake Menzaleh, through<br/>
which the Canal is constructed in a perfectly straight line to Port<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id </span>(45 kilometres).<br/>
<br/>
'The brackish waters of this lake extend over an area of about <span style="color: #0000FF;">WOO </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MI</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">21.</span>, covering what was once one of the most fertile districts in Egypt, and<br/>
was intersected by the three most important arms of the Nile in ancient<br/>
times, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusiac</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tannin</span>, and the Mendesian. Among the numerous<br/>
towns and villages situated here were the important cities of Avaris, the<br/>
name <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, afterwards changed to Pelusium, is connected with several<br/>
important and stirring historical events; Tanis (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">452 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, situated on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tanitic </span>arm and on a canal connecting that arm with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mendesian</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>place where trade and science once prospered; and Tennis (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1152</span>), of the<br/>
ruins of which there are still traces on an island in Lake Menzaleh. Not<br/>
only has this vast tract been lost to cultivation, but the environs of the<br/>
lake also are in a miserable condition from long neglect... <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>have rarely<br/>
seen a more desolate region than this, which was once so smiling. In<br/>
the midst of the interminable expanse of sand, swamp, and water, the<br/>
only relief to the eye was afforded by immense <span style="color: #0000FF;">flocks </span>of pelicans and<br/>
