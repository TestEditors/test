<span>504 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">JO</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">MONASTERY </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>SINAI. From Sue:<br/>
<br/>
stead, a copy authenticated by his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">seal</span>; this copy is also said to have<br/>
been lost, but another copy of very doubtful <span style="color: #0000FF;">genuineness </span>is now preserved<br/>
in the monastery of the order at Cairo. The safety of the monks is now<br/>
better secured by a letter <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">protection </span>accorded to them by each new sultan.<br/>
The mosque, which stands within the walls of the monastery, is said to<br/>
have been built in order to induce Sultan Selim (<span style="color: #ff0000;">( </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">AD</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>1520) to abstain<br/>
from his purpose of destroying the monastery, within the walls of which<br/>
a young Greek priest, to whom he was attached, had died. The mosque,<br/>
however, has been proved to have existed at least a century and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ahalfcarlier </span>than the reign of Selim, having doubt less been built out of consideration for the Muslims<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>whom it was absolutely necessary to conciliate. So far<br/>
was this policy carried, that when King Baldwin 1. of Jerusalem wished to<br/>
visit Mt. Sinai during the Crusades, at the beginning of the 12th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>,<br/>
the monks entreated him to give up his intention, as such a visit might<br/>
excite the suspicion of the Muslim rulers, and prove detrimental to the<br/>
monastery. Several Beduin tribes of the peninsula were constituted the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">well-paid'Ghafirs</span>', or guardians of the monastery, one of their duties<br/>
being to escort the caravans of pilgrims, a great number of whom <span style="color: #0000FF;">visited </span>the sacred places in the middle ages. The Egyptian government also,<br/>
even during the Mameluke period, entered into friendly relations with<br/>
the monks, partly in consequence of the pretended letter of the prophet<br/>
which they possessed, partly for the sake of ensuring the safety of the<br/>
Mecca pilgrims, whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">mute </span>passed the territory of the monks, and partly<br/>
from its desire to protect those places which were regarded as sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>Christians and Muslims alike. Down to the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli</span>,<br/>
whose patronage they enjoyed, the monks were entitled to part of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">custom-house </span>dues levied at Cairo, and that city had to supply them with<br/>
the materials for their gowns; and they still enjoy the privilege of conveying their property to or from Cairo free of duty<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Abhas </span>Pasha visited Mt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Sinai in <span style="color: #0000FF;">18531 </span>and formed the extravagant plan of building himself a villa on a rock of Mt. Horeb (p. 510), but he was assassinated in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1854 </span>before his design could he carried out. Although <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fanatical </span>Muslim, he did not <span style="color: #0000FF;">sample </span>to pray in the church of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Transfiguration </span>at the<br/>
'Place of the Burning <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bush</span>'. The safety of the monks is now perfectly<br/>
insured, partly owing to the favour shown to the Christians by the Egyptian government, and partly to the protection of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Russia</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Notwithstanding <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ample revenues of the monastery, the number of the monks<br/>
has greatly diminished. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lith </span>cent. it is said to have contained<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">3400 </span>inmates, together with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">prelate </span>and an archbishop, but the number<br/>
is now reduced to 20-30 only, who are <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>natives of the Greek islands, where the monastery possesses estates, particularly in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Drew </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Cyprus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The most famous offshoot <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the monastery of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">wan<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Shu'aib </span>is that of the Sinaites at Cairo, but the monks also maintain<br/>
constant communication with the other churches of their order, which<br/>
are scattered over a great part of the East. Thus we find fraternities in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Roumania</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Servia, Turkey (Constantinople), the Greek Archipelago, in<br/>
Greece itself, and even in India, closely connected with the monastery<br/>
of Mt. Sinai. The order belongs to the orthodox Greek church, which<br/>
regards Sinai as no less sacred than Jerusalem.<br/>
<br/>
The Monastic <span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>is very strict. The monks are prohibited from<br/>
partaking <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meat </span>or wine, and even oil is forbidden during the long<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">taste</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>they are permitted to eat fish, and to drink an excellent <span style="color: #0000FF;">liqueur </span>which they prepare from dates <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Araki</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. They assemble for prayer<br/>
twice during the day, and twice during the night. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Women </span>were formerly<br/>
rigorously excluded, and even <span style="color: #0000FF;">eats </span>and hens, as belonging to the same<br/>
obnoxious sex. Female pilgrims, however, and enterprising lady tourists,<br/>
are now lodged without difficulty in the rooms set apart for visitors.<br/>
The monastery is presided over by an archbishop, who is <span style="color: #0000FF;">elected </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the<br/>
monks here and their brethren in Cairo; the election, however, requires<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmation </span>by the patriarch <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jerusalem</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>who recently exercised his right<br/>
of veto in a very emphatic manner. Between <span style="color: #ff0000;">1750 </span>and 1872 no archbishop<br/>
resided on Mt. Sinai, as, in accordance with ancient treaties, large <span style="color: #ff0000;">sums<br/>
</span>had to be paid and gifts presented to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">installation<br/>
