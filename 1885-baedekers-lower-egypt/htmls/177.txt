</span>he marriage-contract is now complete. Before the wedding the<br/>
bride is conducted in gala attire and with great ceremony to the<br/>
bath. This procession is <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">We/ret </span>cl <span style="color: #ff0000;">ytrrnvrrfrrt</span>'. It is headed<br/>
by several musicians with hautbois and drums; these are followed<br/>
by several married friends and relations of the bride in pairs, and<br/>
after these come a number of young girls. The bride is entirely concealed by the clothing she wears, being usually enveloped from head<br/>
to foot in a cashmere shawl, and wearing on her head a small cap, or<br/>
crown, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">pasteboard</span>. The procession moves very slowly, and another<br/>
body of musicians brings up the rear. The hideous shrieks of joy<br/>
which women <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>lower classes utter on the occurrence of any <span style="color: #0000FF;">sensational </span>event are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">sagltfrft</span>. The bride is afterwards conducted<br/>
with the same formalities to the house of her husband.<br/>
<br/>
The ceremonies observed at funerals are not less remarkable<br/>
than those which attend weddings. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>the death occurs in the morning, the funeral takes place the same day; but <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the evening,<br/>
it is postponed till next day. The body is washed and mourned<br/>
over by the family and the professional mourning women (<span style="color: #ff0000;">neddfihalls</span>; a custom prohibited by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed</span>, but one dating from the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">&</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'motest </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit-Ni</span>, or schoolmaster, reads several <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strees<br/>
</span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>by its side; after this, it is wrapped in its winding<br/>
sheet, <span style="color: #0000FF;">plated </span>on the bier, covered with a red or green cloth, and<br/>
then carried forth in solemn procession. The foremost persons in<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cort√©ge </span>are usually six or more poor, and generally blind, men,<br/>
who walk in <span style="color: #0000FF;">two</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>or threes at a slow pace, chanting the <span style="color: #0000FF;">creed'There </span>is no God but God; Mohammed is the ambassador of God;<br/>
God be gracious to him and preserve him <span style="color: #0000FF;">y </span>These are followed by<br/>
several male relatives of the deceased, and sometimes by a number<br/>
of dervishes with the flags of their order, and then by three or more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">schoolboys</span>, one of whom carries a copy of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koran</span>, or of parts of<br/>
it, on a stand made of palm-branches, covered with a cloth. The<br/>
boys usually chant in a loud and shrill voice several passages from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Hashriych</span>', a poem describing the last judgment. The bier,<br/>
with the head of the deceased foremost, comes next, being borne<br/>
by three or four of his friends, who are relieved from time to time<br/>
by others. After the bier come the relations and friends in their<br/>
everyday attire, and the female relatives, with dishevelled hair,<br/>
sobbing aloud, and frequently accompanied by professional mourning women, whose business it is to extol the merits <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>deceased.<br/>
If <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>deceased was the husband or father of the family<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>one of the<br/>
cries <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'O </span>thou camel of my house', the camel being the emblem<br/>
of the bread-winner of the household.<br/>
<br/>
The body is first carried into that mosque for whose patron<br/>
saints the relatives entertain the greatest veneration, and prayers<br/>
are there offered on its behalf. After the bier has been placed in<br/>
front of the tomb of the saint, and prayers and chants have again<br/>
been recited, the procession is formed anew and moves towards <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
