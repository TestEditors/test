The first chamber usually contains <span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">executed </span>basreliefs, mostly<br/>
coloured, of members of the family of the deceased, and short inscriptions in the simple <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>of that period, with their<br/>
scanty determinative symbols, recording the dignities of the deceased, and mentioning the estates from which his faithful servants<br/>
have brought offerings to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">manes </span>of their master. Other chambers<br/>
contain carefully arranged lists of the appropriate offerings to be<br/>
presented to the deceased at different seasons, and on the various<br/>
festivals, such as meat and poultry, vegetables and fruit, drinks<br/>
and essences; and adjoining these are represented the altars laden<br/>
with these gifts. We seldom find any allusion to death, or the life<br/>
in the next world, but there are generally faithful representations<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">favourite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pursuits </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">deeeased </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bird</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">catching</span>, fishing, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>,<br/>
of his most valuable possessions <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">horde </span>of cattle, ships, <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>.; but<br/>
curiously enough, neither camels, sheep, <span style="color: #0000FF;">nor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">horses</span>, which last seem<br/>
to have been introduced by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ikasosj</span>), and the tasks performed<br/>
by his servants <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>agricultural operations, vintage, carpentering,<br/>
glass-blowing, <span style="color: #0000FF;">gold-washing</span>, papyrus-gathering, writing, etc<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
</span>These coloured basreliefs form a most interesting link in the<br/>
history of ancient art, and are not without <span style="color: #0000FF;">aesthetic </span>attraction also.<br/>
They constitute, as it were, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">picture-book </span>in stone, illustrative of<br/>
the manners and customs which prevailed during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">earnest </span>known<br/>
stage of human civilisation.<br/>
<br/>
'If we enquire into the motives of these primordial inhabitants of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Nile Valley in decorating the walls of their tombs with these curious<br/>
scenes, it would appear that they intended to hand down to posterity a<br/>
record of the earliest achievements of mankind in the province <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">art</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>and civilisation. Having hardly emerged from the simplicity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eval </span>condition, they seem to have been proud of displaying the<br/>
results of their peaceful conquests <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>the animate and inanimate<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">world </span>around them, and to have been desirous of informing posterity<br/>
of these triumphs. At that remote epoch, to behold was to admire. The<br/>
chief occupation of the period was apparently to embellish the tombs in<br/>
the best possible manner, and it is these decorations which constitute the<br/>
pictorial history of primitive Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>- <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brugsch</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Those </span>tombs probably originated somewhat in the following<br/>
manner. Every Egyptian of moderate means, and particularly the<br/>
great and wealthy, began during his lifetime to plan the <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>of a tomb worthy of his position in society. The longer<br/>
he lived and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>wealthier he <span style="color: #0000FF;">botanic</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">handsome</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>and the<br/>
more spacious was the structure. When the architect had lined the<br/>
interior with smoothly hewn stones from the quarries <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'l'ura</span>, the<br/>
task of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">draughtsman </span>and the decorator began. In accordance<br/>
with certain rules regarding the objects to be represented and<br/>
their grouping, which seem to have been followed in all the tombs<br/>
of a similar kind, or perhaps according to well-defined patterns,<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">draughtsxnan </span>first proceeded to divide the walls into sections<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>sizes, and sometimes into regular <span style="color: #ff0000;">squares</span>, with red<br/>
chalk, and then to fill them up with sketches of the representations<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphies </span>with which the tomb was to be adorned. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
