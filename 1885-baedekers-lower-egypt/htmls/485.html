<br/>
verged to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>interior of the Delta. Three other roads, one from<br/>
Mt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Casiust </span>leading to the E., the second from Gerrha, and the<br/>
third from Pelusium, converged in the middle of the isthmus (probably near the barrier of <span style="color: #0000FF;">E1-Gisr</span>), joining the route leading thence<br/>
past the Serapeum and the W. bank of the Bitter Lakes to the ancient<br/>
Arsinoe, at the N. end of the Gulf of Suez. The Mediterranean<br/>
was thus connected with the Red Sea by an overland route at a<br/>
very early period. After the powerful monarchs of Thebes had expelled the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos </span>and subjugated a great part of the W. side of the<br/>
continent of Asia, the coast districts of S. Arabia, and many islands and maritime towns of the Mediterranean, Seti I. and<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>90), the great and warlike princes of the 19th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dynasty</span>, became desirous of establishing communication by water<br/>
between the Nile and the Red Sea in order that their navies and<br/>
merchantmen might thus pass between the latter and the Mediterranean. This project was probably carried out as early as the<br/>
reign of Seti L, as a representation of his time on the outer N.<br/>
wall of the great banquet hall of Karnak (see vol. ii. of the Handbook), elucidated by inscriptions, informs us that, on his victorious<br/>
return from Asia, Seti had to traverse a canal <span style="color: #0000FF;">U41 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lentil</span>, or'the<br/>
cutting<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>) swarming with crocodiles <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>so that it must have communicated with the Nile), and defended by bastions, the names of<br/>
which distinctly indicate that it must have been situated on the<br/>
frontier of the empire. The construction of the canal is, moreover,<br/>
attributed by many ancient authors, including Herodotus, Aristotle,<br/>
Strabo, and Pliny, to Sesostris <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Seti I. and Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">11</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. The canal may possibly have led from Lake Timsah to Pelusium, and thus<br/>
have connected the two seas directly. Blocks bearing the names of<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and Ramses 11., found near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kantara </span>(p. 435),<br/>
seem to favour this conjecture. At a much later period, after Seti's<br/>
canal had probably been obliterated owing to neglect, Pharaoh<br/>
Nekho (p. 9'2) undertook to construct a canal between the Nile<br/>
and the Red Sea. The new canal quitted the Nile at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastis<br/>
</span>(p. 410), and entered the Arabian Gulf near the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Patnmos</span>.<br/>
No fewer than 120,000 Egyptians perished while engaged in<br/>
the work, and the king afterwards abandoned the work, as<br/>
he was informed by the oracle that the barbarians alone would<br/>
profit by the work. By the'barbarians' were <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>meant the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Phoenicians</span>, whose fleets at that time commanded both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The canal was probably completed,<br/>
after the conquest of Egypt by the Persians, by Darius, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">son </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hystaspes</span>, the great organiser of the Persian empire, and not by<br/>
Ptolemy Philadelphus, as stated by some authors. Numerous traces<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">r </span>Brugsch mentions that another route traversed the desert of Shur<br/>
(to the S. of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbonic </span>Lake) to the Gulf of Suez, but was little frequented, being described by Pliny <span style="color: #0000FF;">as'asperum </span>montibus et <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mops </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aquarum'<br/>
