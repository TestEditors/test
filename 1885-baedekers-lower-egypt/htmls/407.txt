<span>of Cairo. THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">PYRAMIDS </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>GIZEH. <span style="color: #ff0000;">4</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Route. 357<br/>
<br/>
the ceiling, and kept in its place by iron cramps, here arrests the<br/>
farther progress of the explorer. The hardness of the material of<br/>
which this barrier consists compelled the Arabian treasure-hunters<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>352) to avoid it, and to force a new passage <span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">d</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>through<br/>
the softer limestone. This is the roughest and most awkward spot<br/>
on the whole route. Beyond the rugged blocks at this point we<br/>
enter a passage <span style="color: #0000FF;">CIN</span>. eel, ascending at about the same angle, and<br/>
41 yds. in length, beyond which lies the <span style="color: #0000FF;">GreatHall </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It</span>). Before<br/>
entering the latter, we diverge at the point e, by the horizontal<br/>
passage ef<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>to the so-called Chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Queens <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>P1<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">y</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. This<br/>
passage is at first 3 ft. 9 in. only in height, but at a distance of<br/>
61/2 yds. from the chamber the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flooring </span>sinks a little, so that the<br/>
height increases to <span style="color: #ff0000;">5ft</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Sinches. The N. and S. sides of the chamber<br/>
are each 17 ft. in length, and the E. and W. sides 18 ft. 10 inches.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">height </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>ft. <span style="color: #0000FF;">iin.</span>, including the pointed roof, which consists<br/>
of enormous blocks of rock placed obliquely and leaning against<br/>
each other, and projecting beyond the sides of the walls to a<br/>
distance of <span style="color: #ff0000;">51/2 </span>ft. into the surrounding masonry. We now<br/>
return to <span style="color: #ff0000;">c </span>and enter the Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, the handsomest of the<br/>
comparatively small chambers in the interior of this colossal mass<br/>
of masonry. The jointing and polish of the fine-grained <span style="color: #ff0000;">lilohaitam </span>limestone form an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unsurpassable </span>marvel of skilful masonry.<br/>
As the visitor can now breathe and look about him with more<br/>
freedom, he may verify the accuracy of'Abdellatif's remark, that<br/>
neither a needle nor even a hair can be inserted into the joints of<br/>
the stones. The Great Hall <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">28 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>high and <span style="color: #0000FF;">155 </span>ft. long. The<br/>
lower part is 3 ft. 4 in. in width; and the upper part, beyond the<br/>
last of the panels of stone, each of which is 1 ft. 8 in. thick and<br/>
2 ft. high, is 7 ft. in width. The seven courses of stone composing<br/>
the roof, which seem to have been arranged in imitation of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">arch-principle</span>, project slightly one above the other, serving to<br/>
strengthen and support the horizontal slabs which form the ceiling.<br/>
The parallel incisions in the pavement and on the walls were perhaps used to facilitate the introduction of the sarcophagus, and they<br/>
now serve to prevent the visitor from slipping. At the end of the<br/>
Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall </span>is a small horizontal passage, <span style="color: #0000FF;">22 </span>ft. long and 3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sin</span>.<br/>
high, expanding about the middle into an Antechamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">LPI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>),<br/>
which was once closed by four trap-doors of granite. The remains<br/>
of these slabs, in their pendent position, should be noticed. We<br/>
next enter the King's <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamber </span>(pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It</span>), the most interesting of all.<br/>
The N. and S. sides are each 17 ft. in length, the E. and <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>sides<br/>
341/2 ft., and the height is <span style="color: #ff0000;">19 </span>ft.; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor </span>of the chamber is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1391/2 </span>ft. above the plateau on which the Pyramid stands. The<br/>
chamber is entirely lined with granite, and is roofed with nine<br/>
enormous slabs of granite, each 181/2 ft. in length, the ends of<br/>
which rest on the lateral <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>now <span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span>nothing but an<br/>
empty and mutilated sarcophagus of granite, bearing no trace <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofan<br/>
