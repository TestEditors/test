<br/>
The battle of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kerhcla</span>, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hur</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n </span>fell, took place <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>10th<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Moharrem </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span>61 of the Hegira (10th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Oct. </span>680). Historians record<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Husen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">head </span>was sent to Damascus, while his body was interred in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meshhed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Husen </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">frontier </span>of Persia, to which Persian<br/>
pilgrims still resort in <span style="color: #0000FF;">great </span>numbers.<br/>
<br/>
Neither <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ijasmz </span>nor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Husz'n </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>remarkable for moral worth <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>political greatness. The veneration paid to these young'saints' seems to<br/>
have sprung solely from the persecutions to which the whole family of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mi </span>was subjected, coupled with the fact that they were the grandsons<br/>
of the prophet. Their misfortunes doubtless at first excited pity, a feeling which led to their being honoured with a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">deification</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">particularly </span>in Persia, where divine honours had at a still earlier period been<br/>
paid to the sovereigns of the country as being descended from the gods. It<br/>
is still the custom in Persia, during the month <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3Iolparrem</span>, to represent<br/>
the events which led to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Husens </span>death in nine successive theatrical<br/>
performances, somewhat resembling the Passion <span style="color: #0000FF;">plays </span>of Europe.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite the egress of the mosque is the entrance to the Khan<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalili </span>(p. 255). At the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">end </span>of the Rue Neuve is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Windmill<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hill </span>mentioned at <span style="color: #ff0000;">pp</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5282 </span>and 287, adjoining which is the road <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the Tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs </span>(pp. 282- <span style="color: #ff0000;">5287</span>)<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

Owing to the expansion of Cairo towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W.</span>, in the direction<br/>
of the Nile, <span style="color: #0000FF;">13111511</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>(or Boulaq), situated beyond the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isma'iliyeh<br/>
</span>Canal, and formerly an island, has become the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-harbour </span>of the<br/>
city of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">khalifs</span>. Its narrow streets present a very busy scene,<br/>
affording a more characteristic picture of Oriental life than the<br/>
capital, as the inhabitants of distant provinces are proportionally<br/>
more numerous here. Natives of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dir-Fur</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadai</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Donlgola</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kordofain</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khart.thn</span>, and members of the various negro tribes are<br/>
seen mingling in picturesque confusion; and popular festivals and<br/>
amusements are very frequently provided for their entertainment<br/>
in the evening. Goods are conveyed hither from Upper Egypt,<br/>
from Nubia, from the interior of Africa, and from the fertile Delta;<br/>
and the Nile barges are then laden with other cargoes for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">returnjourney</span>. The principal quay is nearly opposite the palace of Gezireh,<br/>
adjacent to a large timber-yard; and it is most frequented between<br/>
October and December, when the rapids of the river are most easily<br/>
navigated. The merchants of Cairo congregate here every morning<br/>
to make purchases, frequently as early as 7 o'clock. When there is<br/>
a scarcity of goods, they sometimes go out to the vessels in boats;<br/>
but when there is no scarcity, the goods are sold by auction in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bfilak</span>. Caravans bringing merchandise also arrive here not unfrequently, the most important being from Tunis <span style="color: #ff0000;">via </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">anra </span>and Siwa,<br/>
and from Wadai and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fur</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>one part of the route from <span style="color: #ff0000;">DirFfir</span>, itis said that the caravans obtain no fresh water for twelve days.<br/>
<br/>
dancers, men on camels thumping on huge drums, and lastly a promiscuous<br/>
crowd of holiday makers. The procession often marches about the town<br/>
for an hour or more, and thence out into the desert. Towards evening<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mahmal </span>is brought back to its usual place, and the festival then<br/>
terminates<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
