VIII. Historical Notice of Egyptian Art<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the ancient Egyptian poem which extols the achievements of<br/>
Ramses the temples in the valley ofthe Nile are called'everlasting<br/>
stones<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>; and the works of Egyptian art do indeed seem to lay claim<br/>
to perpetuity. Some of the monuments have existed for forty or<br/>
even fifty centuries, so that, compared with them, the works of all<br/>
other nations appear recent and modern; and a still greater marvel<br/>
is that the skill displayed in the execution of these monuments<br/>
must have been the growth <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>antecedent ages, all memorials<br/>
of which are now buried in the obscurity of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">remotest </span>antiquity.<br/>
<br/>
The Egyptian people belonged to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">so-callcd </span>Chamite race,<br/>
and, like the Semites and, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Indo-Germanians</span>, had their original<br/>
home in Asia (comp. pp. 37, 38). Whether they brought any<br/>
of their arts to the Valley of the Nile, or whether their taste for<br/>
art and their imagination were awakened for the first time by the<br/>
Father of Rivers, must of course remain for ever unknown. Some<br/>
of the very earliest of the products of Egyptian art are indeed<br/>
more akin to those of Asia than the later, but Egyptian art as a<br/>
whole presents so peculiar and unique <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>character that its origin was<br/>
most probably local. The question might indeed be settled if we<br/>
were in a position to compare early Egyptian art with that of the<br/>
Oriental nations of the same period; but of the latter we can now<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>no trace. The only sources from which we can form any<br/>
opinion regarding the original condition and the earliest development of Egyptian art are the technical execution of the oldest<br/>
known monuments and the forms and style of decoration employed<br/>
in them. Thus the ceiling-painting in the pyramidal tombs reveals<br/>
its indebtedness to the textile handicraft; for it is in the art of<br/>
weaving alone that the margins and seams there represented have<br/>
any use or significance. Again, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>most ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">tombchambers </span>contain horizontal and vertical bands and <span style="color: #0000FF;">convex </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mouldings</span>, the design of which has obviously been borrowed from a system<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ofbuilding </span>in wood. The sloping ridges ofthe pyramids point to an<br/>
original style of building with crude brick, as walls of that material<br/>
required to be tapering in form to ensure their durability. We<br/>
thus gather that the Egyptians of a very remote period were weavers<br/>
and potters, familiar with the arts of building in wood and in brick.<br/>
If we go a little farther, and venture to draw inferences from the<br/>
subjects and forms of their earliest works of art, we find that the<br/>
Egyptians of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">remotest </span>traceable period <span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been a cheerful<br/>
and contented people, free from that taste for the mystic and the<br/>
symbolical which afterwards characterised all their exertions in<br/>
the sphere of art, and endowed with a love of life and nature<br/>
which they zealously manifested in the earliest products of their<br/>
imagination.<br/>
