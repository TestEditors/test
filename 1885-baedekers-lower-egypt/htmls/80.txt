<br/>
</span>having begun to subside, it generally rises again for a short time,<br/>
sometimes regaining and even passing its <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>culminating point.<br/>
At length it begins to subside steadily, and after a time the decrease becomes more and more rapid. In January, February, and<br/>
March the fields from which the water has receded gradually dry<br/>
up, and in April, May, and the first few days of June the river is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>its lowest. The height of the inundation most favourable for<br/>
agriculture at the present day has been ascertained by long observation to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">23 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cnbits </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2 </span>inches (<span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span>. about <span style="color: #0000FF;">41ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Elm</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cubit<br/>
</span>being <span style="color: #ff0000;">21.356iuchesl</span>, while in the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">lterodotus </span>16 <span style="color: #0000FF;">cubits </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficed</span>, and the god of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile </span>in the Vatican is therefore represented as surrounded by sixteen children. A single <span style="color: #0000FF;">cubit </span>more is<br/>
apt to cause terrible devastation in the Delta<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and elsewhere to cover<br/>
many fields destined for the autumn crop <span style="color: #ff0000;">fnuldri</span>, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">74 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, while a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">deficiency </span>of two <span style="color: #ff0000;">cubits </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">canses </span>drought and famine in Upper Egypt.<br/>
As health depends to a great extent on the regularity of the<br/>
pulsations of the heart, so the welfare of the whole of this singular<br/>
country is <span style="color: #0000FF;">jeopardised </span>by a too powerful or a too scanty flow of the<br/>
great artery on which its very existence depends. An excessive<br/>
overflow, especially if it does not give notice <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>approach in<br/>
due time, is far more disastrous now than formerly, as the extensive<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton-fields </span>in the Delta will not bear flooding, and have to be<br/>
protected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankments</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Egypt is now no longer a vast lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the inundation as<br/>
it formerly was, nor does the overflow of the fields take place in a<br/>
direct manner as is commonly supposed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>water is conducted<br/>
into a vast network of reservoirs and canals, and distributed as required (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">7|</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, and special engineers are appointed for their<br/>
supervision. The whole of the cultivable land is divided into huge<br/>
basins, in which the water introduced by the canals is maintained<br/>
at a certain height until it has sufficiently saturated the soil and<br/>
deposited the requisite quantity of mud. After the water in the<br/>
river has <span style="color: #ff0000;">subsided</span>, that in the basins may either be discharged into<br/>
the river or into the canals, or it <span style="color: #ff0000;">maybe </span>used for <span style="color: #0000FF;">filling </span>other <span style="color: #0000FF;">basins </span>lying at a lower level. During these operations many of the<br/>
villages are connected by means <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">embaulunents </span>only, while others<br/>
can only he reached by boat, and the whole country presents a<br/>
very peculiar and <span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesque </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance<br/>
<br/>
</span>if the river and the system of canals <span style="color: #0000FF;">connected </span>with it are in<br/>
any way neglected, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">consequences </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>very disastrous, as was<br/>
notably the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>during the latter part of the Byzantine supremacy<br/>
and under the disgraceful sway of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maxuelukes</span>, when the fertile<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">soil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rlgypt </span>yielded less than one-half of its average produce. The<br/>
mean difference between the highest and the lowest state <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
river is <span style="color: #0000FF;">about'YI </span>ft. at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuzln</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">liven </span>in March and April the traveller will have an <span style="color: #0000FF;">opportunity </span>of<br/>
observing how powerful and rapid the flow of the river still is<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
