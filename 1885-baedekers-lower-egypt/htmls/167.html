</span>natural origin. The name <span style="color: #0000FF;">signifies'rehearsal</span>', or'reading', and<br/>
the book is divided into parts <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rchs</span>. The first revelation<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">vouchsafed </span>to the Prophet took place in the'blessed night' in the<br/>
year 609. <span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>many interruptions, the'sending down' of the<br/>
Koran extended over twenty-three years, until the whole book,<br/>
which had already existed on'well-preserved tables' in heaven,<br/>
was in the prophet's possession. During the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Abbaside<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">khalifs </span>it was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">matter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">keenest </span>controversy whether the Koran<br/>
was created or uncreated. (The Oriental Christians have likewise<br/>
always manifested a great taste for subtle dogmatic questions, such<br/>
as the Procession of the Holy Ghost) The earlier, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">ill </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eccan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sfirehs</span>,<br/>
which on account of their brevity are placed at the end <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>book,<br/>
are <span style="color: #ff0000;">characterisedby </span>great freshness and vigour of style. They are in<br/>
rhyme, but only partially <span style="color: #0000FF;">poetic </span>in form. In the longer <span style="color: #0000FF;">an-ehs </span>ofa<br/>
later period the style is more studied and the narrative often<br/>
tedious. The Koran is nevertheless regarded as the greatest masterpiece <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabic </span>literature. The prayers ofthe Muslims consist almost<br/>
exclusively of passages from this work, although they are entirely<br/>
ignorant of its real meaning<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Even by the early commentators<br/>
much of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Igor-an </span>was imperfectly understood, for Mohammed,<br/>
although extremely proud of his'Arabic Book', was very partial<br/>
to the use of all kinds of foreign words. The translation of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lgoranheingprohibited</span>, Persian, Turkish, and Indian children learn<br/>
it entirely by rote.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>has been translated into English, French, German, Italian,<br/>
and Latin. The best English translations are those of Sale (1734; with<br/>
a'preliminary discourse<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>and copious notes; published in a cheap form<br/>
by Messrs <span style="color: #0000FF;">Warns </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span>00., London) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rodwell </span>(London, 1861).<br/>

(3). FUTURE STATE AND <span style="color: #0000FF;">PREDESTINATION</span>. The doctrine of the<br/>
resurrection has been grossly corrupted by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koren </span>and by subsequent tradition; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>its main features have doubtless been borrowed from the Christians, as has also the appearance of Antichrist,<br/>
and the part to be played by Christ at the Last Day. On that day<br/>
Christ will establish <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam </span>as the religion of the world. With<br/>
him will re-appear <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Mahdi</span>, the twelfth Imam <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>153), and the<br/>
beast of the earth <span style="color: #0000FF;">o. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rig</span>), while the peoples of Gog and Magog<br/>
will burst the barrier beyond which they were banished by Alexander<br/>
the Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">144 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The end of all things will be ushered in by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">trumpet-blasts </span>of the angel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asrafil</span>; the first of these blasts will kill<br/>
every living being; a second will awaken the dead. Then follows<br/>
the Judgment; the righteous cross to Paradise by a bridge of a<br/>
hair's breadth, while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wicked </span>fall from the bridge into the abyss<br/>
of hell. Some Muslims believe in a kind of limbo, like that of the<br/>
Hebrews and Greeks, while others maintain that the souls of the<br/>
dead proceed directly to the gates of Paradise. At the Judgment<br/>
every man is judged according to the books of the recording angels<br/>
(p. 142). The good have the book placed in their right hands,<br/>
but it is placed in the left hands of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wicked</span>, bound behind<br/>
