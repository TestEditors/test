of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton-cleaning </span>mills afford an indication of the wealth of the<br/>
country. A little farther on, near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Benin</span>, on the Damietta arm of<br/>
the Nile, is a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroyal </span>palace, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where'Abbis </span>Pasha (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">107 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sail </span>Pasha's predecessor, was murdered in <span style="color: #ff0000;">18:34</span>. The train crosses the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damietta </span>branch of the Nile by an iron bridge, and, immediately beyond it, reaches<br/>

p. 407), or Benha l-'Asal, i.e.'Benha of the honey<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, so called from<br/>
a jar of honey which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Makaukas</span>, the Copt (p. 374), is said to have<br/>
sent from this place to the Prophet. The red oranges and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Ydsuf </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Efendi</span>' mandarins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Benha </span>are much esteemed at Cairo,<br/>
and excellent grapes are also produced here.<br/>
<br/>
To the N.E. of Benha, not far from the town, and intersected by the<br/>
railway, are the ruins of the ancient Athribis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'heart- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ty</span>' of antiquity, situated in the 10th Nomos of Lower Egypt, and named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Km </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">etAh-ib </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hy </span>the natives of the village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Atr'ib </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E21 </span>The site of the ancient town is still traceable, but the remains hardly repay a visit, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">no<br/>
</span>inscriptions are now left<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>The heaps of rubbish begin near the Rosetta<br/>
branch of the river and end by a small canal. A lion bearing the name<br/>
of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.</span>, found here and carried to Europe, and the fact that the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">town </span>and the deities belonging to it are mentioned in a few hieroglyphic<br/>
inscriptions, indicate that it was founded in the time of the Pharaohs.<br/>
A Roman-Egyptian necropolis was at a later period founded at the end<br/>
of the long street on the remains of ancient buildings. Brugsch, who visited the place in 1851, describes it <span style="color: #0000FF;">thus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'The </span>dead lay in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">chains<br/>
</span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chambers </span>which were situated immediately below the surface<br/>
of the mound of rubbish and were constructed of black Nile-bricks dried<br/>
in the sun. The chambers were vaulted and lay adjacent to each other.<br/>
I sought in vain for inscriptions and paintings, but one of the chambers<br/>
was coloured red. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>consist of square boxes ot'cedar-wood,<br/>
the sides being about an inch in thickness. The mummies were admirably<br/>
preserved and elaborately encased in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">cerements</span>. Neither they nor<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>bore any trace of hieroglyphics, but on the lid of one of the<br/>
latter I found the word <span style="color: #ff0000;">HATPAE </span>and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">date </span>Many statues and busts of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greece-Roman </span>period have also been found here, which indicate that<br/>
the town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Athribis </span>was a place of <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerable </span>importance at this late<br/>
epoch of Egyptian history<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
