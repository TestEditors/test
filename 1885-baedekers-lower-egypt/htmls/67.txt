the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pope</span>) for circulation in Egypt. Notwithstanding the serious<br/>
defects to which we have alluded, the Coptic community boasts of<br/>
a number of highly respectable members, and in spite <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>frequent<br/>
heavy contributions levied from the sect by previous governments,<br/>
it contains several wealthy landowners and merchants, some of<br/>
whom we shall hereafter have occasion to name.<br/>
<br/>
3. <span style="color: #ff0000;">BBDUIxs</span>. Bedu (sing. bedawi) is the name applied to the<br/>
nomadic Arabs, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Arab </span>to those who immigrated at a later period and settled in the valley of the Nile. They both differ materially from the dwellers in towns and from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>, who<br/>
usually call themselves'Sons of the Arabs' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'Arab</span>). The<br/>
subdivisions of the Beduin tribes are called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kabi'leh </span>(whence<br/>
the name Kabyles, applied to some of the Algerian <span style="color: #ff0000;">lledru'nsL<br/>
</span>Though differing greatly in origin and language, the wandering<br/>
tribes of Egypt all profess Mohammedanism. Again, while some<br/>
of them have immigrated from Arabia or Syria, partly in very<br/>
ancient, and partly in modern times, and while others are supposed to be the aboriginal inhabitants of the territories claimed<br/>
by them (as the Berbers of N. Africa and the Ethiopians or Blemmyes of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nubia </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, or former dwellers on the Nile expelled from their<br/>
homes by foreign invaders, they all <span style="color: #0000FF;">differ </span>greatly from the stationary<br/>
Egyptian population; and this contrast is accounted for by the<br/>
radical difference between the influences of the desert and those of<br/>
the Nile valley. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>may be divided into two leading<br/>
groups: <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>in the narrower sense, <span style="color: #ff0000;">i</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">6</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">speaking<br/>
</span>tribes, most of whom have probably immigrated from Arabia or Syria, and who occupy the deserts adjoining Central and Northern<br/>
Egypt, or who are to be found in different regions of Southern Nubia<br/>
as a pastoral people; <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>)'Bega', who range over the regions of Upper<br/>
Egypt and Nubia situated between the Nile and the Red Sea<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and<br/>
extending to the frontiers of the Abyssinian mountains <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>their territory being known <span style="color: #ff0000;">as'Edbai</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>To these last the name of Ethiopians may as accurately be applied as that of Arabs to the first<br/>
group; and they are believed by Dr. Lepsius to be the descendants<br/>
of the Blemmyes, who occupied the Nubian part of the valley of the<br/>
Nile down to the 4th cent. after Christ, when they were expelled<br/>
by'Nubian' invaders from the south. The second group consists of<br/>
three <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>races, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hadendoa</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bisharin</span>, and the Ababdeh.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">last-named</span>, who are widely scattered in the valleys of the<br/>
desert between the tropics and the latitude of Keneh and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Igos√©r</span>,<br/>
and who lead a <span style="color: #0000FF;">poverty-stricken </span>life with their very scanty stock of<br/>
camels and goats, are those with whom alone we have to deal as<br/>
inhabitants of Egypt. Though closely resembling the other Boga<br/>
tribes in appearance, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ababdeh </span>(sing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abidi</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gebadei </span>of<br/>
Pliny) possess an original language of their own <span style="color: #ff0000;">C'to-bedyawiyeh0</span>,<br/>
which, however, they have long since exchanged for <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>Arabic.<br/>
Besides the girdle round their loins they wear a kind of long <span style="color: #0000FF;">white<br/>
