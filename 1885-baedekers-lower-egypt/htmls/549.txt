destroying angel is well known. The historical foundation of the embellished narrative is corroborated by Egyptian and Greek records, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>state that Merenptah was compelled by various disastrous occurrences to<br/>

but it is difficult to follow the route taken by the emigrants during the first<br/>
few days.

there seems little doubt that it was the Red Sea which the Israelites crossed,<br/>
when we consider that their route to the E. was obstructed by a line of<br/>
fortifications. Believing this, we at once succeed in identifying the stations<br/>
at which they halted, and in accounting for the apparently eccentric route<br/>
chosen by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moses</span>. The following passage occurs in Numbers xxxiii. 5, <span style="color: #0000FF;">el<br/>
</span>seq<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'And </span>the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tunis </span>and the N. pastoral districts. The various detachments were here<br/>
united; their hearts were filled <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>joyous hopes of reaching the happy,<br/>
promised land, and, with their swords ready to resist opposition, if necessary, the Israelites thus departed from Egypt'armed', and with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>

while under the yoke of their oppressors had little opportunity of learning to use their swords, lost courage and desired to return. Moses knew<br/>
the character of the multitude under his care, and was aware that they<br/>

</span>Museum is preserved <span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span>papyrus letter upwards of 3000 years old, in which<br/>
an Egyptian writer describes his departure from the royal palace at<br/>
Ramses, observing that his object was to follow two fugitive servants.<br/>
The writer mentions that he started from Ramses on the 9th day of the<br/>
third summer month<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>that he arrived on the 10th at Segol in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Succoth</span>,<br/>
and on the 12th at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khetam</span>, and that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">there </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">learned</span>, that the fugitives<br/>
had taken the route in the direction of the wall (<span style="color: #0000FF;">tug</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aubu-Gerrha-Shdr</span>,<br/>
see p. 426), to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>of Migdol. If <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meets </span>and the Israelites are <span style="color: #0000FF;">substituted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the two fugitive servants, and the pursuing Pharaoh for the<br/>
writer, the route is precisely the same as that followed by the Hebrews<br/>
on their Exodus. As the writer arrived on the first day at Segol, and on<br/>
the third arrived at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, and as the fugitives took the route thence<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Migdol </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Anbu-Gerrha-Sh11r</span>, so also did the Israelites. On their<br/>
arrival there the Israelites were then on the bank of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sil'bvm'c<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">smith </span>This lake was well known to the ancients, but has long since<br/>
been filled with sand, and has therefore fallen into oblivion. According<br/>
to ancient accounts the lake was in the form of a long strip, separated<br/>
from the Mediterranean by a narrow barrier only, and extending along<br/>
the coast. Diodorus informs us that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lake </span>was entirely overgrown<br/>
with reeds and papyrus plants, and that it was very dangerous to travellers, particularly when a violent S. wind drove the sand of the desert<br/>
over its surface so as entirely to conceal the water, as the surface might<br/>
then easily be taken for land, and thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">hire </span>the ignorant to their de<br/>
