at their repasts according to the schools to which they belonged (Aristotelians, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Platonists</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Stoics</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Each department elected a president, and the body<br/>
of presidents formed a council, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span>deliberations were presided over <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>

embellished buildings ofthe Museum various <span style="color: #ff0000;">othcrimportantestablishments<br/>
</span>were connected, chief among which was doubtless the library, with copying<br/>
and binding rooms, where the manuscripts were reproduced, adapted for<br/>
use, and fitted with rollers and cases. Besides the revenues enjoyed by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Museum </span>in its corporate capacity, a yearly salary was paid to each member<br/>
from the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philadelphus </span>downwards. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Parthey </span>estimates the members<br/>
in the time of the first Ptolemies at one hundred at least, but it was<br/>
probably much smaller at a later period. The Alexandrian School was<br/>
chiefly celebrated for its distinguished professors of the exact sciences,<br/>
including geography, astronomy<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>mathematics, mechanics, natural history,<br/>
medicine, and anatomy. Among its most celebrated scholars were Eratosthenes and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Straho</span>, the geographers; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hipparchus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaeus</span>, the<br/>
astronomers; Archimedes, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mechanician</span>; Euclid, the founder of geometry; and Herophilus and Erasistratus, the anatomists. The branch of<br/>
learning most successfully cultivated by the members of the Museum,<br/>
however, was grammar, or philology, as it would now be called.'The<br/>
task of transmitting to posterity in a pure form the whole of the knowledge<br/>
and intellectual creations of an earlier period may perhaps be regarded<br/>
as the noblest aim of philology, and this task was most ably performed<br/>
by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">philologists </span>of Alexandria. It is to their critical labours that we<br/>
owe the preservation of the Greek literature, which has exercised so<br/>
great an influence on the culture <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">West </span>and on modern history generally<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. In these words <span style="color: #0000FF;">l'arthey </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sums </span>up the result of the labours of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandrite </span>scholars, whose individual merits we cannot here discuss.<br/>
The chief Library at Alexandria, the nucleus of which consisted of<br/>
the library left by Aristotle, belonged to the Museum, having been founded<br/>
by Ptolemy Lagi with the assistance of Demetrius <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phalercus</span>. It was<br/>
arranged in the reign of Philadelphus, and rendered accessible by being<br/>
placed in the Museum. Zenodotus, Callimachus, and Eratosthenes were<br/>
the first librarians. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Callimachus </span>provided the scrolls with titles. As to<br/>
the number of volumes in the library our chief source of information is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>scholium <span style="color: #0000FF;">0n </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Plautus</span>, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ritschl</span>'s commentary. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the time of Ptolemy<br/>
Philadelphus the number was about 400,000, which, by deducting duplicates,<br/>
was reduced to <span style="color: #ff0000;">90,000. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ln </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Caesar</span>'s time, when the library was burned,<br/>
the number had probably risen to about <span style="color: #ff0000;">000,000</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pergameuiau<br/>
</span>collection of books, which Antony presented to Cleopatra, contained 200,000<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">serous</span>. These treasures, collected in one place and easily accessible,<br/>
enabled the members of the Museum to pursue the studies most congenial<br/>
to them. A second library was placed in the apartments of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serapenm</span>.<br/>
The site of the Serapeum, or great temple of Serapis, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo<br/>
</span>mentions very briefly, may be approximately determined by the fact that<br/>
it must have stood near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pompey</span>'s Pillar. The god to whom it was<br/>
dedicated was introduced by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>, in order that both Greeks<br/>
and Egyptians might have a deity recognised by both, who might be<br/>
worshipped in common. Ptolemy Soter is said to have caused the image<br/>
of the god to be sent from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sinope </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pontus</span>, the inhabitants of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>were most unwilling to part with it. At length, after three years, the<br/>
colossus is said himself to have entered the vessel and by a miracle to<br/>
have arrived at Alexandria in three days. To the Greeks he was introduced<br/>
as Pluto, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the Egyptian priests called him <span style="color: #0000FF;">osir </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-Api </span>They both<br/>
regarded him as the god of the infernal regions, and as the Greeks<br/>
associated him with Pluto, the Egyptians connected him with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptab</span>. The<br/>
introduction of the new god was the more easily accomplished as it was<br/>
favoured by the priesthood of both nations, their <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-intentioned </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">object<br/>
</span>being to attract worshippers of different races to the same shrine, and,<br/>
at one spot at least, to blend the religious sentiments of the Greeks and<br/>
Africans. After his arrival in Egypt Serapis was of course transformed<br/>
into an entirely new divinity, and his rites were remodelled so as to suit<br/>
