<br/>
prising Greek sailors set forth to solve the great geographical problem<br/>
of the ancient Hellenic world regarding the true character and situation<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>The Red Sea was also navigated by the merchantmen of<br/>
the Ptolemies and the Romans, who by this route imported precious<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stuffs </span>from India and spices from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabia </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>the robes and pearls which<br/>
decked Cleopatra, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">frankincense </span>which perfumed the halls of<br/>
the Palatine. The waves of this sea, moreover, wash the shores of<br/>
places deemed sacred by two different religions, viz. Mt. Sinai, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tie</span>, the seaport of Mecca'. (Stephan)<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the Exodus of the Israelites and their passage<br/>
of the Red Sea, see p. 481. If the Red Sea is really meant, and<br/>
not the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbonic </span>Lake, as supposed by Brugsch, the scene of the<br/>
passage was most probably near the modern Suez.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Am </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mfisa </span>is an oasis, the property of <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Costa <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>415),<br/>
about five furlongs in circumference, and watered by several springs.<br/>
The traveller will easily find a pleasant <span style="color: #0000FF;">resting-place </span>for luncheon.<br/>
The vegetation here is very luxuriant. Lofty <span style="color: #0000FF;">date-palms </span>and wild<br/>
palm saplings, tamarisks, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">teams </span>thrive in abundance; and<br/>
vegetables are successfully cultivated by the Arabs who live in the<br/>
mud hovels near the springs, and who expect a <span style="color: #ff0000;">balsshish </span>from<br/>
visitors. Their gardens are enclosed by opuntia hedges <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">palings</span>,<br/>
at the entrances to which the traveller is beset by barking <span style="color: #0000FF;">dogs</span>.<br/>
The springs, situated in the midst of these gardens, consist of<br/>
several turbid pools of brackish water. The largest of them,<br/>
enclosed by an old wall, is said to have been the spring called<br/>
forth from the rock by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">red </span>of Moses, or the bitter waters which<br/>
the prophet sweetened by casting a certain tree into them. The<br/>
scene of these miracles, however, must have been a considerable<br/>
distance to the S. of this point; but this oasis may have been the<br/>
spot where Moses and the Israelites sang their beautiful song of<br/>
praise, recorded in Exodus, xv.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">q </span>will sing unto the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously: the<br/>
horse and his rider hath he thrown into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">seat </span>The Lord is my<br/>
strength and song, and he is become my salvation: he is my God, and<br/>
I will prepare him an habitation; my father's God, and I will <span style="color: #0000FF;">exalt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span>.<br/>
The Lord is a man of war: the Lord is his name. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharaoh</span>'s chariots<br/>
and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">best </span>hath he cast into the sea: his chosen captains also are<br/>
drowned in the Red sea. The depths have covered them: they sank into<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>bottom as a stone. Thy right hand, 0 Lord, is become glorious in<br/>
power: thy right hand, 0 Lord, hath dashed in pieces the enemy. And<br/>
in the greatness of thine <span style="color: #ff0000;">cxecllency </span>thou hast overthrown them that rose<br/>
up against thee: thou sentest forth thy wrath, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">consumer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>them as<br/>
stubble. And with the blast <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thy </span>nostrils the waters were gathered together, the floods stood <span style="color: #0000FF;">upright </span>as an heap, and the depths were <span style="color: #ff0000;">congcaled </span>in the heart of the sea. The enemy said, I will pursue, I will<br/>
overtake, I will divide the spoil; my lust shall be <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfied </span>upon them<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>I will draw my sword, my hand shall destroy them. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Then </span>didst blow<br/>
with thy wind, the sea covered them: they sank as lead in the mighty<br/>
waters<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The oasis is also interesting in a geological point of view, particularly on account of the formation of a number of springs, which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">funnel</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shaped </span>cavities at the top of isolated mounds, <span style="color: #ff0000;">4</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">6 </span>ft.<br/>
in height. These springs have been described by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Frees</span>, the geologist, whose account will be best appreciated by the traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">if<br/>
