<span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>. Outline of the History of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">CHRONOLOGICAL </span>TABLE.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">INTRODUCTION</span>. There is no people in the world whose history<br/>
is traceable to so remote a period as that of the Egyptians. Other<br/>
nations may possibly <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>understood the art of writing as early as<br/>
they, but no specimens <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>have been preserved; whereas the Egyptian records, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>in stone, burned in clay, or written on leather<br/>
or on scrolls <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>papyrus, have survived the ravages of thousands of<br/>
years. The preservation of these memorials, however, is mainly<br/>
due to the dryness of the air in the rainless valley of the Nile, and<br/>
to the property possessed by the hot sand of the desert of hermetically sealing everything committed to its keeping.<br/>
<br/>
The remote dates with which Egyptian chronology deals seem <span style="color: #0000FF;">mythical </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">judged </span>by the standards of Jewish and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christian </span>chronographers, and particularly when compared with the supposed date of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">creation </span>of the world; but they are derived from the lists given by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1Ianetho</span>, which have been confirmed by the monuments themselves.<br/>
<br/>
The priest <span style="color: #0000FF;">MANETHO </span>(Egypt. Mai <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>That, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'beloved </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thotb0 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mehennytum </span>(the modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">Semennfid</span>, p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">415</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, being acquainted with the Greek<br/>
language, was employed by King Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>. Philadelphus (B.C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">284-246</span>)<br/>
to translate the ancient historical works preserved in the temples. This<br/>
'Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">History</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>of Manetho enjoyed a high reputation at a later period,<br/>
but was subsequently lost, with the exception of his lists of kings and <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">date</span>, which have been transmitted to us partly by Flavius Josephus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>Jewish historian (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1st </span>cent. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D.J</span>, and partly by Christian historians.<br/>
<br/>
The monuments and inscriptions in some cases <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirm</span>, and in<br/>
others supplement, the records transcribed by Manetho for the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">our </span>information being derived from the series of kings'<br/>
names inscribed on tablets found at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydus</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkara</span>,<br/>
from papyrus scrolls, particularly one in the Museum <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Turin</span>, and<br/>
lastly from historical and genealogical notices on the walls of temples and tombs, on statues, implements, and trinkets. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">methodical </span>mode of utilising these fragmentary historical records was first<br/>
taught by the learned Prof. Lepsius (<span style="color: #0000FF;">d. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1881</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
<br/>
</span>The lists of the Pharaohs are arranged in the families <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>dynasties<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thinites</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memphites</span>, and others. If it <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>assumed that these different houses reigned in succession, and their reigns <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>simply added<br/>
together, the sum which results is very large. <span style="color: #0000FF;">But</span>, if it <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>assumed that<br/>
many of the dynasties mentioned by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manetho </span>reigned contemporaneously<br/>
in different parts of the country, the reigns of members of the leading<br/>
dynasties alone have to be added together, and a comparatively moderate<br/>
sum is the result. Adopting the former method of computation M. Mariette<br/>
has fixed the date of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manes</span>. the first King of Egypt, as <span style="color: #ff0000;">13.0</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">5002</span>, while<br/>
Sir Gardner <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wilkinson</span>, proceeding on the latter assumption, assigns the<br/>
date B.C. 2700 to the same monarch. Lepsius, on the other hand, believes<br/>
the true date to be 3.0. <span style="color: #ff0000;">3892</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Manetho </span>states that an interval of 3555<br/>
years <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>3553, taking into <span style="color: #0000FF;">account </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">differenee </span>between the Egyptian<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">and-the </span>Julian year) elapsed between the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Manes</span>, the first King <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanchus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">11</span>. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">340</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">330</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, the last of the native <span style="color: #0000FF;">sovereign</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Our </span>information becomes more definite after the beginning of the<br/>
New Empire, while from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">20th </span>Dynasty (<span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0555</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>downwards the dates of the different kings are well ascertained.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>accordance with the arrangement of the history of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egypt<br/>
