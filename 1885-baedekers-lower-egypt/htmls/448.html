<span>392 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">J. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SA </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tdhu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mustaba<br/>
<br/>
</span>group of doves, cranes, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mountain-goat</span>, two more antelopes, and<br/>
to the left, in the corner, four more mountain-goats<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Adjoining<br/>
these figures on the left is another figure of Ti (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Adjoining the right corner of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>side of this court (see<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">above</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>is a corridor, formerly closed by a door, and also divided by<br/>
another doorway in the middle. It is now entered by a wooden<br/>
door, the key of which is brought by the guide.<br/>
<br/>
On each side of this Corridor <span style="color: #0000FF;">CPI</span>. E) are several series of<br/>
bearers of offerings (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">380</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, one above the other. On the<br/>
right is a niche 91/4 ft. high and 6ft. wide, containing a'stele'<br/>
dedicated to the wife of Ti<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the left, on the inner part of the<br/>
pillar of the doorway, is Ti with his titles; then (between the first<br/>
and second doors) the transport of the statue of Ti and persons<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>incense. Hieroglyphics in different places inform us that<br/>
'this is the statue of thorn-acacia wood of the deceased Ti', and<br/>
'this is the statue of ebony, which they are drawing';'the drawing<br/>
of the statue is a good drawing<span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'The </span>servants pour out water'<br/>
is the inscription at the place where a servant is wetting the<br/>
runners of the sledge which bears the <span style="color: #0000FF;">statue</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right<br/>
(between the niche and the second door) are several more rows of<br/>
gift-bearers. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the door-posts <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">left</span>) two male figures and (right)<br/>
Ti with his titles. Over the door (N. side) musicians and dancers,<br/>
and (<span style="color: #0000FF;">B. </span>side) Ti in a boat (damaged). We then come to a door<br/>
on the right, leading into an oblong, covered, and therefore<br/>
somewhat dark chamber (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1'1</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, the scenes adorning which afford<br/>
us an insight into the domestic economy of the deceased. Among<br/>
them are represented a complete pottery and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">bake-house</span>, and<br/>
numerous vessels of various forms, destined for different uses.<br/>
On the upper part of the left door-post of this chamber a piece<br/>
of the sycamore wood to which the door was attached is still in its<br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">P </span>Above, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>each side of the door of this chamber <span style="color: #0000FF;">Con </span>the E.<br/>
side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">corridor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, are several barges, some of which are light<br/>
boats with a number of rowers with broad, shovel-shaped oars,<br/>
while others of heavier build have lateen sails and are also steered<br/>
with ears. <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the bow of the vessel stands a man with a long pole,<br/>
used for sounding, in the same way as is done at the present day.<br/>
These boats are conveying retainers of the deceased to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakkfira </span>to<br/>
pay homage to his remains; for we read beside one of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sailingboats</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'Arrival </span>from the N. country, from the villages of the<br/>
family estate, in order that they may behold the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chamberlain </span>who<br/>
is perfect in consequence of his distinction in occupying the first<br/>
place in the heart of his sovereign, and the master of the mystery<br/>
of the kingdom of the dead<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ti</span>'. The captain of the vessel, of<br/>
which we annex a woodcut, wishing to land on the W. bank, is represented as giving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">command </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-'Oireetion</span>, starboard, starboard!<span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
