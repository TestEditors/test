rebellion against Sultan Farag (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">284</span>), and who had been defeated<br/>
by the sultan and imprisoned for a time at this spot. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice<br/>

</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sultan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sll√©lt'h </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Jltzlmmrli </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Muaiyad</span>, after having defeated and executed<br/>
Sultan Farag, his predecessor, who was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">emerging</span>. the founder of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cireassian </span>Mameluke dynasty of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Burgites </span>(from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabic </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bun-g</span>, or<br/>
castle, and so called from their service in <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortresses</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, ascended the throne<br/>
in Nov. 1412. His reign was <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>occupied with victorious campaigns<br/>
against his unruly Syrian <span style="color: #0000FF;">vessels</span>, in which he was greatly aided by the<br/>
military talents of his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibrahim</span>. He was a man of weak constitution,<br/>
and the early death of Ibrahim is said to have accelerated his end;<br/>
while some authors state, on the other hand, that he <span style="color: #0000FF;">tensed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">him </span>to<br/>
be poisoned from jealousy on account of his greater <span style="color: #0000FF;">popularity </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nuniyed<br/>
</span>died on 13th Jan. 1421. Although, according to Egyptian historians, he<br/>
died very wealthy, his coffers did not contain money enough after his<br/>
death to defray the expenses of his funeral, all his property having been<br/>
carried off by his emirs, while no one cared for the dead body. Though<br/>
successful in his foreign policy, he had neglected to secure the good will<br/>
of his people. His emirs were never sure of their lives, many of them<br/>
having been imprisoned or executed on mere suspicion. <span style="color: #0000FF;">As </span>most of the<br/>
public offices <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>sold to the highest bidder, his subjects were oppressed<br/>
and maltreated by his judges and officials, who sought to indemnify<br/>
themselves by practising all kinds of extortion. Notwithstanding all<br/>
the misfortunes he brought upon Egypt by his <span style="color: #ff0000;">maladmiuistration </span>and<br/>
cupidity, <span style="color: #ff0000;">hluaiyad </span>had no lack of panegyrists, who remembered only that<br/>
he was a pious Muslim, that <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>associated much with scholars, that he<br/>
was distinguished as a theologian<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>an orator, and a poet, and that he had<br/>
founded a mosque, a hospital, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">medreseh</span>, or theological school. On<br/>
several occasions, after having perjured himself with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>to compass<br/>
the destruction of his opponents, he spent several days in a dervish <span style="color: #ff0000;">mouastery</span>, attended the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lauded </span>the monastery with presents. Like<br/>
the dervishes, he usually <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>nothing but a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Woollen </span>robe, and to prove<br/>
his humility he commanded the preachers to descend one of the steps of<br/>
their pulpits when they had occasion to mention his name. Towards<br/>
religionists of other <span style="color: #0000FF;">creeds </span>he was intolerant in the highest degree. He<br/>
exacted heavy contributions from Christians and Jews, and he re-enacted<br/>
and rigorously enforced the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sumptuary </span>laws of rOmar (A.D. <span style="color: #0000FF;">634-41</span>),<br/>
Mutawakkil (849-50), the Fatimite Khalif <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hakim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ON-ION</span>; see p. 279),<br/>
and Sultan Mohammed <span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nz'tsir </span>(1293-1341; p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">277 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. Not only were the<br/>
colours to be worn by the Christians and Jews prescribed <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>costume<br/>
of the former being dark blue, with black turbans, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>wooden cross<br/>
weighing <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ntm</span>. hung round their necks; that of the latter, yellow, with<br/>
black <span style="color: #0000FF;">turbans</span>, and a black ball hung from their <span style="color: #0000FF;">necks</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>; but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fashion<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>their dress and length of their turbans, and even the costume of their<br/>
women, were so regulated as entirely to distinguish them from the followers<br/>
of the prophet.<br/>
<br/>
The handsome bronze gate at the entrance originally belonged<br/>
<br/>
to the mosque of Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hasan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>260). The plan of the mosque<br/>
resembles that of the mosque of'Amr (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">324</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>; but this <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice </span>is<br/>
richer in its details, although without any strongly defined characteristics. Here, too, columns of many different kinds have been<br/>
employed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right, by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maksfira</span>, is the mausoleum of the<br/>
sultan, and on the left that of his family. The sanctuary is separated<br/>
by a railing from the inner court (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Salli</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cl-Chimp</span>), which is shaded<br/>
with acacias and sycamores. The ruins on the S. side are those of<br/>
a public bath which was formerly connected with the mosque, but<br/>
its plan is scarcely now traceable. The mosque has three minarets,<br/>
