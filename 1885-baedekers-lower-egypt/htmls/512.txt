</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosetta </span>Stone, now preserved in the British Museum<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">state<br/>
</span>of black basalt, the corners of which are unfortunately damaged, bearing<br/>
three different inscriptions on its face. The subject is the same in each<br/>
case, but the first is in the sacred hieroglyphic language and character<br/>
of the ancient Egyptians, the second in the demotic, or popular, language and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Writing</span>' letters, are well preserved,<br/>
but of the 14 hieroglyphic lines all on the right side and twelve on the<br/>
left are seriously damaged. The subject of the inscription is a decree of<br/>
the priests in honour of Ptolemy V. Epiphanes (B. C. <span style="color: #0000FF;">204481</span>), issued on<br/>
27th <span style="color: #0000FF;">March</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>195, when the king was still a boy of fourteen. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">highsounding </span>titles <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>king, the date, and the place (Memphis) where the<br/>
resolution was passed are first set forth in eight lines. Next follow in<br/>
twenty-eight lines the motives <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>induced the hierarchy to issue the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">decree</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>viz. the numerous benefits conferred by the king on his country,<br/>
the gifts presented by him to the clergy and the temples, the reduction<br/>
and remission of taxes, the indemnity granted to criminals, his leniency<br/>
towards the rebels who had'returned to peace<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, this vigorous resistance<br/>
to enemies approaching by land and by sea and to the town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lycopolis</span>,<br/>
his prudent conduct on the occasion of an inundation which took place<br/>
in the eighth year of his reign, and his liberal contributions towards the<br/>
support of the sacred animals and the repair and adornment of the<br/>
temples. The remainder of the inscription gives <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>resolution itself, to<br/>
the effect that a statue, a chapel of gold, and an image of the king should<br/>
be placed in every temple, decorated <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>feast-days, and revered; and<br/>
farther<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">decree</span>. inscribed on a slab of hard stone in hieroglyphic,<br/>
demotic, and Greek writing should be placed in every temple of the<br/>
first and second <span style="color: #0000FF;">rank</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The last paragraph of the Greek inscription informs us that we shall <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>the two translations<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>one in the sacred, the<br/>
other in the popular language of the Egyptians, adjacent to it. The first<br/>
step towards deciphering these last was to endeavour to discover the<br/>
alphabet of each kind of character. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic </span>part was first <span style="color: #ff0000;">scrutinised</span>,<br/>
and M. S. de <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sacy </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aekerbhrd</span>, a Swedish scholar, first succeeded<br/>
in determining the groups which contained the word Ptolemy. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the<br/>
hieroglyphic part (p. 110) some of the groups were framed, and, as had<br/>
been ascertained from the Roman obelisks and other sources before the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">finding </span>of the Rosetta Stone, it was inferred that these were <span style="color: #0000FF;">times </span>of<br/>
kings. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dr. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Th</span>. Young, an Englishman, and M. F. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Champollion</span>, the<br/>
French Egyptologist, then succeeded. independently of each other, the<br/>
former in 1819, the latter in 1822, in discovering the missing alphabet by<br/>
means of a comparison of the names of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>kings. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Champollion<br/>
</span>afterwards prosecuted his researches with such marvellous success, that<br/>
he justly merits the highest rank among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">decipherers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Taking the framed group which recurred most frequently on the Rosetta<br/>
Stone to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaios</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>as the Greek inscription indicated, he compared<br/>
it with other framed symbols on an obelisk found at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>contemporaneously with the Rosetta inscription. The symbols on the obelisk, which<br/>
occurred in connection with the name of Ptolemy, he conjectured to signify Cleopatra, as the number of letters also indicated. He then proceeded to compare the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">groups</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Q </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">q </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p </span>he took to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>Ptolemy<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>symbol in the second of these groups is a triangle, which he<br/>
supposed to represent <span style="color: #0000FF;">k</span>, and which does not occur in the first group<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>. The second symbol in the second group, a lion, he took to<br/>
be <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, and he was <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>by the fact that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>sym<br/>
