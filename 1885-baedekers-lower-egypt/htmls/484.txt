<span>426 Route 7. THE ISTHMUS OF SUEZ. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues<br/>
<br/>
</span>far as Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Timsah</span>, as fossil <span style="color: #0000FF;">conchylia</span>, particularly varieties of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Spondylus</span>, now occurring in the Red Sea, but not in the Mediterranean, have been found there. The isthmus, however, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">undoubtedly </span>of very ancient formation, having been as broad at the time<br/>
of the journey of Herodotus (B. <span style="color: #ff0000;">G. </span>454) as it is now. With regard<br/>
to the formation of the isthmus we may quote the following passage<br/>
from M. J. Schleiden<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">~<br/>
</span>'If we suppose a strait substituted for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">isthmus</span>, it is not difficult<br/>
to foresee what would happen. The waves of the Red Sea entering it at<br/>
one <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>would soon choke it with sand, while the same result would be<br/>
caused on the Mediterranean side by the prevalent N. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. winds, the<br/>
Etesian winds of antiquity. About halfway between the seas these different agents would come into collision, and throw up a bar of sand, the<br/>
situation of which would naturally be a little to the N. of the central<br/>
point, as the action of the waves on the S. side would be more regular<br/>
than that of the wind on the N., and thus be generally able to penetrate<br/>
farther. This bar would gradually <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>raised by the action of the waves,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>at an accelerating rate in proportion as its growth would<br/>
present an obstacle to the motion of the water, until its level came to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>above the level of low tide. The surface would then become dry by<br/>
exposure to the air<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and the loose sand, blown about by the winds,<br/>
would form sand-hills of the kind found on every <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-shore</span>. In this<br/>
way the connection between the seas would at length be cut <span style="color: #0000FF;">off</span>, and the<br/>
barrier of El-Gisr formed'.<br/>
<br/>
The Isthmus of Suez has, from a very early period, formed an<br/>
important highway between Asia and Africa. A considerable part<br/>
of its area was occupied with lakes and swamps, while the higher<br/>
points were fortified to prevent the passage of invaders. Near<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Key </span>of Egypt', at the E. extremity of the curve<br/>
formed by the coast of the Delta, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. of Port <span style="color: #0000FF;">said</span>,<br/>
were situated the passes by which the empire of the Pharaohs<br/>
was entered. The high road from Asia skirted the coast of the<br/>
Mediterranean, passing <span style="color: #0000FF;">Il</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">478</span>),<br/>
traversed the neck of land separating the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbouic </span>Lake from the<br/>
Mediterranean, and led <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Casinm </span>(see below, with the temple<br/>
of Jupiter Casius (the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mudem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lifts </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Kasr0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span>, and by the<br/>
town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gerrha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bf</span>, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium </span>(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">435</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, whence several roads <span style="color: #0000FF;">di<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>The agnomen of Casius is derived by Brugsch from the Semitic<br/>
Egyptian word Hazi or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilazinn</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>signifying the asylum, or land of the<br/>
asylum, a name which applies admirably to a shrine situated on the extreme E. margin of the Egyptian frontier. He also identifies the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baalzuphun </span>of the Bible, which <span style="color: #ff0000;">lay </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">beside </span>Pi-hahiroth' (Exod. xiv. 9), with<br/>
this hill and the shrine of Zeus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Casius</span>. The word <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ba'ulZephon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">occurs </span>in<br/>
a papyrus in the British Museum in the form <span style="color: #ff0000;">Battli </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zepilna</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and is the<br/>
Semitic equivalent ('lord of the north') of the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. Pihahiroth again literally means the'entrance to the reed and papyrus<br/>
swamps', by which was doubtless meant the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbnuic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Luke </span>so that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pihahiroth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">itself </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lay </span>at the W. end of the lake at the entrance<br/>
to the neck of land when approached from Egypt (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p.431</span>)<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
