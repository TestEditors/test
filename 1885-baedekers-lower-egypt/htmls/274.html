<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">244 </span>Route 3. CAIRO. Population.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">residence </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>, and of the ministers and principal authorities, and is presided over by a governor of its own. Owing<br/>
to the secluded habits of the Mohammedan families, and in<br/>
consequence of the fact that a large section of the lower classes of<br/>
the community have no fixed abode, it is a very difficult matter to<br/>
ascertain the number of the inhabitants with even approximate<br/>
precision. Judging from the average annual number of births in<br/>
Egypt and at Cairo, the population of the city may be estimated<br/>
at 400,000 souls, although at the census of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1882 </span>it was returned<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">366,108 </span>only. The number of resident Europeans is about 21,000,<br/>
including 7000 Italians, <span style="color: #ff0000;">11200 </span>Greeks, <span style="color: #ff0000;">4000 </span>French, 1600 English,<br/>
1600 Austrians, and 1200 Germans. Natives of all the principal<br/>
Oriental states are also to be found at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Giro</span>. The mass of the<br/>
population consists of Egypto-Arabian townspeople (p. 48), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fellah<br/>
</span>settlers (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">30</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts </span>(p. 42), Turks <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">52</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and Jews <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">53</span>),<br/>
the last of whom number 7000 souls. Besides the natives and the<br/>
European residents, the traveller will frequently encounter negroes<br/>
of various races, Northern Africans, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, Syrians, Persians,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Indians</span>, and other Oriental settlers.<br/>
<br/>
The Hospitals mentioned at p. 234 are fitted up in the European<br/>
style, and so likewise is the Military School (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ecoles </span>Militaires;<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rAhbisiyel0</span>, with its four departments (<span style="color: #0000FF;">staff</span>, artillery, cavalry, and infantry), connected with which there is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Veterinary<br/>
</span>School. Cairo also possesses a Girls<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>School, maintained by government (founded through the exertions of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dr. </span>Dor, a Swiss), and a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cliemieal-Pharrnaceutieal </span>Laboratory, presided over by M. Gastinel,<br/>
and possessing an excellent pharmaceutical collection. The medicines required for all the hospitals in the country are prepared at<br/>
the laboratory, and the yield of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">19 </span>saltpetre manufactories of<br/>
Egypt (about 1000 tons per annum) is tested <span style="color: #0000FF;">here</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>

who preside so <span style="color: #0000FF;">effectually </span>over the public safety that the traveller<br/>
may explore the <span style="color: #0000FF;">remotes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>and dirtiest purlieus of the city without<br/>
