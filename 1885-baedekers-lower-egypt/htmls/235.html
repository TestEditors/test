<br/>
</span>embankment now forms the site of a great part of the modern city, and<br/>
on its <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>side is situated the Custom <span style="color: #0000FF;">House</span>, where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller </span>first sets<br/>
foot on Egyptian soil.<br/>
<br/>
'To the right of the entrance to the Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harbour</span>', Strabo then goes<br/>
on to say (ib., <span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>9),'lies the island with the tower of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phacos</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the<br/>
side are the rocks and the promontory of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lochias-l</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, on which stands a<br/>
royal castle. To the left of persons entering are the inner royal buildings connected with Lochias, which comprise painted saloons and groves.<br/>
Below these lies an artificial harbour, appropriated to the kings<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and<br/>
closed, and opposite to it is the small island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Antirrhodus</span>, with a<br/>
royal castle and another small harbour. The island was so named from<br/>
being, as it were, a rival of Rhodes. Above it lies the theatre. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beyond<br/>
</span>this is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Poseidium</span>, a curved promontory which runs out from the<br/>
Emporium (or market-place), and to which Antony added an embankment<br/>
projecting still more towards the middle of the harbour. At the end of<br/>
this embankment <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>erected a royal residence which he called Timonium.<br/>
This was his last work, when after his defeat at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Actium</span>, deserted by his<br/>
friends, he crossed to Alexandria and determined for a time to lead the<br/>
life of a Timon (or Temple<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesar</span>), with the market-place and warehouses. Such are the surroundings<br/>
of the Great Harbour. <span style="color: #0000FF;">G </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">10</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>Immediately beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heptastadium </span>is<br/>
the harbour of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eunostus</span>, and above it the artificial harbour, sometimes<br/>
called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cibotus </span>(literally, the box), which also has docks. From this<br/>
harbour runs a navigable canal to Lake Mareotis'.<br/>
<br/>
Among the PRINCIPAL QUARTERS of the ancient city we may first<br/>
mention the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span>, or city of the dead, at the extreme W. end,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>there are many gardens, tombs, and establishments for embalming<br/>
bodies' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, xvii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>), and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhakotis</span>,'the quarter of Alexandria<br/>
situated above the ships' magazines' (Strabo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>. 6), the most ancient<br/>
part of the city, and chiefly inhabited by Egyptians. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bruchium<br/>
</span>quarter, which was walled in, and contained the palaces and public<br/>
buildings, lay on the mainland between Lochias and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heptastadium</span>,<br/>
while the Jews<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>quarter was situated to the E. of Lochias, between the<br/>
sea and the main street, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>of which was closed by the Canopic<br/>
gate. Outside the gate lay the hippodrome, and farther to the E. was<br/>
the suburb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nicopolis</span>, 30 stadia from Alexandria, which possessed an<br/>
amphitheatre and a race-course, and where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">quinquennial </span>games were<br/>
celebrated (Strabo, xvii. c. I<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ยง </span>10).<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the STREETS of ancient Alexandria, Strabo (ib. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
</span>has the following passage<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>The whole town, indeed, is intersected with<br/>
streets practicable <span style="color: #0000FF;">res </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wagons </span>and riders, but the two broadest of them<br/>
are more than a hundred feet in width and cross each other at a right<br/>
angle.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>This statement has been confirmed and supplemented by the<br/>
excavations of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahmud-Bey</span>, who has discovered traces of a rectangular<br/>
network of streets. seven of them running lengthwise, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">wisw</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>to<br/>
E.N.E., and twelve <span style="color: #0000FF;">breadthwise</span>, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">wa</span>. to S.S.E. He has also<br/>
identified the two main streets mentioned by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, the more important<br/>
of which probably coincided with the modern Rue de la <span style="color: #0000FF;">Forte </span>Rosette,<br/>
beginning at the Gate of Rosetta, the ancient Canopic gate, intersecting<br/>
the town, and at its W. end deviating from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">straight </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">line._ </span>This street<br/>
is still the most important in the town, and it is probably indebted for<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">its </span>long existence to the conduit constructed under it at <span style="color: #0000FF;">an.ea.rly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">period</span>,<br/>
which still supplies the cisterns with Nile water. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>the buildings <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>once flanked this street a few relics only now exist, but the excavations<br/>
have brought to light distinct traces of the old pavement, which consisted<br/>
of blocks of granite, and have established the fact that the street was<br/>
about 45 ft. in width, or double that of the other streets. On each <span style="color: #0000FF;">side<br/>
</span>of the causeway ran <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot-pavements </span>with arcades, of which, however.<br/>
the traces are but <span style="color: #0000FF;">scanty</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The important cross-street mentioned by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">smith</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>has been discovered by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahmud-Bey </span>on the E. side of the town.<br/>
<br/>
- + <span style="color: #ff0000;">New </span>much reduced in extent, owing to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dilapidation </span>of the<br/>
breakwaters and the damage done by earthquakes.<br/>
