<span style="color: #0000FF;">outed </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>. White shirts, collars, and wristbands, which require<br/>
frequent and skilful washing, should <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>as far as possible eschewed,<br/>
as good <span style="color: #ff0000;">laundresses </span>are rare and expensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>2-4 fr. per dozen articles,<br/>
irrespective of <span style="color: #0000FF;">size</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Few travellers walk in Egypt, except for very<br/>
short distances, but sportsmen should add a stout pair of waterproof<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">shooting-boots </span>to their <span style="color: #0000FF;">equipment. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>For tours on horse or camel-back two small portmanteaus are<br/>
much more suitable than a box or trunk of larger size.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lllfsCELLAXEOUS</span>. Among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">important </span>extras are a drinking<br/>
cup of leather or metal, a flask, a strong <span style="color: #0000FF;">pocket-knife</span>, note-books,<br/>
writing-materials, straps and twine, a thermometer, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pocket-compass </span>of medium size, and a supply of magnesium <span style="color: #0000FF;">wire </span>for lighting<br/>
caverns and dark chambers. To these may perhaps be added a<br/>
'remontoir', or keyless watch, as a watch-key lost during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey<br/>
</span>is not easily replaced.<br/>
<br/>
HEALTH. Fine as the climate of Egypt generally is, the chilly<br/>
mornings and evenings are often treacherous, and if cold is caught<br/>
it is apt to result in a tedious intermittent or other fever. There<br/>
are good chemists at Alexandria and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span>small <span style="color: #0000FF;">medicine-chests </span>adapted for the climate may be purchased. In serious<br/>
cases of illness a European doctor, when procurable, should always<br/>
be consulted, as the traveller's own experience acquired at home is<br/>
of little avail in the climate of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Fits of shivering are the usual prelude to an attack of fever. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Quinine </span>is the best remedy, of which 1-3 doses should be taken on the days<br/>
when the patient is free from fever. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rest </span>and copious perspiration will<br/>
also afford relief.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Diarrhea</span>, which is apt to turn to dysentery, is a very common complaint in this climate<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and is generally the result of eating unripe fruit<br/>
or of catching cold. The patient should first take a slight aperient, and<br/>
afterwards tincture of opium or concentrated tincture of <span style="color: #0000FF;">camphor</span>. A<br/>
simple farinaceous diet (such as well-boiled rice), with tea or well<br/>
matured, unfortified, and unsweetened red wine, will be beneficial, while<br/>
fruit, meat, and fatty substances should be avoided. In cases both of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">diarrhea </span>and fever all remedies are sometimes unavailing except change<br/>
of climate, especially if the patient is in a marshy or unhealthy locality.<br/>
<br/>
Sprains, which often result from exploring ruins and caverns, are<br/>
most effectually treated with cold compresses, while the injured limb<br/>
should be tightly bandaged and allowed perfect rest.<br/>
<br/>
The sting of a scorpion (seldom dangerous) or bite of a snake is<br/>
usually treated with ammonia.<br/>
<br/>
Sunstroke is very common in Egypt, even in spring when the air is<br/>
still cool. The head and neck should therefore always be carefully<br/>
shielded in one of the ways above indicated. The usual remedies are<br/>
rest and shade, cold compresses, and warm baths with <span style="color: #0000FF;">cold </span>douches<br/>
applied to the head and neck.<br/>
<br/>
Grey spectacles or veils may be used with advantage when the eyes<br/>
suffer from the glare of bright weather. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Zinc </span>eye-wash, or some other<br/>
innocuous lotion, should be used in such cases.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">sticking-plaster</span>, lint, as well as all <span style="color: #0000FF;">effervescing </span>powders, and<br/>
other medicines carried by the traveller should be carefully kept from<br/>
exposure to moisture<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
