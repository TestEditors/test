and, after him, by Ra, who appears from the inscription on the royal<br/>
tombs at Thebes to have been a purely <span style="color: #ff0000;">pantheistie </span>conception, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'frame </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>universe' and'the universe', and whose sphere <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore </span>embraced the lower aswell as the upper regions. [ See also<br/>

<br/>
The SACRED ANIMALS and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">MIXED </span>Forms, which generally<br/>
consist of human bodies with the heads of animals, frequently recur as companions of the gods, or are used as emblems of the deities<br/>
themselves. In each case those animals were selected whose<br/>
inherent dispositions and habits corresponded to the power or<br/>
phenomenon of nature personified in the god. Specimens of these<br/>
animals were kept in and near the temples, and the finest of them<br/>
were <span style="color: #0000FF;">embalmed </span>after death and revered in the form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mummies<br/>
</span>Thus, the maternal divinities were appropriately represented<br/>
by the cow, the patient mother and nurse; the goddess of love, the<br/>
bride of Ptah, was represented with the head of a fierce lion or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">eat</span>;<br/>
the crocodile was sacred to Sebek, the god who caused the waters of<br/>
the Nile to rise; and the hawk, which soars towards heaven like<br/>
the sun, was dedicated to Ra. The symbol of Ptah was the black<br/>
Apis bull, whose great power of generation seemed analogous to<br/>
the never ceasing creative energy of the black soil of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">TUE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">EGYPTIAN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Goes</span>. The chief of the gods, as we have<br/>
already mentioned, was Ptah, the Greek Hephaestus. He was the<br/>
ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">god </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofMemphis</span>, who delivered to Ra the germs of creation,<br/>
and was assisted in his labours bythe seven <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnumu </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">architects<br/>
</span>As from him were supposed to emanate the laws and conditions<br/>
of existence, he is also styled'lord of truth'. He is represented in<br/>
the form of a mummy, but with his hands protruding from the<br/>

and <span style="color: #ff0000;">grasping </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>neck-ornament called'menat' is generally<br/>
<br/>
attached to his back, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>head he usually wears a smith's cap.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>sometimes occurs with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">scarabaeus </span>instead of a head. In view<br/>
of his connection with the doctrine of immortality and with the<br/>
infernal regions, he sometimes appears in the inscriptions as <span style="color: #ff0000;">PtahSelmr- </span>Osiris, who prescribes to the sun that has set, as well as to<br/>
the mummies of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dead</span>, the conditions under which they may<br/>
rise again and enter on a new life. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The'primzeval </span>Ptah' is also<br/>
spoken of as the head of the solar gods, and also occasionally as the<br/>
creator <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>egg, from which, according to an older myth, the<br/>
sun and the moon came forth. Thence, too, is derived his name,<br/>
which signifies'the opener'. By his side are often placed the<br/>
goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Salt-hat </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pasht</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, and his son <span style="color: #ff0000;">Imliotep </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">zlisculapius </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>sacred animal was the Apia bull, which was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">offspring<br/>
