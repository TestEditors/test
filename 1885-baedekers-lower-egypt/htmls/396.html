<br/>
one could decipher in his time, says <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'they </span>are so numerous,<br/>
that, if one attempted to copy on paper those only which appear on<br/>
the surface of these two Pyramids (those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheops </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chephren </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]<br/>
</span>they would fill more than 10,000 pages'. A similar account is given<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5rasidi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Makrizi</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lbn </span>Haukal, Edrisi, and other Arabs; and<br/>
yet on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">iucrustation </span>of Chefren's Pyramid which is preserved at<br/>
the top there is now no trace of a single letter. We must therefore<br/>
conclude that the slabs which have been removed once bore inscriptions, which were perhaps purposely destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
Construction of the Pyramids<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>In consequence of the investigations of Lepsius and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Erbkam</span>, the mode in which the Pyramids were<br/>
erected and the meaning of the account given by Herodotus are now<br/>
well ascertained. The following questions have been asked by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>1) How does it happen that the Pyramids are of such<br/>
different sizes? <span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>After Cheops and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chephren </span>had erected their<br/>
gigantic mausolea, how could their successors be satisfied with<br/>
monuments so much smaller. and of so different proportions?<br/>
(3) How is the fact to be accounted for, that an unfinished pyramid<br/>
is never met with? <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>) How could <span style="color: #ff0000;">Oheops</span>, when he ascended the<br/>
throne and chose an area of 82,000 sq. yards for his monument,<br/>
know that his reign would be so unusually long as to enable him to<br/>
complete it? (5) If one of the builders of the great pyramids had<br/>
died in the second or third year of his reign, how could their sons<br/>
or successors, however willing to carry out the plan, have succeeded<br/>
in completing so gigantic a task, and in erecting monuments for themselves at the same time? And how comes it that many other kings did<br/>
not, like Cheops, boldly anticipate a reign of thirty years and begin<br/>
a work of the same kind, the design for which might so easily have<br/>
been drawn, and might so readily have been carried out by <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">subjects </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">To </span>all these questions the researches <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Erbkam<br/>
</span>afford but one entirely satisfactory <span style="color: #0000FF;">answer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Each </span>king', says <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius<br/>
</span>in his letters from Egypt,'began to build his pyramid when he ascended the throne. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>began it on a small scale, in order that, <span style="color: #ff0000;">if </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>short<br/>
reign should be in store for him, his tomb might be a complete one.<br/>
As years rolled on, however, he continued enlarging it by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">addition </span>of outer coatings of stone, until he felt that his career was<br/>
drawing to a close. If he died before the work was completed, the<br/>
last coating was then finished, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">size </span>of the monument was<br/>
accordingly proportioned to the length of the builder's reign; so<br/>
that, had the progress of these structures always been uniform, it<br/>
would have almost been possible to ascertain the length of each<br/>
king's reign from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustations </span>of his pyramid, in the same way<br/>
as the age of a tree is determined by the number of the concentric<br/>
rings in its trunk<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>The first step taken by the king's architect<br/>
was doubtless to level the surface of the rock on which the pyramid<br/>
was to be erected, leaving, however, any elevation in the centre of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">area </span>untouched, to form a nucleus for the structure, and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">save<br/>
<br/>
