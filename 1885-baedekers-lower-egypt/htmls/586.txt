<span>51 6 Route 10. <span style="color: #0000FF;">TUR</span>. From Suez<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">mirably </span>protected by coral reefs, which, however, are dangerous to<br/>
those <span style="color: #0000FF;">unacquainted </span>with their situation<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ttor </span>affords the only good<br/>
anchorage in the Gulf of Suez, beside Suez itself, and has lately<br/>
been made the chief quarantine station of the Mecca pilgrims. As<br/>
the desert air here comes into contact with the fresh <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-breezes<br/>
</span>and as there is abundance of drinking-water, the choice of the<br/>
government seems a very judicious one. On the return of the pilgrims, the desert to the S. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tur </span>presents a scene of great animation. Long rows of tents, arranged in six groups, afford ample <span style="color: #0000FF;">accommodation </span>for the largest concourse of pilgrims, while the throng<br/>
is swelled by traders from Suez and Cairo, who sell their inferior<br/>
wares at the most exorbitant prices. On the side next <span style="color: #0000FF;">rm </span>is the<br/>
camp of the soldiers who maintain the quarantine. To the N. of<br/>
the town the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IJamrruim </span>Sidna <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mfisa </span>('Mountain of the baths<br/>
of our Lord Moses'; <span style="color: #0000FF;">370 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>), a spur of the low range of <span style="color: #ff0000;">coasthills</span>, projects into the sea. At the foot of this hill lie <span style="color: #ff0000;">sulphursprings </span>of the temperature of <span style="color: #0000FF;">92-940</span>, roofed over <span style="color: #0000FF;">by'Abbas </span>Pasha,<br/>
which irrigate plantations of palms, and are used by the natives<br/>
chiefly as a cure for rheumatism. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kal'at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e.t- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ttr</span>, a castle<br/>
erected by Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Murad</span>, is in a dilapidated condition. Most of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-plantations </span>belong to the monks of Mt. Sinai, and are<br/>
managed by their servants. Both the church and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">secular </span>building of the Greek convent at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tfir</span>, which is said to have once been<br/>
occupied by a bishop and 1000 monks, are modern and uninteresting. As an inscription on the exterior of the wall of the church<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">records</span>, they were built at the expense of the treasurer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gregorius</span>.<br/>
A few monks are always stationed here, <span style="color: #0000FF;">officiating </span>partly as chaplains to a few Christian residents, and partly as caterers for the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sinaitic </span>monastery, which is supplied with provisions and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish<br/>
</span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ttor</span>. The caravans between the sea and the monastery are<br/>
conducted by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>of the convent. Excellent fish, <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous<br/>
<br/>
</span>shells, and interesting marine animals abound here.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">EXCURSIONS</span>. The palm-garden of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-midi</span>, about a mile to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>.<br/>
of the town, is noted for its <span style="color: #0000FF;">salubrity</span>. In the limestone slopes of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">latex </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">yamrruim </span>Mam are numerous dilapidated <span style="color: #0000FF;">hermitages </span>with Christian<br/>
crosses, and several Greek and Armenian inscriptions, dating from <span style="color: #0000FF;">AD</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>633.<br/>
To the N. rises the Jebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">JIokatteb</span>, which boasts of several Sinaitic inscriptions. None of these places present much attraction.<br/>
<br/>
The Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">117111125</span>, or'Bell Mountain, is <span style="color: #ff0000;">b1/alursrlistrust </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">it<br/>

the scene <span style="color: #0000FF;">off'a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>phenomenon which was first <span style="color: #0000FF;">observed </span>by Seetzen. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>ascending the sand which covers its slope we hear a peculiar sound,<br/>
resembling that <span style="color: #ff0000;">otdistant </span>bells, which gradually increases until it terminates<br/>
in a strange kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'The </span>noise at first resembled the faint tones of an <span style="color: #0000FF;">A4o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">olian </span>harp when<br/>
first struck by the wind, and when the motion of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand </span>became more<br/>
rapid and <span style="color: #0000FF;">violent</span>, it rather assumed the sound produced by rubbing the<br/>
moistened finger on glass; but when the sand approached the foot of the<br/>
mountain, the reverberation was as loud as thunder, causing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock<br/>
</span>on which we <span style="color: #0000FF;">set </span>to tremble. () ur camels were so alarmed at the sound,<br/>
that the attendants could scarcely hold them in.'<br/>
<br/>
The phenomenon is easily explained<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in ascending over the sand<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
