from the terraces of the gates. The casemates and towers still <span style="color: #ff0000;">hear<br/>
</span>French names <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>in the bastion walls. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>payment of a small<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish</span>, the visitor may ascend the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bib </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nasir </span>and the citywall, and walk along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">top </span>of the latter to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bib </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Flotilla</span>.<br/>
These gates, the most important of the sixty which once existed<br/>
in the walls of Cairo, were erected by the vizier <span style="color: #0000FF;">Herd </span>Gamali in<br/>
the 11th century. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bib </span>en-Nasr in particular is built <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofwellhewu </span>stone, and has vaulted winding staircases in the interior,<br/>
groined vaulting in the gateway, girders with a kind of hatched<br/>
moulding, and cornices with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">corbeled </span>frieze. Over the entrance<br/>
are a slab with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cutie </span>inscription, and decorative shields. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span>principal entrance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-1i'uttO </span>is flanked with <span style="color: #0000FF;">semicircular </span>towers, and that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bib </span>en-Nasr with square towers. The<br/>
spaces between the inner and outer gates are vaulted.<br/>
<br/>
We leave the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bhb </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Naer </span>and turn to the right, crossing a<br/>

eminence not far from the road, is interred J. L. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Burclchardt<br/>

still of high authority.<br/>
<br/>
Before leaving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">city-wall </span>to the right, we observe on the<br/>
left two towers with iron basins, being the reservoirs of the Waterworks supplying the palace of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Khedive in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rAbbasiyeh </span>and<br/>
the Citadel. In front of these, but less visible, are the five <span style="color: #0000FF;">large<br/>
</span>filters for purifying the town supply.<br/>
<br/>
The water is pumped into these filters by engines of <span style="color: #0000FF;">150-horse </span>power,<br/>
situated in the Isma'iliya quarter, on the canal of that name. A smaller<br/>
pump adjoining the filters is used for <span style="color: #0000FF;">providing </span>the Citadel with water. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>temporary pumping machinery, erected in <span style="color: #0000FF;">186566</span>, at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr </span>el-'Ain,<br/>
was employed in filling the basins in the desert, and also in supplying a<br/>
small part of the city. The distribution of water is now effected by a.<br/>
double system of pipes, through one set of which the filtered water is<br/>
forced to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>height of about <span style="color: #0000FF;">80 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft.</span>, while the other brings unfiltered <span style="color: #0000FF;">water<br/>
</span>from the neighbourhood <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bdlfillr </span>for the purpose of watering the streets<br/>
and the gardens, conducting it to a height of about <span style="color: #0000FF;">30 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>only. The<br/>
engines in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'iliya </span>quarter are capable of supplying the town<br/>
with 30,000 cubic metres, or about 111,000 cubic feet, of water per day.<br/>
The government pays 40 <span style="color: #0000FF;">centimes </span>for each cubic metre of filtered <span style="color: #0000FF;">water<br/>
