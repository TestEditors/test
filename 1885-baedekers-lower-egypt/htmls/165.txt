The earliest men were all believers, but they afterwards fell away<br/>
from the true faith. A revelation therefore became necessary, and<br/>
it is attained partly by meditation, and partly by direct communication. The prophets are very numerous, amounting in all, it is<br/>
said, to 124,000; but their ranks are very various. Some of them<br/>
have been sent to found new forms of religion, others to maintain<br/>
those already existing. The prophets are free from all gross sins;<br/>
and they are endowed by God with power to work miracles, which<br/>
power forms their credentials; nevertheless they are generally<br/>
derided and disbelieved. The greater prophets are Adam, Noah,<br/>
Abraham, Jesus, and Mohammed.<br/>
<br/>
Adam is regarded as a pattern of human perfection, and is<br/>
therefore called the'representative of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gory</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- Noah's history is<br/>
told more than once in the Koran, where it is embellished with<br/>
various additions, such as that he had a fourth, but disobedient<br/>
son. The preaching of Noah and the occurrence of the Deluge are<br/>
circumstantially recorded. The ark is said to have rested on Mt.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Joi</span>, near Mossul. The giant'Uj, son of'Enak, survived the flood.<br/>
He was of fabulous size, and traditions regarding him are still<br/>
popularly <span style="color: #0000FF;">current<br/>
<br/>
</span>Abraham (Ibrahim) is spoken of by Mohammed as a personage<br/>
of the utmost importance, and in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran</span>, as well as in the Bible<br/>
he is styled the'friend of God' (comp. James ii. 23). Mohammed<br/>
professed to teach the'religion of Abraham', and he attached special<br/>
importance to that patriarch as having been the progenitor of the<br/>
Arabs through Ishmael. Abraham was therefore represented as<br/>
having built the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ka</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'ba</span>, where his footprints are still shown. One of<br/>
the most striking passages in the Koran is in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sfireh </span>vi. <span style="color: #ff0000;">76</span>, where<br/>
Abraham is represented as first acquiring a knowledge of the one<br/>
true God. His father was a heathen, and Nimrod at the time of<br/>
Abraham's birth had ordered all new-born children to be slain (a<br/>
legend obviously borrowed from the Slaughter of the Innocents at<br/>
Bethlehem); Abraham was therefore brought up in a cavern, which<br/>
he quitted for the first time in his fifteenth year.'And when night<br/>
overshadowed him he beheld a star, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>This is my Lord;<br/>
but when it set, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>I love not those who disappear. And<br/>
when he saw the moon rise, he said <span style="color: #0000FF;">again </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>This is my Lord<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but<br/>
when he saw it set, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">exclaimed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Surely my Lord has not<br/>
guided me hitherto that I might go astray with <span style="color: #0000FF;">eating </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">man </span>Now<br/>
when he saw the sun rise, he spake <span style="color: #0000FF;">again </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>That is my Lord; he<br/>
is greater. But when it likewise set, he <span style="color: #0000FF;">exclaimed </span>- 0 people,<br/>
I will have nothing to do with what ye idolatrously worship; for<br/>
I <span style="color: #0000FF;">turn </span>my face steadfastly towards Him who created heaven and<br/>
earth out of nothing; and I belong not to those who assign Him<br/>
partners <span style="color: #ff0000;">1'<br/>
