Place <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezbekiyeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1'1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">:3</span>), or simply the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezbckfyeh</span>, which<br/>
is named after the heroic Emir <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezbek</span>, the general of Sultan<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Knit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bey </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">968 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, who brought the general and son-in-law of <span style="color: #ff0000;">llajesidl</span>. asa captive to Cairo. A mosque was erected here in honour<br/>
of his victory; and, though the building no longer exists, its name<br/>
still attaches to the site. This was once the focus of the Oriental<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>of Cairo, but the native industries have gradually to a great<br/>
extent been absorbed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">EurOpeans</span>. The principal hotels, several<br/>
of the consulates, numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">cafes</span>, palatial dwelling-houses, handsome shops, and the theatres are situated in this <span style="color: #ff0000;">magnificentpluce</span>,<br/>
in the centre <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>which are Pleasure Grounds, with the luxuriant<br/>
vegetation peculiar to the marvellous climate of Egypt. The gardens afford a delightful promenade, especially in the afternoon,<br/>
and also present a very attractive appearance by gaslight. They<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>laid out in 1870 <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>Barillet (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">76</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>70), formerly chief<br/>
gardener to the city of Paris. They are octagonal in shape, and<br/>
cover an area of <span style="color: #0000FF;">201/2 </span>acres; the walks are altogether 11/2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span>in<br/>
length. The gardens contain a variety of rare and beautiful trees<br/>
and shrubs, and the open spaces are planted with the Lippia <span style="color: #ff0000;">nadiflom</span>, to supply the place of grass, which does not thrive in this<br/>
dry climate. The grounds are open to the public in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">forenoon</span>,<br/>
but in the afternoon a charge of 10 paras silver (no change given)<br/>
is made for admission. An Egyptian band, which generally performs European music, plays here daily from 5 to about 8 <span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m</span>.<br/>
Among the other attractions of the place are several cafes, a theatre, where Italian comedies are performed in summer (p. 233 ], a<br/>
French restaurant, where a good supper is <span style="color: #ff0000;">proeurable</span>, and a photographer's studio. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>hill with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">belvedere </span>commands<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>view, and below it is a pretty grotto. The garden was at first<br/>
visited almost exclusively by Europeans, but it is gradually becoming the fashion for Arabs to send their veiled wives and their<br/>
children to promenade here, while the Europeans of the better<br/>
classes now treat it with unreasonable neglect. The trees, shrubs,<br/>
and flowers thrive admirably, the greatest show <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">blossom </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">being<br/>
