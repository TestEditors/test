<span>44 THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>disappointment<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">national </span>pride to utter humiliation. Their<br/>
conquerors succeeded in maintaining their position, and though<br/>
apparently at first inclined to moderation, were at length driven by<br/>
the conduct and the previous example of the Copts themselves to<br/>
persecute and oppress them to the uttermost.<br/>
<br/>
In spite, however, of all <span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>disasters, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>numerous community<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copes </span>has always existed in Egypt, a fact which is mainly to be<br/>
accounted for by the remarkable tenacity and constancy of the<br/>
Egyptian character. Owing, however, to the continual oppression and contempt to which they have been subjected, the grave<br/>
disposition of the subjects of the Pharaohs has degenerated into<br/>
sullen gloom, and their industry into cupidity. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">raneonr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>they have so long cherished has embittered their <span style="color: #0000FF;">character</span>, while<br/>
the persecutions they have suffered have taught them to be at one<br/>
time <span style="color: #0000FF;">cringing</span>, and at another arrogant and overbearing. They are<br/>
in very few respects superior to their Mohammedan <span style="color: #0000FF;">countrymen<br/>
</span>They generally possess an hereditary aptitude for mathematical<br/>
science, and are therefore in great request as book-keepers and<br/>
accountants, but on the other hand they are entirely destitute of the<br/>
generous and dignified disposition of the Arabs. They obey their<br/>
law which forbids polygamy, but constantly abuse that which permits them to indulge in spirituous liquors, drunkards being frequently met with, even among their priests. Their divine worship<br/>
will strike the traveller as strange, and anything but <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifying </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">elevating<br/>
<br/>
</span>The traveller may distinguish the Copts from the Arabs by their<br/>
dark <span style="color: #0000FF;">turbans</span>, which are generally blue or black<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and their <span style="color: #ff0000;">darkeoloured </span>clothes<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">This </span>costume was originally prescribed by their<br/>
Oppressors, and they still take a pride in it as a mark of their origin,<br/>
though now permitted to dress as they please. A practised eye will<br/>
also frequently detect among them the ancient Egyptian cast of<br/>
features<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Towards </span>strangers the Copt is externally obliging, and<br/>
when anxious to secure their favour he not <span style="color: #ff0000;">nnfrcquently </span>appeals to<br/>
his Christian creed as a bond of union. Many Copts have recently<br/>
been converted to Protestantism by American missionaries, particularly in Upper Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>through the foundation of good<br/>
schools and the distribution of cheap Arabic Bibles. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Even </span>the<br/>
orthodox Copts have a great reverence for the sacred volume, and it<br/>
is not uncommon to meet with members of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">sect </span>who know the<br/>
whole of the gospels by heart. The Roman propaganda, which was<br/>
begun by Franciscans at the end of the 17th and beginning <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">15th </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cent.</span>, has been less successful among the Copts, and there<br/>
now exist a few small <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span>Catholic communities in Upper Egypt<br/>
only (<span style="color: #ff0000;">atCrirgeir</span>, Akhmim, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Negadal</span>. To the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llomauists</span>, however,<br/>
is partly due the preservation <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">language</span>, into which<br/>
they caused the gospels to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>translated by the most learned scholars<br/>
of the day [ <span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanied </span>by a preface <span style="color: #0000FF;">asserting </span>the supremacy <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
