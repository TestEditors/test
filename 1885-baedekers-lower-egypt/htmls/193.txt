<span>HISTORY <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>ART. 171<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">af</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>alabaster near the great Sphinx appears to have been a temple of<br/>
this kind in connection with the pyramid of Chefren. Under the<br/>
new empire also the kings constructed their actual burial-places at<br/>
a distance from the monuments dedicated to their memory. The<br/>
deep rock vaults in the ravines of the royal tombs were the <span style="color: #ff0000;">restingplaces </span>of their remains, while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">great'Memnonia</span>' (which are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">plated </span>exclusively on the W. bank of the Nile at Thebes) were the<br/>
temples where rites were <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebrated </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>their memory<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mostinteresting </span>feature of the mortuary temples is their pictorial decoration.<br/>
The subjects of those in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">memnouia </span>are of course the power and<br/>
prosperity, the victories and achievements, of the monarchs, while<br/>
the private chapels contained scenes from the domestic life of the<br/>
deceased. The memnonia sometimes covered a very extensive area,<br/>
like that of Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll.</span>, which contained a library and a school.<br/>
Most of them have pylons and large <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>halls, but it cannot<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>ascertained whether they were uniform in their arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
By far the greater number of Egyptian sculptures are in immediate connection with architectural works. Colossal statues<br/>
mount guard <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>pylons and pillars, and every available surface<br/>
is adorned with reliefs. If these plastic works are to be fairly<br/>
judged, they must be regarded as component parts of the building<br/>
they adorned. Speaking of the colossal statues, Dr. Lepsius justly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">remarks</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'The </span>features of these statues, which even received<br/>
divine honours, and were enthroned in, or in front of, temples in<br/>
a commanding position, either as structural supports, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>detached<br/>
from the pillars behind them, wear the same character of monumental repose as the statues of the gods themselves, and yet<br/>
without the possibility of their human individuality being<br/>
confounded with the universally typical features of the divine<br/>
images<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-- </span>This is <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>sitting<br/>
statues, whose position (with their legs bent at a right angle,<br/>
their arms firmly pressed against their sides, and their heads<br/>
looking in a perfectly straight direction) may well be called stiff,<br/>
but not properly conventional. Many peculiarities of Egyptian<br/>
art, especially during the earlier period, are apt to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>attributed to<br/>
the imperative requirements of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacerdotal </span>authority, but they<br/>
are perhaps rather to be accounted for by the imperfection of<br/>
artistic development. The sculptors exhibit great skill in detail,<br/>
but they seem incapable of making their skill <span style="color: #0000FF;">subserve </span>the general<br/>
effect of their works. They have obviously striven to represent each<br/>
member of the body with the utmost fidelity, but they were incapable of combining them harmoniously. Thus, we generally<br/>
see reliefs with the faces in profile, the chest nearly facing us,<br/>
and the legs again in profile, a peculiarity which <span style="color: #0000FF;">recurs </span>in the<br/>
works of other Oriental nations, and even in <span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cheeks </span>of<br/>
the early period. This defect was at length overcome by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gree<br/>
</span>but of the Egyptian artists it continued permanently characteristic<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
