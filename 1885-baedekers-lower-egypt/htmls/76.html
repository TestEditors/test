Orientals is nowhere so strikingly manifested as in Egypt, where it<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>modern <span style="color: #ff0000;">rellex </span>of their ancient, world-renowned supremacy.<br/>
Most of them are immigrants from the various Greek islands, and<br/>
the purity of their type is <span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span>noteworthy.<br/>
<br/>
The Italian residents, <span style="color: #ff0000;">16,000111 </span>number, consist <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>of traders of a humble class, advocates, and musicians, from the operatic<br/>
singer down to the Calabrian itinerant. Of French nationality<br/>
(15,000) are all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">artizans </span>of the higher class, who are generally<br/>
noted for their skill, trustworthiness, and sobriety, and indeed<br/>
form the most respectable stratum of the European community.<br/>
Most of the better shops are kept by Frenchmen, and the chief<br/>
European officials of the government, including several architects<br/>
and engineers, are French. The English settlers number about 5000,<br/>
exclusive of the troops, of which there were about 7000 at the<br/>
beginning of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1865</span>. Until recently <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">specialities </span>were the manufacture of machinery and the construction of railways and harbours;<br/>
but of late they have also almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">monopolised </span>the chief posts in<br/>
those branches of the administration <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>post and telegraph <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofOe</span>,<br/>
railways, <span style="color: #0000FF;">custom-house</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>that have been remodelled after the European pattern. A large majority of the residents who enjoy the protection of the British consulate are Maltese, and to them apply even<br/>
more forcibly most of the remarks already made regarding <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Greeks</span>. It has been ascertained that the Maltese settlers in foreign<br/>
countries are more numerous than those resident in their two<br/>
small native islands, and of these a considerable proportion <span style="color: #0000FF;">belongs </span>to Egypt. At home, under the discipline of <span style="color: #0000FF;">British </span>institutions, they form a pattern little nation of their own, but in Egypt,<br/>
where they are freed from the restraint <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">these </span>influences, they<br/>
are very apt to degenerate and to swell unduly the ranks of the<br/>
criminal class. Many of the Maltese, however, are enterprising<br/>
tradesmen and industrious artizans<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">shoemakers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">joiners</span>.<br/>
To the Austrian (<span style="color: #ff0000;">30007 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>and German <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>1000) community belong a<br/>
number of merchants of the best class, all the directors of the principal hanks, many physicians and teachers, innkeepers, musicians,<br/>
and lastly <span style="color: #ff0000;">handicraftsmen </span>of humble pretensions.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to the capability of <span style="color: #ff0000;">EurOpeaus </span>of becoming <span style="color: #ff0000;">aevlimatised </span>in Egypt, there are a <span style="color: #ff0000;">numberofwideiy </span>divergent opinions.<br/>
Much, of course, must depend on the nature of the climate of their<br/>
own <span style="color: #0000FF;">respective </span>countries. it has been asserted that European<br/>
families settled in Egypt die out in the second or third generation,<br/>
but of this there is no sufficient proof, as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eurolman </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rennnunity<br/>
</span>is of very recent origin, and many examples to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">contrary </span>might<br/>
be cited. The climate of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>is less <span style="color: #0000FF;">enervating </span>than that of most<br/>
other hot countries, an advantage attributed to the dryness of the<br/>
air and the saline <span style="color: #0000FF;">particles </span>contained in it; <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the range <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftemperature </span>between the different seasons is greater than in Ireland or<br/>
Portugal<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
