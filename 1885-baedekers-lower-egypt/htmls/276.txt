<span>2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mum</span>. Street <span style="color: #ff0000;">scenes</span>.<br/>
<br/>
who has succeeded in discovering an <span style="color: #0000FF;">effectual </span>formula of <span style="color: #0000FF;">conjuration</span>.<br/>
After this display of my abilities, I vaulted into the saddle with as much<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ease </span>and assurance as if Cairo had been my home. The donkey-boy <span style="color: #0000FF;">next<br/>
</span>probably asked me <span style="color: #0000FF;">-'where </span>to<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>? <span style="color: #0000FF;">Whereupon</span>, feeling that my stock of<br/>
Arabic phrases and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cabalistic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">formula </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>was nearly exhausted, I replied<br/>
in a very abbreviated <span style="color: #0000FF;">style </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>kullo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">mm</span>, that is,'everything' (meaning<br/>
that I wanted to see everything). The donkey-boy then nodded his <span style="color: #ff0000;">yam/ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">{ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">b<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mm </span>m-ef ('all right, I <span style="color: #ff0000;">undorsMnd0</span>, and I now felt perfect <span style="color: #0000FF;">confidence </span>in<br/>
my powers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Speech</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">... </span>My donkey now set <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>at a gallop and plunged<br/>
into the midst ofa labyrinth <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lanes </span>full of riders and walkers, but<br/>
where <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>was going to, or how far<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>or why, I was unable to tell. That,<br/>
however, was precisely the joke of the thing'. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">60112</span>.)<br/>
<br/>
Lovers of the picturesque will find such rides very enjoyable.<br/>
When they have sufficiently explored the narrower streets, they<br/>
may direct their attendant to return to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muski </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C'lil </span>Muski, ya<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hammar</span>'), whence the hotels are easily reached.<br/>
<br/>
It is not, however, until the traveller has learned to distinguish<br/>
the various individuals who throng the streets, and knows their<br/>
different pursuits, that he can thoroughly appreciate his walks or<br/>
rides. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>may therefore give a brief description of some of the<br/>
leading characteristics of the different members of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">community<br/>
</span>The traveller will probably first be struck with the differences of<br/>
colour in the Turbans. From a very early period it has been customary for the Arabs to distinguish their different sects, families,<br/>
and dynasties by the colour of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">turbans</span>. Green <span style="color: #0000FF;">turbans </span>form<br/>
the badge of the'Sherifs', or descendants of the prophet, and they<br/>
are also frequently worn by the Mecca pilgrims, green being also<br/>
the colour of the banner of the prophet. The'Ulama, or clergy<br/>
and scholars, usually wear a very wide and broad, evenly folded<br/>
turban of light <span style="color: #0000FF;">colours </span>The orthodox length of a believer's turban<br/>
is seven times that of his head, being equivalent to the whole<br/>
length of his body, in order that the turban may afterwards <span style="color: #ff0000;">he<br/>
</span>used as the wearer's winding sheet, and that this <span style="color: #0000FF;">circumstance<br/>
</span>may <span style="color: #ff0000;">familiarise </span>him with the thought of death. The dress and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tnrbans </span>of the Copts, Jews, and other non-Muslim citizens, are<br/>
generally of a dark colour, those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Copts </span>being blue, and<br/>
those of the Jews yellow, in accordance with a decree issued in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>century (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">2712</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Blue </span>is also the colour indicative of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mourning</span>. The Women <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the poorer and rustic classes wear <span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>a blue gown and a veil. Their ornaments consist of silver<br/>
or copper bracelets, earrings, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ankle-rings</span>, while their chins,<br/>
arms, and chests are often tatooed with blue marks. In Upper<br/>
Egypt <span style="color: #0000FF;">nose-rings </span>are also frequently seen. The women of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">upper </span>classes <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>never so handsomely dressed in the streets as<br/>
at home. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Their </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lignres</span>, in early life, are generally upright and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kram-ful</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">They </span>colour their eyelashes and eyelids dark, and their<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">linger </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">too</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nails </span>with henna, which gives them a brownish<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">yellow </span>tint. When equipped for riding or walking, most ladies<br/>
wear a <span style="color: #0000FF;">light</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured </span>silk cloak, with very wide sleeves (<span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>), over their home attire. They also <span style="color: #ff0000;">don </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">buried</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>veil<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
