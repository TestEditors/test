<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cleorthose </span>who held this doctrine there could be no original act of<br/>
ation, and no plurality of gods; but a metaphysical conception<br/>
difficult of apprehension could not be <span style="color: #0000FF;">propounded </span>to the great<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span>of the people. For the use of such persons it was, therefore<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Emplifled</span>, and clothed with allegorical forms, through the medium<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>which they might behold it as through a veil, somewhat obscured,<br/>
at at the same time embellished and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sham </span>of its terrors. This<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">onstituted </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">EXOTERIC </span>DOCTRINE, with which was connected<br/>
the theogony, or theory of the origin and descent of the divinities<br/>
who represented the various forces and phenomena of nature. These<br/>
gods, however, though not existent from all eternity, were neither<br/>
created nor begotten, but were regarded as having been self-created<br/>
in the wombs of their own mothers, and are therefore spoken of as<br/>
'their own fathers<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>,'their own sons', and the'husbands of their<br/>
mothers'. The deities accordingly are seldom spoken of as single<br/>
individuals, butin triads, as father, mother, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">son </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comp</span>. p. 130)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The primary source from which all life proceeds, the first cause<br/>
of all things, was clothed with a personal form, called Nun. The<br/>
principle <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflight</span>, and the creative power of nature, which implants<br/>
in matter the germs of existence and light, was Khepera, or the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabzeus </span>with the sun's disk, whose emblem was the beetle (<span style="color: #ff0000;">soarubaeus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">racer</span>). As that insect rolls up into a ball the eggs which<br/>
produce its offspring, and was supposed to have no female, so this<br/>
deity was believed to have concealed within the globe <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>world<br/>
the germs of organic life. Ptah is the greatest of the gods, and is<br/>
the embodiment ofthe organising and motive power developed from<br/>
moisture (Nun). It is he who imparts form to the germs sown by<br/>
Khepera, <span style="color: #ff0000;">andunder </span>the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofSekhem </span>Nefer breaks the ball rolled<br/>
along by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabaaus</span>, or in other words the egg of the universe,<br/>
from which emerge his children, the elements and the forms of<br/>
heaven and earth. Ra, a deity who <span style="color: #0000FF;">beam </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">seventy-live </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">different<br/>
</span>forms, at first appears in the Nun under the name of Tum, or the<br/>
evening sun; during his passage through the lower hemisphere,<br/>
that of night, he is known as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Klmum</span>, and is born anew on the<br/>
next morning of the creation, bursting forth in the form of a child<br/>
(Harmachis) from a lotus-flower floating on the Nun. Evening and<br/>
night precede the morning and day; and Amenthes, or the infernal<br/>
regions, were believed to have existed before the upper regions<br/>
which formed the scene of human life<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>After the breaking of the egg of the world, the universe is resolved into three <span style="color: #0000FF;">empires</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>) The heavenly Nut, represented<br/>
as a woman, bending over the earth, on whose back <span style="color: #0000FF;">float<br/>
</span>the vessel of the sun, the planets, and the constellations. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">A</span>) Seb,<br/>
or the earth, which possesses the power of eternal rejuvenescence,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>regarded by the Egyptians <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the symbol of eternity, a<br/>
deity somewhat resembling the Greek Chronos. (3) The Infernal<br/>
Regions, which are presided over by Ptah, the power productive <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
