father. Some of their dreams and visions, in which battles with demons<br/>
play an important part, have been recorded. Buried alive in these dismal recesses, they hoped to purify themselves by the prolonged service<br/>
of Serapis. We also learn from the papyri that similar monastic institutions were connected with other temples of Serapis and with those<br/>
of Isis, which were often associated with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">511111111 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">temples.There </span>is<br/>

<br/>
In the subterranean part of the Egyptian Serapeum, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>in<br/>
the rock, where the Apis bulls were interred, there were found no<br/>
fewer than 3000 monuments, and it was ascertained that the bulls<br/>
were interred in different ways at different periods of Egyptian history. No Apis sarcophagus dating from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">primeval </span>monarchy<br/>
was discovered, and it would seem that the first placed here dates<br/>
from the reign of Amenophis III. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>18th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dynasty</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. On the surface<br/>
above, a chapel was erected in honour of each <span style="color: #0000FF;">bull</span>, while his<br/>
remains were deposited in one of the square chambers hewn in the<br/>
rock, to which a sloping passage descended from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chapeL </span>No<br/>
trace of these chapels now remains. Every Apis was interred in<br/>
this way down to the thirtieth year of the reign <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span>. (19th<br/>
Dynasty<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>after which the vaults began to take a <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>form. A<br/>
subterranean gallery, about <span style="color: #ff0000;">110 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">yds</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>in length, was now hewn in<br/>
the rock, and flanked with rudely excavated <span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers </span>forty in<br/>
number, which were walled up after having received the remains<br/>
of the sacred bull. This was done down to the twentieth year of<br/>
the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psammetikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, the first king of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">26th </span>Dynasty, when<br/>
four of the Apis vaults fell in, and another site was chosen for a<br/>
new series of tombs. In the thirty-third year of that king's reign<br/>
a new gallery, flanked as before with vaults, was accordingly<br/>
excavated for the purpose. These vaults, which are much more<br/>
carefully constructed than the two series of earlier date, are still<br/>
accessible, while the others have long since been filled up.<br/>
