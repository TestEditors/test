</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">c </span>apels for themselves (Mastaba) in the form of blunted pyramids,<br/>
in order, as it <span style="color: #0000FF;">were</span>, to pay homage to the memory of their illustrious<br/>
masters. The pictorial decorations of these temples, as well as the<br/>
plastic works of the same period, serve most impressively to complete the artistic effect of the pyramids. While their marvellously<br/>
perfect execution alone indicates <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">high </span>state <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">artistic </span>development,<br/>
our admiration is specially aroused by the striking fidelity to nature<br/>
and expressiveness of the sculptures. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>criticisms<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sculpture </span>formerly current may indeed now be regarded<br/>
as entirely refuted. Even in European museums an opportunity is<br/>
afforded to the traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">becoming </span>acquainted with the noble style<br/>
by which the early Egyptian art alone is characterised. What visitor<br/>
to the Louvre, for example, can fail to remember the striking<br/>
impression produced by the statue of the'Writer?' The expressive<br/>
eyes are formed of dark quartz containing a transparent pupil of<br/>
rock crystal fixed with a small knob of metal, while the attitude is remarkable <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>lifelike fidelity and strong individuality. This statue<br/>
dates from the fifth or sixth dynasty, and the museum at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dana </span>contains other plastic works of the same period in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>an almost overdrawn realism is still more apparent. The limestone statue of RaNefer, a priest of Ptah-Sokar at Memphis, and the wooden figure of<br/>
the'village <span style="color: #0000FF;">shr'yrch</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">305 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, which the Paris Exhibition of 1867 has<br/>
brought into so favourable notice, are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">best-known </span>specimens of<br/>
a style of art of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>the very existence was unsuspected a few decades ago, and the discovery of which has tended greatly to modify<br/>
the old supposition that the Egyptian sculptors executed their works<br/>
in mere mechanical accordance with a prescribed canon. The chief<br/>
merit of the earliest Egyptian sculpture is the faithfulness of the<br/>
portraiture, which is such that the identity of the person represented<br/>
by two different statues may often be determined by the similarity<br/>
of the features, even when executed at different periods of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">person</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>life. In this way have been identified eight statues of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khat'ra</span>,<br/>
the third king of the fourth dynasty, although all differing in measurement, material, and the age represented (comp. pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">305</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">3071</span>.<br/>
Observation of nature in the case of these earliest works has evidently been carried into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">minutest </span>details. The race of men represented is <span style="color: #0000FF;">uniformly </span>of the same character, somewhat resembling<br/>
that of the modern fellahin; the figures are of a powerful. <span style="color: #0000FF;">thickset<br/>
</span>type, and their muscles are faithfully represented, <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span>to<br/>
exaggeration. These early sculptors, however, were incapable of<br/>
producing works of a more complex character, where excellence<br/>
of general effect required to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">superadded </span>to accuracy <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">detail</span>, and<br/>
in this respect they were far surpassed by their successors. Even<br/>
the reliefs in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers </span>of Memphis are executed in a<br/>
singularly fresh and unsophisticated <span style="color: #0000FF;">style</span>, and the spectator will<br/>
hardly regret the absence <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mystic </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">symbolism </span>ofthe later period<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>After the sixth dynasty there occurs asudden falling away from<br/>
