women that the Muslims generally dislike to see them praying or<br/>
occupying themselves with religion. The practice of wearing veils<br/>
is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">confined </span>to the Muslim women, but is universal in the East.<br/>
An Oriental lady would, <span style="color: #0000FF;">indeed </span>regard it as an affront to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">permitted </span>to mingle in society with the same freedom as European<br/>
ladies. Even in the Christian churches, the place for women is<br/>
often separated from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">men</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>seats by a railing. The peasant and<br/>
Beduin women, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the other hand, are often seen unveiled. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ease </span>with which <span style="color: #ff0000;">lil-lsl√©m </span>permits divorce is due to Mohammed's personal proclivities. A single word from the husband suffices to banish<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wife </span>from his house, but she retains the marriage-portion<br/>
which she has received from her husband. The children are brought<br/>
up in great subjection to their parents, often showing more fear than<br/>
love for them.<br/>
<br/>
The repetition of PRAYERS five times daily forms one of the<br/>
chief occupations of faithful Muslims. The hours of prayer (<span style="color: #0000FF;">adlin</span>)<br/>
are proclaimed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mueddins </span>(or muezzins) from the minarets of<br/>
the mosques: (l) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maghrib</span>, a little after sunset; <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi</span>)<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Ashu</span>, nightfall, about 11/2 hour after sunset; <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3</span>) Subh, daybreak; <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>4) Duhr,<br/>
midday; (<span style="color: #0000FF;">5</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Aar</span>, afternoon, about <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>hour before sunset. These<br/>
periods <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>prayer also serve to mark the divisions of the day. The<br/>
day is also divided into two periods of <span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>hours each, beginning<br/>
from sunset, so that where clocks and watches are used they require<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>set daily. Most people however content themselves with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sonorous </span>call of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mueddin</span>: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alldhu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">akbar </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">three </span>times); <span style="color: #ff0000;">ashhadu<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">Alldhu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">akbur </span>(twice), <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ildlla </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">itt'ullth</span>; i. <span style="color: #ff0000;">e.'Allah </span>is great; I<br/>

there is <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>God but <span style="color: #ff0000;">Allah</span>'. This call to prayer sometimes also<br/>
reverberates thrillingly through the stillness of night, to incite<br/>
to devotion the faithful who are still <span style="color: #0000FF;">awake</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The duty of<br/>
washing before prayer is a sanitary institution, and tanks are provided for the purpose in the court of every mosque. In the desert,<br/>
where water is scarce and precious, the faithful are permitted to<br/>
use sand for this religious ablution.<br/>
<br/>
The person <span style="color: #0000FF;">praying </span>must remove his shoes or sandals and turn<br/>
his face towards <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecca </span>as the Jews and some of the Christian sects<br/>
turn towards Jerusalem <span style="color: #ff0000;">ortowards </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">East </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11173 </span>worshipper begins<br/>
by putting his hands to the lobes of his ears, and then holds them<br/>
a little below his girdle; and he intersperses his recitations from<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fiorin </span>with certain prostrations performed in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">given </span>order. On<br/>
Fridays the midday recital of prayer takes place three quarters of an<br/>
hour earlier than usual<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and is followed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>sermon, preached from<br/>
