</span>Course. THE NILE<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Nile (comp. Map, p. 30). The Nile ranks with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amazon </span>and the Congo as one of the three longest rivers in the world<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>about 4000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">U</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, since its headstream is probably to be found in<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shimiju</span>, which rises five degrees to the S. of the Equator.<br/>
Throughout nearly the whole of its course the river is navigable,<br/>
with two great interruptions only (at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abfi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hammed-Barkal </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Donlrola-Widi </span>Halfa). Though it is greatly surpassed by the Amazon and Congo in volume, neither these nor any other river in the<br/>
world can vie in historical and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ethnographical </span>interest with the<br/>
'father of rivers'.<br/>
<br/>
The discovery of the true sources of the Nile and the cause of<br/>
its <span style="color: #ff0000;">animal </span>overflow are two <span style="color: #0000FF;">Scientific </span>problems which for upwards<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2000 </span>years European <span style="color: #0000FF;">scholars </span>laboured to solve, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the Egyptians themselves regarded the river as a deity, and its origin and<br/>
properties as the most sacred of mysteries, to be revealed to the<br/>
curious spirit of man only when he should have quitted this earthly<br/>
scene. As it is the Egyptian Nile only with which we have at<br/>
present to deal, we shall advert but briefly to the subject of the<br/>
sources of the river, and mention the principal affluents only <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>affect Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The Nile is formed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confluence </span>of the White and the Blue<br/>
Nile at the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartfrm</span>, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>point to its principal<br/>
months at Damietta and Rosetta, a distance of upwards of 1800<br/>
miles, it traverses an absolutely barren <span style="color: #0000FF;">country </span>and receives one<br/>
tributary only, the Atbara, on the east side, about 180 miles below<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lihartfim</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Throughout the whole of this distance, in the course of<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>falls <span style="color: #ff0000;">1940 </span>ft., the river has to contend against numerous<br/>
absorbing <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences</span>, for which it receives no compensation beyond<br/>
the rare showers attracted in winter by the mountains between<br/>
its right bank and the Red Sea. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nothwithstanding </span>the immense<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">length </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>river, it very rarely presents the picturesque appearance<br/>
of some of the great European and other rivers, as its banks are<br/>
generally flat and monotonous, and it contains hardly a single island<br/>
worthy of mention. The broadest parts of this portion of the Nile<br/>
are a little below <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartfim</span>, a little above its bifurcation near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Calm</span>,<br/>
and also near Minyeh, at each of which places it attains a width of<br/>
about 1100 yds., while the White <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">greater </span>breadth throughout<br/>
a long part of its lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">course </span>As the river pursues its tortuous<br/>
course through thirsty land, for a distance of 15 degrees <span style="color: #ff0000;">oflatitude</span>,<br/>
much <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofits </span>water is consumed by evaporation <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">infiltration </span>(a process by which it is probable that Libyan oases are supplied with<br/>
water from the Nubian Nile), and still more so by the extensive<br/>
system of <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>canals requisite for the irrigation of a whole<br/>
kingdom. M. Linant estimates this loss at the time of the inundation within Egypt proper, Le. between Gebel Selseleh and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>,<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-third </span>of the total volume; <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>found that <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,093,340,922 </span>cubic <span style="color: #0000FF;">metres </span>of water passed Gebel Selseleh <span style="color: #0000FF;">in'24 </span>hrs., while on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
