regard to the succession to the throne (p. 96), which seriously<br/>
disturbed the peace of the city, the fame of Alexandria, as the<br/>
greatest centre of commerce in the world and the chief seat of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek<br/>
</span>learning, steadily increased, and in <span style="color: #ff0000;">13.0</span>. 48, when the Romans<br/>
interfered in the quarrels of Cleopatra VII. and her husband and<br/>
brother Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">XIV</span>, had reached its zenith. After the murder of<br/>
Pompey at Pelusium, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cesar </span>entered Alexandria in triumph (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">98</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>,<br/>
but was attacked by the citizens and the army of Ptolemy XIV., and<br/>
had considerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>in maintaining <span style="color: #ff0000;">himselfin </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bruchium<br/>
</span>p. 209). During the siege of the city occurred the irreparable<br/>
(calamity ofthe burning of the Great Library of the Museum, but it<br/>
was afterwards to some extent replaced by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pergamenian </span>collection, presented to Cleopatra by Antony. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesar </span>was afterwards<br/>
conquered by the charms of the Egyptian queen, but Antony fell<br/>
more fatally into her toils, and spent years <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">revelry </span>with her at<br/>
Alexandria (<span style="color: #0000FF;">camp</span>. p. 98). Augustus treated Alexandria with <span style="color: #0000FF;">clemency</span>, and enlarged it by the addition of the suburb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nicopolis<br/>
</span>on the E. side of the city.<br/>
<br/>
Under the successors of Augustus, Alexandria was almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">uninterruptedly </span>the scene of sanguinary civil dissensions, caused<br/>
chiefly by the Jews, who in the reign of Tiberius constituted onethird of the whole population. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">A.D. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">69 </span>Vespasian was proclaimed<br/>
emperor by the Alexandrians, his election having been to a great<br/>
extent due to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of the philosophers <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dian</span>, Euphrates,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Apollonius </span>of Tyana, and others then resident at the Museum.<br/>
Under the following emperors also the sciences continued to flourish<br/>
at Alexandria. In the reign <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofHadrian</span>, Valerius Pollio and his son<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Diodorus</span>, and Apollonius Dyscolus, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">grammarians</span>, Ptolemy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Chennus</span>, the mythographer, Appian, the historian, and Claudius<br/>
Ptolemy, the astronomer, lived at Alexandria; and the emperor<br/>
himself, who visited the city twice, held public disputations with<br/>
the professors at the Museum. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">AD</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">176 </span>Marcus Aurelius came<br/>
to Alexandria for the purpose of quelling an insurrection, but treated<br/>
the citizens with great leniency, and attended the lectures of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">grammariaus </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Athenzeus</span>, Harpocration, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hephzestion</span>, Julius Pollux,<br/>
and others. Lucian also lived at Alexandria at this period, in the<br/>
capacity of secretary to the prefect <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>. In the reign of Marcus<br/>
Aurelius the Temple of Serapis <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>burned down, but the library<br/>
escaped without injury, and the temple was soon rebuilt. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">190<br/>
</span>Severus visited Alexandria, and established a senate and a new<br/>
municipal constitution. The visit of Caracalla, whom the citizens<br/>
had previously derided, was fraught with disaster. Having attracted<br/>
the whole of the male population capable of bearing arms to one<br/>
spot, he caused them to be massacred in cold blood. He closed the<br/>
theatres and the public <span style="color: #0000FF;">50110015</span>, and to prevent future rebellions<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>caused a wall fortified with towers to be erected between the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bruchium </span>and the rest of the city<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
