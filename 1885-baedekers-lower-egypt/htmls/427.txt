<span>of Cairo. MEMPHIS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">J</span>. Route. 375<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">head-dress </span>(pshent) with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Uracus </span>snake, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whichis </span>crowned with a<br/>
cylinder sloping slightly outwards, and resembling the modius in<br/>
the head of Serapis. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>beard is attached to the chin.<br/>
On his breast the king wears a shield terminating in a groove at the<br/>
top (perhaps a kind <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pouch</span>, such as were worn by the Jewish priests<br/>
and those of Serapis), in the centre of which is inscribed his pronomen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-user</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ma </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">setep </span>en <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.'god of the sun, mighty in the<br/>
truth, approved by the sun', <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>the god Ptah (<span style="color: #0000FF;">y</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span>, and the<br/>
lion-headed Sekhet (Bast) stand by as bearers; the girdle, in<br/>
which a dagger is worn, bears both the <span style="color: #ff0000;">prenomen </span>and the surname<br/>
of Ramses, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">favourite </span>of Ammon, which is also inscribed on the<br/>
front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scroll </span>or staff which he holds in his left hand. On<br/>
the back of the support of the left leg, which is in the attitude of<br/>
stepping forward, are two vertical rows of hieroglyphics, the lower<br/>
parts of which are broken off: <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1st </span>Line:'the princess and<br/>
great...'; <span style="color: #0000FF;">2nd </span>Line:'the king's <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">daughter</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, the great<span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span>'<br/>
These fragments of inscriptions show that the figure of a daughter<br/>
of the king was placed at his feet. The figure of a son is still<br/>
distinctly recognisable, the arm being raised in an attitude of<br/>
prayer, and the hand touching the knee of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">statue</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>There<br/>
can be no doubt that this statue, the face of which, when erect,<br/>
was turned towards the N., is one of those erected by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>front of the temple <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofPtah </span>(p. 373) at Memphis. In the time<br/>
of Strabo it perhaps stood alone in the anterior court, which was<br/>
used for bull-fights.'A colossal statue of a single stone', he observes,'stands in the entrance court before the temple of Ptah.<br/>
Bull-fights were exhibited here, for which express purpose some<br/>
persons keep <span style="color: #0000FF;">bulls</span>, as horse-trainers rear horses'. According to<br/>
Herodotus two of these statues were 30 cubits in height, which, as<br/>
the Greek cubit was only about <span style="color: #ff0000;">13/9 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>in length, nearly corresponds<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">42 </span>ft. which the statue actually measures. Both Herodotus and Diodorus state that Sesostris <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>), on his <span style="color: #0000FF;">return </span>from a great and victorious campaign, was invited at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the Egyptian frontier, with his wife and children, to a banquet<br/>
at the house of his brother. The latter, desiring to assassinate<br/>
Ramses, caused his tent to be surrounded with dry reeds after<br/>
the banquet<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and to be set on fire. The intoxicated servants rendered <span style="color: #0000FF;">inefficient </span>aid, and the king's wife and children were in the<br/>
utmost danger. The king<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>thereupon, raised his hands in prayer,<br/>
dashed into the flames, and rescued them. Out of gratitude he<br/>
then erected this statue, at the foot of which the figures ofa prince<br/>
and princess were placed. Accessory figures of a similar kind,<br/>
however, are frequently found with other statues to which no such<br/>
story attaches.<br/>
<br/>
Close to the statue, on the left, in front of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">felle'th-hut</span>, are<br/>
remains <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>statue, <span style="color: #0000FF;">including </span>a colossal foot, which, however, being<br/>
of sandstone, probably did not belong to the statue of Ramses, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
