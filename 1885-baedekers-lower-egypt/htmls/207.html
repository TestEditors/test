<span style="color: #ff0000;">ypttethrttl </span>columns or pilasters round the open court (see plan of the<br/>
mosques of (Amr, p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">3'24</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bari </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">b</span>, p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">9°52</span>); and (<span style="color: #0000FF;">2</span>) those<br/>
which have a rectangular or cruciform court surrounded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>closed<br/>
rooms, like the mosque of Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lawn </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>of the tomb<br/>
mosques, or those where the tomb is of <span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>size compared with the<br/>

<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOMBS </span>of the Muslims (comp. also p. 155) are generally<br/>
situated on high ground, <span style="color: #ff0000;">uninfluenccd </span>by the moisture ofthe river,<br/>
and sometimes in the desert. The chambers are destitute of decoration. Within is a catafalque of stone resting on a <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>or less decorated pedestal, and bearing two upright columns (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shc'thid</span>) of marble<br/>
or other stone, one of which, placed immediately over the head of<br/>
the deceased, bears <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>and age, with texts from the Koran. At<br/>
the top of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shfihid </span>is represented the turban of the deceased, the<br/>
form of which indicates his rank<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Over the catafalques of persons<br/>
of distinction are erected <span style="color: #0000FF;">dome-shaped </span>canopies, resting on four<br/>
columns or pilasters, or their tombs have the closed form of those<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékhs </span>already mentioned. On festivals the catafalques<br/>
and hollow parts of the pedestals are covered with palm-branches,<br/>
flowers, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">basilicum</span>. On these occasions the friends, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>the female relatives, of the deceased often spend whole days<br/>
by the tomb, engaged in prayer and <span style="color: #0000FF;">almsgiving</span>. For these mourners it was necessary to provide <span style="color: #0000FF;">accommodation</span>, and the result is<br/>
that a complete mausoleum, with its rooms for the family, sebil,<br/>
school, stables, custodian's residence, etc., is often nearly as extensive as the mosques themselves, while some of them are so large<br/>
as almost to present the appearance of a small deserted town. To<br/>
buildings of this kind the name <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofl.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sh </span>is applied. One of the most<br/>
imposing of these is the tomb-mosque of Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">liarlgfilg</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dwelling- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Houses</span>, which rarely have more than two<br/>
stories, are built in very various styles, but the following rules are<br/>
generally observed in their construction: <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>(1) The principal<br/>
rooms, particularly those of the Harem (p. 187), look into the court<br/>
or garden, if there be one. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">2</span>) The windows looking to the street<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">smaller </span>placed very high, and strongly barred, while those<br/>
of the upper floors are closed with mushrebiyeh (p. 181), which,<br/>
however, are gradually being superseded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">glass-windows </span>with<br/>
shutters. (3) The entrance-door LP ]. <span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>1<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l</span>), behind which is the<br/>
seat (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Aims-tuba</span>, Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2</span>) of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">doorkeeper</span>, is generally low and<br/>
narrow, and the passage (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>3) leading from the street to the<br/>
court is built <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>form <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>angle, to prevent people from seeing<br/>
into the court. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>) The court (<span style="color: #0000FF;">we</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">j</span>) is planted with trees and<br/>
unpaved, and contains a well of water that has filtered through from<br/>
the Nile. This water, however, is generally more or less brackish,<br/>
and is used only for washing purposes and for the cattle. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">P</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">By<br/>
