<span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>sale. A large crab, known as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er-rubbers</span>, which<br/>
is caught on the shore by moonlight <span style="color: #0000FF;">without </span>difficulty, is esteemed a<br/>
delicacy. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">tortnise-shell </span>yielded by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">loggerhead </span>turtle, and the<br/>
thick skin of the gild, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>dugong (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Helical-e </span>cetacea), form considerable<br/>
articles of commerce. According to some authorities the Jewish ark of<br/>
the covenant was covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">dugong </span>leather.<br/>
<br/>
HISTORY <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>SUEZ Little is known regarding the ancient history of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues</span>. A town mentioned for the first time by Lucian under the name<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Klysma</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">K'let'sma</span>, seems to have occupied this site <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>a very early<br/>
period. It was a fortified place, and the special task of the garrison<br/>
was to protect and maintain the old isthmus-canal completed by Darius<br/>
(p. 427). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaeus </span>calls the place Clysma <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pyaesidium</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>but places it<br/>
much farther to the S. During the supremacy of the Arabians, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">reopened </span>the old canal for a short time (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">428</span>), the town was named<br/>
Kolzum <span style="color: #0000FF;">0r </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kolzimt </span>After the 8th cent. it seems to have sunk into<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificance</span>, but it is mentioned by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahdulfida </span>as the starting-point for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tur </span>(p. 515<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>The chief historical interest attaching to the place lies<br/>
in the fact that it is usually supposed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>close to the point where the<br/>
Israelites crossed the Red Sea (comp. pp. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>, 483).<br/>
<br/>
Suez, a town with 11,170 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab.</span>, lies at the head of the gulf<br/>
of that name, one of the N. extremities of the Red Sea, and to<br/>
the S.W. of the mouth of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Canal. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the W. it is commanded by the picturesque blue heights of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Atilia </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mts.</span>, and<br/>
on the E. by hills belonging to the Asiatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">coast </span>range. Before the<br/>
construction of the great work of M. de Lesseps, Suez was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">miserable </span>Arabian village, with 1500 <span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab</span>. at most.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span>place', says Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schweinfurth </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1861</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'still </span>consists of confused<br/>
groups of miserable mud hovels, and ruinous, half-European buildings of<br/>
lath and plaster. On the quay rises the <span style="color: #ff0000;">one </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">» </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">storied </span>block of the English<br/>
hotel, in front of which are the iron railway shed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few warehouses,<br/>
and the consulates of the western powers. Such is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">poverty </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">» </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">stricken<br/>
</span>appearance of the town, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>moreover a deathlike stillness prevails,<br/>
notwithstanding the fact that three different quarters of the globe join<br/>
hands over its walls. Not <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>tree, not a spring, not even the meagre<br/>
saltwort, or a trace of vegetation of any kind<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>is to be seen on the<br/>
extensive and flat coast or anywhere in the environs of the town. The<br/>
blue of the sky and the sea, where half-a-dozen steamers and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">few </span>sailing vessels are lying at anchor<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the only relief to the eye of the<br/>
spectator.'<br/>
<br/>
To this day the town presents a very dreary appearance, and<br/>
its trade has again greatly fallen off, the stimulus given to it by<br/>
the opening of the canal and the large docks having apparently<br/>
been transient. Neither the Arabian quarter with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">seven </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant </span>mosques, nor the streets of the European quarter, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>contain several buildings and warehouses of considerable size, present<br/>
any attraction. The Arabian bazaar is unimportant, but at the<br/>
entrance to it are stalls of beautiful shells and coral from the Red<br/>
Sea, for which exorbitant prices are asked (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">416 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. Near<br/>
the Suez Hotel are several stalls where Chinese articles are sold.<br/>
<br/>
On a mound of debris to the N. of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">towny </span>not far from the<br/>
station and the magazines of the'Peninsular and Oriental Steam<br/>
Navigation Company', is a kiosque of the Khedive, commanding a<br/>
fine view of the mountains of the peninsula of Sinai, the sea, the<br/>
harbour, and the town. The hill is called by the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">hmm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'OtTum</span>, and was probably the site of the ancient Kolzum <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see above).<br/>
