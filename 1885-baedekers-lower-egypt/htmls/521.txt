luxuriant crops <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>which the province is famous; while the westernmost part chiefly consists of sterile desert <span style="color: #0000FF;">land </span>To the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span>and N. of the<br/>
Birket el- Kurun rise precipitous limestone hills, beyond which lies the<br/>
immense sandy desert of Sahara. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fayum </span>must have been reclaimed<br/>
from the desert at a very early period, probably during the early empire,<br/>
in the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>as monuments of his period indicate<br/>
that he was perhaps the first of the Pharaohs who sought to regulate<br/>
the whole course of the Nile. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the Upper Nile Prof. Lepsius has<br/>
found Kilometers constructed by that monarch, and in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fayl'zm</span>, on<br/>
the site <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Labyrinth<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>a number of blocks of stone inscribed with his<br/>
name. The Greeks called him <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amino</span>, or Moeris, and believed that the lake<br/>
known to them <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lake </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maeris</span>', which they regarded as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>marvel of<br/>
engineering skill, was named after him. The word <span style="color: #0000FF;">mart</span>, however, is<br/>
the Egyptian for lake or overflow, so that the great basin of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fayl'im<br/>
</span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">simply'the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lake</span>'; and it was from his exertions in connection with<br/>
the irrigation <span style="color: #0000FF;">works </span>that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span>obtained the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ltlceris </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">\Ve<br/>
</span>learn from several <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>and from a papyrus <span style="color: #0000FF;">roll </span>treating of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Feyt'im</span>, that the province <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>known in the time of the Pharaohs as Ta<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">5112</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>the lake- <span style="color: #0000FF;">land </span>and that Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">llloeris </span>was called <span style="color: #0000FF;">han-t</span>, signifying<br/>
the discharge or posterior lake. On its bank rose the celebrated Labyrinth, which was probably renewed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bubastite </span>monarchs of the<br/>
22nd Dynasty. About the same period the town of Crocodilopolis, situated on Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mun-is</span>, and afterwards called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arsinoe</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>after the wife of Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philadelphus</span>, was so extended and embellished by Osorkon I. that<br/>
it is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'city </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0f </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Osorkoh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>' in the inscription on the celebrated<br/>
stole <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Piankhi. The whole province was at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lake- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">land</span>,<br/>
then the district of Crocodilopolis, and lastly the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Name</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">must </span>highly revered here was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">crouodile-headed </span>Sebek, the reptile sacred to whom was carefully tended in Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moeris </span>At the same<br/>
time the voracious and dangerous monster, notwithstanding the reverence<br/>
paid to <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>account of its connection with the inundation, was also<br/>
regarded as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Typhonic</span>, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Crocodilopolitan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nome </span>was therefore<br/>
passed over in the lists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">names </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>At the period preceding that of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Psarntikides </span>of the 26th Dynasty the Labyrinth appears to have been used<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>hall for great imperial assemblies. At the period of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies<br/>
</span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Running </span>the products of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayfim </span>were much extolled.'The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinuite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nome</span>', says <span style="color: #ff0000;">Straho</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'is </span>the most remarkable <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">all</span>, both <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">account </span>of its scenery and its fertility and cultivation. For it alone is<br/>
planted with large, <span style="color: #0000FF;">full-grown</span>, and richly productive <span style="color: #0000FF;">olive-trees</span>, and the<br/>
oil is <span style="color: #ff0000;">good </span>when carefully prepared; those who are neglectful may indeed obtain oil in abundance, but it has <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>smell. In the rest of<br/>
Egypt the <span style="color: #ff0000;">olive </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Â» </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tree </span>is never seen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">except </span>in the gardens of Alexandria,<br/>
where under favourable circumstances they yield olives, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>oil. Vines,<br/>
corn, podded plants, and many other products also thrive in this district<br/>
in no small abundance<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">qtrabos </span>description is still applicable at the<br/>
present day. The oranges and mandarins, peaches<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>olives, figs, cactus<br/>
fruit, pomegranates, and grapes grown here are much esteemed, and the<br/>
beautiful, <span style="color: #ff0000;">rich-coloured </span>red roses of the gardens of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayfim</span>, which<br/>
were once so lavishly strewn at the banquets of Cleopatra, still thrive<br/>
here. At the station of Medinet <span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Fayfim </span>small phials of attar of roses,<br/>
of inferior quality, are frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>for sale. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'il </span>Pasha devoted<br/>
special attention to this favoured part of his dominions. The fields, which<br/>
are watered by means of wheels of peculiar construction, yield rice, sugar,<br/>
cotton, flax, and hemp, besides the usual cereals. The beginning of November is probably the season at which the traveller will obtain the most<br/>
distinct idea of the fertile character of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">district</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The Inhabitants<br/>

The RAILWAY JOURNEY is preferable to the voyage up the Nile<br/>
in point of speed, and the passenger obtains <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>good <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
