reach the interior by traversing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Liwan</span>. The<br/>
mosque originally had two entrances from each of the three outer<br/>
courts <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">see </span>Plan). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sahn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ol-Crime</span>, which we first enter, is a<br/>
spacious quadrangle, 99 yds. square. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">dome-covered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">structure<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">O </span>in the centre was destined to be the tomb of the founder;<br/>
but, as he died in Syria (see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">965</span>), it was fitted up as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">1iauefiyeh</span>, or basin for <span style="color: #0000FF;">ablution </span>before prayer, and still serves that purpose.<br/>
<br/>
On the N., <span style="color: #0000FF;">W.</span>, and S. sides of the court of the mosque run<br/>
arcades, which were at one time converted into cells for the reception of paupers and cripples. The character of the building, which<br/>
must once have presented a very imposing and harmonious appearance, has thus been seriously injured. The Arabian historians<br/>
relate that Ahmed was so charmed with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice </span>when completed<br/>
that he presented the architect with 10,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">dinars</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>is said<br/>
to have defrayed the whole of the cost of its construction out of<br/>
one of the treasures found by him (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">103</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The pointed arches of the arcades are <span style="color: #0000FF;">slightly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">depressed</span>, and have<br/>
a tendency towards the horseshoe form, a shape which is completely<br/>
developed in the lower stories of the minaret (see <span style="color: #0000FF;">below</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Between<br/>
the openings of the arcades are introduced pointed arches or niches,<br/>
partly for purposes of support, and partly by <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>of ornament.<br/>
The central pillars, which fell in 1814, once bore marble tablets<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cutie </span>inscriptions, recording the date of the building of the<br/>
mosque, but these have since been destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Liwan</span>, or Sanctuary, on the E. side, through which we<br/>
have entered the building, contains five series of arcades, and in<br/>
each of the other sides of the court there are two series. With a<br/>
view to exclude all sound of the outside world, the external wall<br/>
of this chamber of prayer was separated from the street by a row<br/>
of shops, and the three other sides were isolated by the introduction<br/>
of outer courts beyond them, enclosed by lofty walls (see Plan).<br/>
<br/>
All the angles in the interior are filled with columns built into<br/>
the walls, extending <span style="color: #0000FF;">two-thirds </span>of the way up, without bases, and<br/>
with imperfectly defined capitals in plaster. At certain places in<br/>
the pillars and the masonry longitudinal beams of wood have been<br/>
introduced for the purpose of strengthening the building, but they<br/>
are visible only where the external <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation </span>has fallen off. The<br/>
perforated attics, the gratings of stucco, the ornamentation, and<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cutie </span>inscriptions in stucco are all executed in strict conformity<br/>
with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Byzantine-Arabian </span>style. In the Kibla (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, however,<br/>
we observe two marble columns with capitals of more pronounced<br/>
Byzantine form. The upper part of the niche is adorned with gilded<br/>
mosaic, and the lower part with inlaid marble, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>above is a<br/>
dome with stalactites. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">*</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">LO</span>, a masterpiece of <span style="color: #0000FF;">wood-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">carving</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>was probably restored when the mosque was repaired by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Melik </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ol-Mans</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>in the year <span style="color: #ff0000;">696 </span>of the Hegira<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
