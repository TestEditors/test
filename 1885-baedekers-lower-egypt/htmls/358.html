it, to the Muslim tamily of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abl'i </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Radab</span>. In 485 of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llegira </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">All</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1092 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">thimite </span>Khalif Mustansir <span style="color: #ff0000;">Billfih </span>(1036-91) caused the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kilometer </span>to be<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span>with a dome. resting on columns, but that structure was destroyed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the siege of this part of the island by the French under Napoleon.<br/>
A <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof </span>in Turkish taste, resting on wooden columns, now covers the well.<br/>
<br/>
Adjoining the Nilometer is a large Kiosque in the Turkish style,<br/>
which may be inspected when not occupied by any harem. The<br/>
architecture is uninteresting, but the handsome dimensions of the<br/>
rooms, which are intended for a summer residence, and the bath<br/>
are worthy of notice. The S. verandah of the kiosque affords an<br/>
uninterrupted <span style="color: #ff0000;">*Vicw </span>of the Nile, with Gizeh to the right, the pyramids in the background<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and Old Cairo on the left (fee 1 fr.).<br/>
<br/>
Near the N. end of the island stands the wonder-working tree of the<br/>
saint <span style="color: #ff0000;">illangl√©ra</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>a huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">m'hk </span>tree, the branches of which are hung with<br/>
innumerable rags. According to a popular superstition the patient <span style="color: #0000FF;">must<br/>
</span>thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>to the saint the cloth which enveloped the affected limb, then<br/>
encircle the tree seven times, pluck off two leaves, and tie them on the<br/>
affected part with another cloth.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the island and returning to the opposite bank, we regain the 01d Cairo road, and after 1/4 M. more we reach the end of<br/>
the bazaar of this small town. <span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'e </span>then turn to the left, and in<br/>
a few minutes reach a street running from N. to S. Turning to<br/>
the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cleft</span>), we observe on the right a distinct quarter of the town,<br/>
built on the ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fatty</span>?! (p. 241) within the precincts of an<br/>
ancient Roman Castle, formerly called Babylon. The plan of the<br/>
fortress is still traceable by means of the numerous characteristic<br/>
remains of the Roman outer wall. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>side, between two<br/>
projecting towers, is a gateway with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">gabled </span>roof, now almost<br/>
entirely ruined. The castle is said once to have been occupied by<br/>
one of the three <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span>legions stationed in Egypt (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">241</span>), and<br/>
to have been connected by a bridge with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rotia </span>and with Gizeh,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>another <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span>station is said to have been situated. Proceeding in a straight direction for about <span style="color: #0000FF;">100 </span>yds., and then about<br/>
35 paces to the right of a low doorway situated in a hollow on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>side and concealed by a small wall, we reach the middle of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>quarter, where, enclosed by a dense mass of houses, is<br/>
situated the much frequented<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mbd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sergeh</span>, or Coptic Church of St. Mary. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>A Coptic boy may<br/>
be engaged as a guide to the church; fee 1 <span style="color: #0000FF;">piastre</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>) According to<br/>
a wide-spread belief this church was built before the Mohammedan<br/>
conquest, and a legendary document preserved by the Coptic priests<br/>
places the date of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">erection </span>in the year <span style="color: #0000FF;">320 </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llegira</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fie</span>.<br/>
940 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ad</span>). A glance at the poor materials of the building, however,<br/>
with its wooden ceiling and heterogeneous columns, will at once<br/>
show the absurdity of this idea. The crypt. however, is undoubtedly<br/>
much older than the church and may very well date from a <span style="color: #ff0000;">preMohammedan </span>epoch. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sergeb </span>is probably equivalent to St. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sergius</span>. According to tradition, the Virgin and Child after their flight<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">mt </span>spent a month in the crypt of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">church </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hue </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Coptic </span>priests <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>expects a fee of <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>piastre <span style="color: #0000FF;">tariff </span>from each visitor<span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
