Now the construction of the Pyramid occupied twenty <span style="color: #0000FF;">years </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f. </span>Each<br/>
of the sides, which face the different points of the compass, for<br/>
there are four sides, measures eight plethra (820 ft.<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>and the height<br/>
is the same. It is covered with polished stones, well jointed, none<br/>
of which is less than thirty feet long.'<br/>
<br/>
'This pyramid was first built in the form of a flight of steps.<br/>
After the workmen had completed the pyramid in this form, they<br/>
raised the other stones (used for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>by means of<br/>
machines, made of short beams, from the ground to the first tier<br/>
of steps; and after the stone was placed there it was raised to the<br/>
second tier by another machine; for there were as many machines<br/>
as there were tiers of steps; or perhaps the same machine, <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>was<br/>
easily moved, was raised from one tier to the other, as it was required for lifting the stones. The highest part of the pyramid was<br/>
thus finished first, the parts adjoining it were taken next, and the<br/>
lowest part<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>next to the earth, was completed <span style="color: #ff0000;">lastff</span>. It was<br/>
recorded on the pyramid<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>in Egyptian writing, how many radishes,<br/>
onions<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and roots of garlic had been distributed among the workmen,<br/>
and if <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rightly </span>remember what the interpreter (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p.'13</span>) who read<br/>
the writing told <span style="color: #ff0000;">me </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hi</span>, the money they cost amounted to sixteen<br/>
hundred talents of silver <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>upwards of <span style="color: #0000FF;">3130,0001</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>this was really<br/>
the case, how much more must then have been spent on the iron<br/>
with which they worked, and on the food and clothing of the<br/>
workmen, seeing that they worked for the time already mentioned,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>believe that no shorter time could have been occupied with<br/>
quarrying and transporting the stones, and with the work and the<br/>
excavations under the surface of the earth.'<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'CheOps </span>is said to have reigned fifty years in Egypt, and to have<br/>
been succeeded in the kingdom by his brother Chephren. who acted<br/>
exactly in the same manner as his brother<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and who also erected a<br/>
pyramid, which, however, is not of so great dimensions (for we<br/>
measured this one <span style="color: #0000FF;">also</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. This pyramid does not contain subterranean chambers, nor is a channel conducted to it from the Nile<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comp </span>p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">3560</span>. Chephren constructed the foundations of coloured<br/>
Ethiopian stone (granite of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>), but the pyramid was forty<br/>
feet lower than the other, <span style="color: #0000FF;">heat </span>which he erected it; for both <span style="color: #0000FF;">stand<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>It is not quite clear whether Herodotus means that the 100,000<br/>
men were <span style="color: #0000FF;">occupied </span>20 or 30 years in building the Pyramid of Cheops,<br/>
as he does not say whether <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>was the building above the subterranean<br/>
chambers. or the whole of the structure, that took twenty years.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>This account of the mode in which the pyramid was constructed<br/>
has been entirely confirmed by modern investigations (<span style="color: #0000FF;">cump</span>. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">3301.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ttt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>inscriptions, now destroyed, really once existed on the outside<br/>
of the pyramid, they doubtless contained much more important information than <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>which the interpreter professed to read. It is<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">more<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">over</span>, unlikely that the interpreters, who attended <span style="color: #0000FF;">traveller </span>like the<br/>
dragomans of the present day, were able to read hieroglyphics. They<br/>
probably repeated more popular traditions regarding the pyramids and<br/>
other monuments, with embellishments and exaggerations of their own<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
