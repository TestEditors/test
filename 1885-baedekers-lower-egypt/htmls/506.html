<span>444 Route 8. <span style="color: #0000FF;">DAMIETTA</span>. Towns of the<br/>
<br/>
The town contains no attractions. The principal mosque is a<br/>
huge, shapeless <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, the only redeeming features of which are<br/>
the lofty minarets and the spacious dome. All the houses of more<br/>
stories than one are provided with handsomely carved wooden jutties and lattice-work, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">differ </span>materially in style from the<br/>
mushrebiyehs of Cairo. The principal street, which is upwards of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>M. long, forms the busy and well-stocked bazaar of the place.<br/>
<br/>
An interesting excursion may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>made to the mosque of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ElGehtnseh</span>, situated near a cemetery, to the N. of the town (seebelow).<br/>
The building appears to date from the period of the old town of<br/>
Damietta, and has <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cutie </span>inscriptions in front<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The interior <span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span>numerous columns dating from the Roman period, the bases<br/>
of which are about <span style="color: #ff0000;">3ft</span>. below the level of the pavement of the<br/>
nave. Two of the columns bear curious inscriptions. Some of the<br/>
shafts are of beautiful verde <span style="color: #0000FF;">entice</span>, and others of porphyry. The<br/>
capitals, including several in the Corinthian style, are partly of<br/>
Roman and partly of Byzantine workmanship. Two columns standing <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the same base are believed, like those in the Mosque of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rAmr </span>at Cairo, to possess miraculous powers. (Fever-patients, for<br/>
example, are said to be cured by licking one of them.) The minaret<br/>
is embellished with early Arabian ornamentation.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">About </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3/4 </span>M. farther from the town is a hollow containing a<br/>
cemetery and a number of brick houses. The soil here and on the<br/>
slopes of the adjoining hills is of a dark red colour, whence the place<br/>
derives its name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buhr </span>ed-Dem, or'sea of blood'. According to<br/>
tradition, 30,000 martyrs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Isl√©m </span>were once massacred here.<br/>
The neighbouring hills, particularly those on the right, are called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tell </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plur</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">tuli'tl</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Agm</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span>", being said to contain<br/>
multitudes of human skeletons. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Reminiscences </span>of the siege of<br/>
Damietta by the Crusaders in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1219</span>, and of the victory gained here<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rAli </span>over the Turks in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1803 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>are curiously mingled<br/>
in the minds of the natives, and have given rise to various unfounded legends. It is not improbable that part of ancient Damietta once stood on the Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-'Ayn</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Sportsmen and fishermen will find much to repay them in a visit to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Damietta </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lake </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Menzaleh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A35</span>), <span style="color: #ff0000;">3/</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>M. distant. The town is built on<br/>
both banks of the arm of the Nile, the deposits of which have formed <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>terrace-like embankment, sloping down to the deeply indented salt lakes<br/>
at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">month </span>of the river. In the environs are extensive fields <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rice</span>, the<br/>
harvest of which takes place in Sept. and Oct. The fields are intersected<br/>
in every direction by <span style="color: #0000FF;">culling</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>and canals, which are crossed by numerous bridges <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the use of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cattle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cum </span>are extensively reared here,<br/>
and the milk and butter of Damietta are the best in Egypt. A walk in<br/>
the environs will <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>found interesting. The fields are pleasantly shaded<br/>
at intervals with plantations of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sycamores</span>, Cordia<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and other trees.<br/>
The ditches are filled with beautiful white and blue water-lilies (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nymphaea </span>Lotus, N. <span style="color: #ff0000;">czerulea</span>, and N. stellata) and other aquatic plants. The<br/>
larger canals are bordered with lofty reeds, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">haunt </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">iehncnmon</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>often surprises the traveller by its tameness. Notwithstanding<br/>
its <span style="color: #ff0000;">girdle </span>of inundated plains, canals, and lakes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damietta </span>enjoys a.<br/>
remarkably healthy climate at all <span style="color: #ff0000;">seasons</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">atmosphere </span>is never <span style="color: #0000FF;">so<br/>
