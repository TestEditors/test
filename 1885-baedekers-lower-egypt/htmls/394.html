<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">345 </span>Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">J</span>. THE PYRAMIDS <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gillan</span>. Environs<br/>
<br/>
said to have erected them for their wives. These works are unquestionably the most remarkable in all Egypt, whether in respect<br/>
of the size of the buildings and their cost, or the skill <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>artists.<br/>
And it is thought that the architects deserve even more admiration<br/>
than the kings who defrayed the cost; for the former contributed to<br/>
the completion of the work by mental power and praiseworthy exertion, but the latter only by the wealth they had inherited and the<br/>
labour of <span style="color: #0000FF;">others </span>Neither the natives, however, nor the historians<br/>
at all agree in their accounts of the pyramids. For some maintain<br/>
that they were built by these three kings, and others that they were<br/>
built by different persons'.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>'s account is remarkably graphic and <span style="color: #0000FF;">concise</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ur </span>you<br/>
go l'orty stadia from the city (of Memphis), you come to a hill on<br/>
which stand many pyramids, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">burial-places </span>of kings. Three are<br/>
particularly remarkable, and two of these are even reckoned among<br/>
the seven wonders. They are square in form and a stadium in height,<br/>
and this height is only slightly greater than the length of each<br/>
side. One pyramid, too, is a little larger than the other. A<br/>
moderate distance up one of its sides, this pyramid has a stone<br/>
which can be taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>When it is removed, an oblique passage<br/>
within leads to the tomb. These pyramids are near each other in<br/>
the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>space; and a little higher up the hill is the third,<br/>
much smaller than <span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span>two, but erected in a much more costly<br/>
style. For, from its foundation nearly up to the middle, it consists<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">black </span>stone, of which mortars are also made, and which is<br/>
brought from a long distance, namely from the mountains <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofEthiepin</span>. Owing to its hardness and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>of working it, the<br/>
building is rendered expensive".<br/>
<br/>
Strabo then speaks of the fossils resembling lentils, mentioned<br/>
at p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">336</span>, but does not share the view current at that period<br/>
that they were the <span style="color: #0000FF;">petrified </span>remains of the workmen's food. With<br/>
regard to <span style="color: #ff0000;">lthodopis</span>, who is mentioned at p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">346</span>, he tells the<br/>
following tradition, resembling the tale of the modern Cinderella.<br/>
While <span style="color: #ff0000;">llhodopis </span>was bathing, an eagle carried off one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>her shoes,<br/>
carried it to Memphis, and dropped it into the lap of the king, who<br/>
was then sitting on the judgment seat. The king, admiring the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">neatness </span>of the shoe, and surprised at the strangeness of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">occurrence</span>, sent out messengers to search for the owner of the shoe. She<br/>
was found at Naukratis and brought to the king, who made her his<br/>
wife, and on her death erected the third pyramid to her memory.<br/>
<br/>
Pliny speaks somewhat <span style="color: #0000FF;">slightingly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Pyramids :--<span style="color: #ff0000;">~'We<br/>
</span>must also in passing mention the Pyramids in this same Egypt, an<br/>
idle and foolish display by the kings of their wealth; and indeed,<br/>
as most persons maintain, they had no other object in erecting them<br/>
than to deprive their successors, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">rival</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>plotting against them,<br/>
of money, or perhaps for the purpose of keeping the people engaged.<br/>
The vanity of these people in this matter was very great<span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
