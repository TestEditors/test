<span>432 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">7</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">SIIALfiF</span>. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sue</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>which are dry at low tide, lie on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E.</span>, and others on the W. side<br/>
<br/>
of the ship's course. We pass a handsome pier on the left, from<br/>
<br/>
the S. side of which the navigable channel to Suez, bordered by<br/>
shallows, branches <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W.l </span>and then, nearly in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">latitude </span>of Suez, we enter the mouth of the canal. On that part of I<br/>
the W. bank of which the Canal has made an island by separating<br/>
it from the mainland, rise the workshops and coal magazines of the<br/>
company and the quarantine establishment. At low tide the shallows in the N. part of the gulf are visible, and a series of islands<br/>
is always to be seen at the extremity of the gulf, which, but for the<br/>
Canal, might be crossed on foot at low tide. On the westernmost<br/>
island, situated opposite the railway station and the hotel, is an<br/>
old burial-ground, and on a larger island farther to the E. are the<br/>
company's furnaces and workshops.<br/>
<br/>
At the 150th kilometre (the <span style="color: #ff0000;">83rd </span>on the fresh-water canal) the<br/>
desert rises in a slight eminence, on which lie a number of huge<br/>
granite blocks, the remains of two monuments erected here by Darius, during the Persian period, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>still bearing <span style="color: #0000FF;">trace</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of hieroglyphics and of the Persian cuneiform characters.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">They </span>were doubtless intended to arrest the eye of the passenger travelling through the canal, and were therefore of imposing dimensions,<br/>
and placed on a massive pedestal. The bed of the ancient canal is, moreover, traceable in the neighbourhood. It does <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>seem to me probable<br/>
that Darius should have limited <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the three monuments of which<br/>
there are still remains, particularly as the distance between the second<br/>
and third (at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shali1f </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serapeum </span>respectively) is much greater than<br/>
that between the first and second. One other monument at least may therefore be supposed to have stood between the second and third.... These<br/>
three monuments have been destroyed by violence, perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">during </span>the<br/>
successful rising of the Egyptians in the reign of Artaxerxes, or after<br/>
they had finally shaken <span style="color: #ff0000;">oil</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>the Persian yoke. Fire, which is very injurious to granite, seems to have been used in destroying them'. <span style="color: #ff0000;">_</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

red and brown with iron, had to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>removed in the course of the<br/>
excavation of the Canal, and interesting geological formations have<br/>
been brought to light (comp. p. 00).<br/>

not only does its lowest stratum contain numerous teeth and <span style="color: #ff0000;">vertebra </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of<br/>
