for sowing by the use of the plough. The seed is scattered over the<br/>
still soft and moist soil, and is then either pressed into it by means<br/>
of a wooden roller, beaten into it with pieces of wood, or trodden<br/>
in by <span style="color: #0000FF;">oxen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>. Throughout the whole country a period of four<br/>
months elapses between seed-time and the completion of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">harvest</span>. The winter harvest is, therefore, over in Upper Egypt about the<br/>
middle of February, in Central Egypt about the middle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">March<br/>
</span>and in the Delta towards the end of April. In Upper and Central<br/>
Egypt this is the most important harvest of the whole year. The<br/>
principal crop everywhere is wheat (occupying <span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0/0 </span>of the fields<br/>
in Upper Egypt and 30 0/0 in the Delta), next to which are barley<br/>
(in the proportion of <span style="color: #ff0000;">10 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0/0 </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">1-1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0/0 </span>in these regions respectively),<br/>
clover (100/0 and 2-1 0/0 respectively), and broad beans <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>0/0 and<br/>
120/0 respectively).<br/>

varied than those of winter, but they are comparatively unimportant<br/>
in Upper and Central Egypt, as the cultivable land in these regions<br/>
is very narrow, and belongs <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>to the'ltai' category, two-thirds<br/>
of it being under water during summer. In the Delta, on the other<br/>
hand, summer is the farmer's most important season. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">vegetation </span>with which its whole surface is densely clothed in June and<br/>
July is marvellously rich and beautiful, thousands of magnificent<br/>
trees clustered in groups <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span>delightful shelter from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fierce<br/>
</span>rays of the sun, and the eye ranges over an immense expanse teeming with luxuriant crops. Another charm of the country in summer<br/>
consists in its abundantly stocked gardens and orchards: but of all<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span>attractions the traveller who, like a bird of passage, merely<br/>
seeks refuge in Egypt from the cold and rains of a northern winter<br/>
cannot possibly form any adequate idea. At this season every dis<br/>

</span>primitive and <span style="color: #0000FF;">detective </span>The chief of these is the plough (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Milo-tit</span>), the<br/>
form of which is precisely the same as it was 5000 years ago; and the<br/>
traveller will recognise it on many of the monuments and in the system<br/>

acute angle, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">shed </span>with a three-pronged piece of iron (<span style="color: #0000FF;">limo</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Connected </span>with the pole is the handle which is held by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tenth </span>These<br/>
