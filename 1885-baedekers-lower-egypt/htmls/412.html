<br/>
The three Small Pyramids situated to the S. of the Third <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramid </span>are uninteresting. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chamber </span>of the one in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">centre </span>also contains the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menkaura</span>, painted on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling<br/>
<br/>
</span>About 600 paces to the E. ofthe plateau of the Second <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pyramid</span>,<br/>
from amidst the sand of the desert, rises <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>Sphinx <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>which, next to the Pyramids themselves, is the most<br/>
famous monument in this vast burial-ground. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is hewn out of<br/>
the natural rock, and where this material has failed it has been<br/>
moulded into the shape of a recumbent lion with the head <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>man. The body was left in a rough form, but the head was originally most carefully executed. The entire height of the monument,<br/>
from the crown of the head to the pavement on which the fore-legs<br/>
of the lion rest, is said to be (see <span style="color: #0000FF;">below</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, but the head, neck,<br/>
and a small part of the back are generally alone visible, the rest<br/>
being concealed by the constantly shifting sand. The ear, according<br/>
to Mariette, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">41/2 </span>ft., the nose 5 ft. 7 in., and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">month </span>7 ft.<br/>
7 in. in length; and the extreme breadth of the face is 13 ft.<br/>
8 inches. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>the traveller stands on the upper part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ear</span>, he<br/>
cannot <span style="color: #0000FF;">stretch </span>his hand as far as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crown </span>of the head, and the<br/>
space between these points must have been greater when the <span style="color: #ff0000;">headdeeoration</span>, which, as well as the greater part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beard</span>, is now<br/>
broken off, was still intact. There is a hollow in the head, into<br/>
which one of the Arabs may <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>desired to climb. The face was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">deplorably </span>mutilated at a comparatively recent period by a fanatic,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">iconoclastic </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sli√©kh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and afterwards by the barbarous <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mamelultes</span>.<br/>
who used it as a target. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>would appear <span style="color: #0000FF;">from'Abdellatif</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">343<br/>

face is very pleasing, and is of a graceful and beautiful type; one<br/>
might almost say that it smiles winningly'. He also describes the<br/>
proportions of the head very minutely. An older writer, however<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>states that the nose was mutilated in his time, and, as it is now<br/>
entirely destroyed, the face somewhat resembles the negro type,<br/>
though the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mouth </span>still has a smiling appearance. The stone formerly had a reddish tint which has now entirely disappeared. The<br/>
Arabs have given the Sphinx the name <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'abn'l </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hol</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.c</span>.'father<br/>

his intelligence in his eyes, or'the watchful'. This last expression<br/>
has frequently been used, by authors who were ignorant of its antiquity, as an appropriate epithet for the Sphinx. The Arabs believed that the figure possessed the supernatural power of preventing the encroachment of the sand. The complete excavation of the<br/>
Sphinx was <span style="color: #ff0000;">llrst </span>undertaken by <span style="color: #ff0000;">L1aviglia </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">351</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>), at the cost<br/>
