more ancient and materially different period of development. At<br/>
the same time a careful inspection of the monuments of this period<br/>
will convince the observer that no farther development could be <span style="color: #0000FF;">expected </span>afterwards to take place on the basis of a system so lifeless<br/>
and entirely mechanical. Shortly before the conquest of the country<br/>
by the Persians, however, a slight improvement in artistic taste<br/>
appears to have taken place. While the monuments of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Twentysecond </span>and following Dynasties are unattractive, being mere<br/>
reproductions of earlier works, the sculptures of the Twenty-sixth<br/>
Dynasty (such as the alabaster statue of Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ameniritis </span>of the<br/>
XXV. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dynasty</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>exhibit a considerable degree of elegance and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">refinement</span>. But this revival was of brief duration. After the<br/>
establishment of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaaan </span>dynasty the native art became<br/>
entirely extinct, though for a time a semblance of life was <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">maintained</span>. Political interests required the restoration of the<br/>
temples, and numerous artists were employed for the purpose; the<br/>
traditional style continued to be practised, and every branch of art<br/>
was liberally <span style="color: #ff0000;">patronised</span>. The style of this period, however, had<br/>
well-nigh degenerated into <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mannerism</span>, and therefore does<br/>
not possess the historical interest attaching to the earlier stages of<br/>
Egyptian art.<br/>
<br/>
The art of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemzean </span>era, moreover, in spite of all its<br/>
richness and apparent vigour, not only shows manifest <span style="color: #ff0000;">symptomsof </span>decline, but was threatened with the loss of its originality<br/>
and independence owing to foreign influences. As soon as Hellas<br/>
came into contact with Egypt, the innate charms of Hellenic art,<br/>
which even remote India was unable to resist, began to affect the<br/>
hitherto strongly conservative and <span style="color: #0000FF;">self-satisfied </span>Egyptians.<br/>
<br/>
Having thus given a slight chronological outline of the progress of Egyptian art, we must now endeavour to supplement it by<br/>
a description of the chief characteristics of each period. Our<br/>
attention will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>directed to the monuments of the new<br/>
empire, owing to their great number and extent.<br/>
<br/>
The Column in Egypt, as elsewhere, constitutes the most important of all architectural members. Its absence indicates a very<br/>
elementary stage of the art of building, when artistic development<br/>
has yet to begin. The column imparts to the edifice an appearance<br/>
of organic life, it lightens and breaks the outline of its different<br/>
masses, and affords strength and <span style="color: #ff0000;">apportr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>compared with<br/>
the Greek columnar orders, the Egyptian column is of a very<br/>
imperfect character. Its decoration and its form do not immediately and exclusively express its proper <span style="color: #0000FF;">office</span>, as is the case with<br/>
the Greek column, and the Doric in particular. Its dependence on<br/>
its natural prototype, the wreath-crowned <span style="color: #0000FF;">canopy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">support</span>, still<br/>
continues apparent, and its proportions, though not altogether<br/>
independent of rule, still appear too arbitrary. Lastly, the height<br/>
and thickness of the columns do not stand in an appropriate<br/>
