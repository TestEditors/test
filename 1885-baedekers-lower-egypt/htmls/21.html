<span>INTRODUCTION.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>shall now speak at greater length of<br/>
Egypt, as it contains more wonders than<br/>
(my other land, and is <span style="color: #0000FF;">pve-eminent </span>above<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>the countries in the world for works<br/>
that one can hardly describe<span style="color: #0000FF;">?<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">HERODOTUS </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">B. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">C. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">456</span>).<br/>
<br/>
At the close of <span style="color: #0000FF;">let </span>century Egypt was in a great measure rediscovered by the French savants attached to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bonaparte</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Egyptian<br/>
expedition. Since that period it has attracted the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ever-increasing<br/>
</span>attention of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific</span>; its historical and archaeological marvels<br/>
have been gradually unveiled to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">world </span>it is the most ancient,<br/>
and was yet at one time the most civilised country of antiquity;<br/>
and it therefore cannot fail to awaken the <span style="color: #ff0000;">profoundest </span>interest in<br/>
all students of the history and development of human <span style="color: #0000FF;">culture<br/>
<br/>
</span>Like other countries of the far East, Egypt possesses for the<br/>
'Frank' traveller the twofold attraction of scenery and history. To<br/>
the first category belong the peculiar charms of its Oriental climate,<br/>
the singularly clear atmosphere, the wonderful colouring and effects<br/>
of light and shade, such as <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unknown </span>in more northern climates,<br/>
the exuberant fertility of the cultivated districts contrasted with the<br/>
solemn, awe-inspiring desert, and the manners, <span style="color: #0000FF;">customs </span>and appearance of a most <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>though not <span style="color: #0000FF;">always </span>pleasing, population. At the same time Egypt is <span style="color: #0000FF;">pre-eminent </span>among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">countries </span>of the East, and indeed among those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">world</span>, as the<br/>
cradle of history and of human culture. At every step we encounter venerable monuments which have survived the destructive<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>of thousands of years and the vandalism of invaders and<br/>
conquerors, and which are executed on so grand a scale, with so<br/>
much artistic skill, and with such historical consistency, as at<br/>
once to excite our highest admiration and command our most profound respect.<br/>
<br/>
Owing to its distance from the homes of most travellers, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>the expense involved in exploring it, Egypt will never be overrun<br/>
by tourists to the same extent as Switzerland or Italy; but it is now<br/>
reached without <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>by one of the numerous Mediterranean<br/>
steamboat lines, and increased facilities are afforded to travellers<br/>
by the recent construction of railways (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It</span>) within the country<br/>
itself, while its unrivalled attractions abundantly <span style="color: #0000FF;">reward </span>the enterprising traveller and supply him <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a subject <span style="color: #0000FF;">oflife- </span>long interest.<br/>
