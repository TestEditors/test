<span>38 GEOGRAPHICAL NOTICE. Population.<br/>
<br/>
domestic utensils employed by the ancient Egyptians, as well as<br/>
many of their customs, are similar to those of the dwellers on<br/>
the banks of the Zambezi and Niger, but totally different from<br/>
those seen on the banks of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Indus </span>or Euphrates, will always<br/>
maintain an opposite view. The considerations already mentioned,<br/>
however, tend to show that the truth lies between these extremes.<br/>
Even those who most strongly maintain the Asiatic origin of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span>will probably admit that the immigrants found<br/>
an aboriginal race already settled on the banks of the Nile, which<br/>
in its persistent opposition to all foreign influences was doubtless<br/>
similar to the race usually known as the Egyptian. We start with<br/>
the cardinal fact<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>that, although the country has been at various<br/>
periods overrun by <span style="color: #ff0000;">llyksos</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethiopians</span>, Assyrians, Persians, Greeks,<br/>
Romans, Arabs, and Turks, and although <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>people were <span style="color: #ff0000;">tyrannised </span>over, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ill-treated</span>, and in most cases compelled to intermarry<br/>
with these foreigners, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span>have for thousands of years<br/>
retained the same <span style="color: #0000FF;">unvarying </span>physical types, while their character<br/>
has been but slightly modified by the introduction of Christianity<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedanism</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>it now be borne in mind that these<br/>
foreigners generally invaded the country in the form of an army,<br/>
that they formed but a small body compared with the bulk of the<br/>
population, and that they either married native women or sought<br/>
wives in other countries, it is obvious that they would either <span style="color: #ff0000;">coutinne </span>to exist for a time as a foreign caste. a condition apparently<br/>
repugnant to nature and necessarily transient, or that they would<br/>
gradually succumb to the never-failing <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences </span>of the soil and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>absorbed in the great mass of the aboriginal inhabitants. An<br/>
excellent illustration of this process is afforded by the Arabian invasion, with the circumstances and results of which we are better<br/>
acquainted than with the history of the other foreign immigrations;<br/>
for<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>disregarding the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lleduin </span>tribes, who are entirely distinct from<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>population, we now find that the Arabian element<br/>
has entirely disappeared, and we meet with genuine Arabs in the<br/>
towns only, where the merchants, pilgrims, and other members of<br/>
that people form a class entirely distinct from the natives, and<br/>
where their existence is only maintained by means of reinforcements from abroad. Another proof of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">transforming</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">influences<br/>
</span>of the Egyptian climate is afforded by the uniform character of the<br/>
domestic animals. The oxen, in particular (which, however, are<br/>
gradually being replaced by the buffalo), though they have often<br/>
been repeatedly exterminated in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">single </span>century by murrain, and<br/>
have been succeeded by foreign races from every quarter of the<br/>
globe, invariably after a few generations assume the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-known<br/>
</span>Egyptian type with which the representations on the ancient temples<br/>
render us so familiar.<br/>

The Modern Egyptians. The population of Egypt is composed<br/>
