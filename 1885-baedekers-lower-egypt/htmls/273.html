had he closed his eyes and been succeeded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Foray</span>, when the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maniclukes </span>again <span style="color: #0000FF;">revolted</span>, and renewed conflicts took place for possession of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>citadel, during which the city was partly plundered. Similar scenes<br/>
were repeated on almost every change of government. The turbulence of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, who were always treated with too much consideration by<br/>
the sultans, now became more and more unbearable; <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>robbed the<br/>
people in the markets, assaulted citizens in the public streets, and grossly<br/>
insulted respectable women. Hitherto the outrages committed by these<br/>
troops had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>connected with some political object, but from<br/>
the middle of the 15th century downwards they were generally <span style="color: #0000FF;">perpetrated </span>with a view to plunder. Thus in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1453</span>, when fires repeatedly broke<br/>
out at Cairo and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bolalg</span>, it was generally believed that the Mamelukes<br/>
had caused them in order to obtain opportunities for robbery. In the<br/>
course of the following year they forcibly entered the mosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Amr </span>at<br/>
Old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo </span>on a Friday, and robbed the numerous Women who were then<br/>
attending divine service. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sultanate </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khoshhadem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0461437 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes </span>plundered the bazaars of Old Cairo, and in the reign of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammad </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">11196795</span>), son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kait-Bey</span>, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">roved </span>through the streets at<br/>
night, maltreated the police, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>plundered various quarters of the city.<br/>
In 1496, when rival emirs were almost daily fighting in the streets of<br/>
Cairo, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes </span>of course utilised the opportunity for plunder.<br/>
<br/>
On 26th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jan </span>1517, the Osman Sultan Selim <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, after having gained a<br/>
victory in the neighbourhood of Cairo, entered the <span style="color: #ff0000;">city</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tdman </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hey</span>,<br/>
the last <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>sultan<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>again gained possession of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ill-guarded </span>town<br/>
on 28th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jan</span>, but was obliged to evacuate it on the following day, and<br/>
was taken prisoner and executed (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">272</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. Before Selim returned to Constantinople, he caused the finest marble columns which adorned the<br/>
palace in the citadel to be removed to his own capital. Thenceforward Cairo became a mere provincial capital, and its <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">almost </span>an entire blank down to the period of the French expedition. On<br/>
22nd July, <span style="color: #0000FF;">17987 </span>after the Battle of the Pyramids, Cairo was occupied by<br/>
Bonaparte, who established his headquarters here for several months, and<br/>
who quelled with sanguinary severity an insurrection which broke out<br/>
among the populace on <span style="color: #0000FF;">23rd</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">25th </span>September. At the beginning of the<br/>
year 1799 Bonaparte started from Cairo on his Syrian expedition, and on<br/>
his return to France, Kléber was left as <span style="color: #ff0000;">eommander-in-chief </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthe </span>French<br/>
troops at Cairo, where he was assassinated on 14th June, 1800. In<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nut </span>the French garrison under Belliard, being hard pressed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>grand<br/>
vizier, was compelled to <span style="color: #ff0000;">capitulatc</span>. On 3rd August, 1805, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammad<br/>
</span>'Ali, as the recognised pasha of Egypt, took possession of the citadel,<br/>
which for the last time witnessed a bloody scene on ist March, 1811,<br/>
when <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>Beys were massacred by Mohammed's order. Since<br/>
then nothing has interrupted the peaceful development of the city.<br/>
