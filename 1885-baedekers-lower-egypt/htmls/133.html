works of every kind except dramas. The most ancient hieratic<br/>
papyrus now extant was written in the third millennium before<br/>
Christ. The language used in the hieroglyphic and hieratic writings alike was the ancient sacred dialect of the priests. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dcmotic </span>writing, which was first employed in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">9th </span>century<br/>
before Christ, diverges so widely from the hieroglyphic that in<br/>
some of the symbols the original sign from which they were derived is either not traceable, or can only be recognised with difficulty.<br/>
The sign of the owl, for example, was curtailed to D. This writing<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>used in social and commercial intercourse; as, for<br/>
example, in contracts and letters, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whence </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>was sometimes termed<br/>
the'letter character' by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">G'reeks</span>. The more the spoken language<br/>
diverged from the sacred dialect, which assumed a fixed form at a<br/>
very early period, the more urgent became the want of a new mode<br/>
of writing <span style="color: #0000FF;">appropriate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the living language. Thus arose the <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic<br/>
</span>style, and lastly, in the 3rd century after Christ, the Coptic, in<br/>
which the language spoken at that time by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Christian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians<br/>
</span>was written, the characters being Greek, with a few supplementary<br/>
symbols borrowed from the demotic (such as <span style="color: #ff0000;">{ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">15 </span>sh, q f<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">21</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>: <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">x </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">j</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">syllabic'l</span>' <span style="color: #ff0000;">it</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Many Coptic writings,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ol</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>a religious character, have been handed down to us, the<br/>
finest of them being the books of the Old and New Testament<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Down to the end of the 18th century scholars had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">misled<br/>
</span>in their endeavours to find a clue to the hieroglyphic writing by a<br/>
work of the Egyptian grammarian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horapollon</span>, translated into<br/>
Greek, who represented the characters as being purely symbolical,<br/>
and as having each an independent meaning <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofits </span>own. At length<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1799 </span>M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boussard</span>, a French <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer </span>of artillery, discovered at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosetta </span>a trilingual inscription <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lpp</span>. 449 et <span style="color: #0000FF;">ser</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic </span>characters and in Greek. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic </span>part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>was examined by M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Silvestre </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dc </span>Sacy, a French savant,<br/>
and Hr. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ackerblad</span>, a Swede, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1502</span>, and, chiefly owing to the<br/>
exertions of the latter, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">signification </span>of a number of the symbols<br/>
was ascertained. In 1814-18 the hieroglyphic part of the inscription was studied by Dr. Th. Young, an English scholar, who, by<br/>
comparing it with the demotic part, succeeded in dividing it into<br/>
a number of corresponding groups, and, by directing his attention to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">eartouches </span>(p. 117), discovered the signification of several of the<br/>
hieroglyphic symbols. In 1821 Francois <span style="color: #0000FF;">Champollion</span>, usually surnam'ed Le <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jenna</span>, who possessed an intimate acquaintance with the<br/>
Coptic language and literature, directed his attention to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>, and in the course of the following year discovered the<br/>
hieroglyphic alphabet, which afforded him a clue to the whole of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">file </span>ancient Egyptian literature. His method, which he has explained in his hieroglyphic grammar, though at first vehemently<br/>
opposed, soon obtained able adherents. who after his early death<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1832 </span>zealously took up and prosecuted the same line of research<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
