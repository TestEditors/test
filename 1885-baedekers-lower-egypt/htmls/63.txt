<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fcllvihint </span>THE MODERN <span style="color: #0000FF;">EGYPTIANS</span>. 41<br/>
<br/>
The agricultural population <span style="color: #ff0000;">ongypt </span>does not exceed two million<br/>
souls, an unnaturally low proportion when we consider the nature of<br/>
the country. The sole wealth <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span>is derived from its agriculture,<br/>
and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin </span>alone is committed the important task of tilling<br/>
the soil. They are, indeed, neither fitted nor inclined for other work,<br/>
a circumstance which proves how completely the stationary character<br/>
of the ancient Egyptians has predominated over the restless Arabian blood, which has been largely infused into the native population ever since the valley of the Nile was conquered by the armies<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ofEl-Islam</span>. The modern Egyptians, moreover, resemble the ancient<br/>
in the lot to which they are condemned. In ancient times the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fellah</span>, pressed into the service of the priests and the princes,<br/>
was compelled to yield up to them the fruits of his toil, and his<br/>
position is nearly the same at the present day<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>save that the names<br/>
of his masters are changed, and he has obtained some relief owing to the almost entire abolition of compulsory work.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>early life the Egyptian peasant is remarkably docile, active,<br/>
and intelligent, but at a later period this freshness and buoyancy is<br/>
crushed out of him by care and <span style="color: #0000FF;">poverty </span>and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">never-teasing </span>task<br/>
of filling the pitcher of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Danaides</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>ploughs and reaps, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tails<br/>
</span>and amasses, but he cannot with certainty regard his crops as his<br/>
own, and the hardly earned piastre is too frequently wrested from<br/>
him. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>character, therefore, becomes like that <span style="color: #0000FF;">oh </span>gifted child,<br/>
who has been harshly used and brought up to domestic slavery, but<br/>
at length perceives that he has been treated with injustice, and<br/>
whose amiability and intelligence are then superseded by sullenness<br/>
and obstinacy. Thus. as in the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ammianns </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Marcellinns</span>, the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fella </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>will often suffer the most cruel blows in dogged silence rather<br/>
than pay the taxes demanded of him.<br/>
<br/>
In his own fields the fellah is an industrious labourer, and his<br/>
work is more continuous than that of the peasant of more northern<br/>
countries. He enjoys no period of repose during the winter<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and the<br/>
whole of his spare time is occupied in drawing water for the irrigation of the land. Notwithstanding his hard lot, however, he is an<br/>
entire stranger to any endeavour to better his condition or to improve his system of farming. As soon as he has accomplished the<br/>
most necessary tasks he rests and smokes, and trusts that Allah will<br/>
do the remainder of his work for him.<br/>
<br/>
The fella }; is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">believer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the religion of Mohammed, although<br/>
he knows but little of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prophet</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>doctrines and history. Followers of all other religions he believes to be doomed to eternal perdition; but travellers are not on that account disliked by him. We<br/>
serve rather to confirm his belief in eternal justice, for he is convinced that all the comforts and luxuries we now enjoy will be<br/>
counterbalanced <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">torments </span>hereafter. At the same time he admires<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">over-rates </span>our knowledge, which is so superior to his own. Every<br/>
well-dressed European is in the estimation of the natives a <span style="color: #0000FF;">prodigy<br/>
