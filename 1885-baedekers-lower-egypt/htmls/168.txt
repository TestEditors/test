<br/>
their backs. The scales in which good <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>evil deeds are weighed<br/>
play an important part in <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">loci </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>the soul's fate, a detail which<br/>
gave rise to the subsequent doctrine of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">efficacy </span>of works. This<br/>
doctrine is carried so far that works of supererogation are believed<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>placed to the credit of the believer. The demons and animals,<br/>
too, must be judged. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall</span>, as well as heaven, has different regions;<br/>
and El-lslam also assumes the existence of a purgatory, from which<br/>
release is possible. Paradise is depicted by Mohammed, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">consonanee </span>with his thoroughly sensual character, as a place of entirely<br/>
material delights.<br/>
<br/>
The course of all events, including the salvation or perdition<br/>
of every individual, is, according to the strict interpretation of the<br/>
Koran, absolutely predestined; although several later sects have<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to modify this terrible doctrine. It is these views,<br/>
however, which give rise to the pride of the Muslims. By virtue of<br/>
their faith they regard themselves as certainly elect, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>as a rule<br/>
they make no attempt to convert others, as they have no power to<br/>
alter the irrevocable decrees of God.<br/>
<br/>
In the second place the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran </span>is considered to contain, not only a<br/>
standard of ethics, but also the foundation of a complete code of law.<br/>
<br/>
The MORALITY <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lil-lsliim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>specially adapted by its founder<br/>
to the character of the Arabs. Of duties to one's neighbour, charity<br/>
is the most highly praised, and instances of its practice are not<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">unfreqnent</span>. Hospitality is much practised by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins</span>, and by<br/>
the peasantry also in <span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span>districts which are not overrun with<br/>
travellers. Frugality is another virtue of the Arabs, though too apt<br/>
with them to degenerate into avarice and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cupidity</span>. The law <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">debtor<br/>
</span>and creditor is lenient. Lending money at interest is forbidden by<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lforan</span>, but is nevertheless largely practised, the lowest rate<br/>
in Syria being <span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>per cent. The prohibition against eating unclean<br/>
animals, such as swine, is older than <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-lslam</span>, and, like the prohibition of intoxicating drinks, is based on sanitary considerations.<br/>
Wine, however, and even brandy, are largely consumed by the upper<br/>
classes, especially among the Turks.<br/>
<br/>
Although POLYGAMY is sanctioned, every Muslim being permitted to have four wives at a time, yet among the bulk of the population monogamy is far more frequent, owing to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>of<br/>
providing for several wives and families at once. The wives, moreover, <span style="color: #0000FF;">arc </span>very apt to quarrel, to the utter destruction of domestic<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">peace</span>, unless the husband can afford to assign them separate houses.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Few </span>men remain unmarried. The treatment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">women </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mere </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ehattels</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is of very remote <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oriental </span>origin, constitutes the greatest<br/>
defect of the system of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-lslam</span>, although the position of the female<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sex </span>among the Oriental Christians and Jews is little better than<br/>
among the Muslims. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is probably owing to this low <span style="color: #0000FF;">estimate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
