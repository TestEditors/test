<br/>
cannot help feeling that the style fails to give entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">aesthetic<br/>
</span>satisfaction. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Want </span>of symmetry in plan, poverty of articulation,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">insufficiency </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ot'plastic</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>decoration. and an incongruous mingling of<br/>
stone and wood, are the imperfections which strike most northern<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">critics</span>. The architects, in fact, bestowed the whole of their attention<br/>
on the decoration of <span style="color: #0000FF;">surfaces</span>; and down to the present day the<br/>
Arabian artists have always displayed <span style="color: #0000FF;">far </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">greater </span>ability in <span style="color: #0000FF;">tracing<br/>
</span>elegant outlines, and designing <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>most complicated ornaments<br/>
and geometrical <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>on plane surfaces, than in the treatment<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">proportioning </span>of masses. Although we occasionally see <span style="color: #0000FF;">difti-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">culties </span>of construction well overcome, as in the case of the interior<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bib </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en-Nay</span>, these instances seem rather to be successful<br/>
experiments than the result of <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>workmanship. The real<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">excellence </span>of the Arabian architects lay in their skill in masking<br/>
abrupt angles by the use <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'stalactites</span>' or brackets.<br/>
<br/>
If we enquire into the causes of these defects in the development of art we shall find that the climate is one of the principal.<br/>
Its remarkable mildness and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rareness </span>of rain <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>enabled architects to dispense <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>much that appears essential to the inhabitant of <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>northern latitudes; and hence the imperfect <span style="color: #0000FF;">development </span>and frequent absence of cornices. The extraordinary<br/>
durability of wood in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>, again, has led to its being used in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>of walls, and in connection with stone, in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">manner </span>which would never occur to northern architects. Another<br/>
circumstance <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable </span>to the development of native art has<br/>
doubtless been the ease with which the architects obtained abundance of pillars and capitals in ancient buildings ready to their<br/>
hand. There were also political obstacles to the progress of art,<br/>
such as frequent intestine struggles and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dissensions</span>, and the<br/>
sway of despotic rulers and their <span style="color: #0000FF;">servile </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">officers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and, lastly, the<br/>
characteristic Egyptian tenacity and veneration for tradition and<br/>
religious precept have not been without their influence. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">original </span>design ofthe mosque, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">example</span>, was borrowed from Mecca.<br/>
and no deviation could <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>made from its plan; and this accounts<br/>
for the invariable recurrence of the same forms in the mosques of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>a few instances architects ventured to introduce innovations, but they <span style="color: #0000FF;">never</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">led </span>to revert sooner or later to the<br/>
established style. The external architecture of private houses,<br/>
however, being unfettered by religious considerations, might have<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">progressed </span>more <span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>but for the powerful <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">superstition </span>and fear. An external display of wealth, according to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">popular </span>notion, drew upon its possessor the'evil eye' of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">00veIONS</span>. the <span style="color: #0000FF;">consequence </span>of which was misfortune or death, while, on<br/>
the other hand, it afforded the government a pretext for extorting<br/>
heavy <span style="color: #0000FF;">tum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>from the occupant. It therefore became customary<br/>
with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span>to restrict any appearance of luxury to the<br/>
interior of their harems. where it is exhibited in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sumptuous<br/>
