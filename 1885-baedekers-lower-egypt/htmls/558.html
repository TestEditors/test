</span>emerald, which is frequently mentioned by ancient authors was a green<br/>
paste coloured with copper, which, when ground, yielded the best green<br/>
paint. This raw material was used by the Egyptians for colouring glass,<br/>
of which many pieces are preserved, and was probably the malachite which<br/>
is called by Theophrastus'false emerald', or copper green; and which,<br/>
being much used for soldering gold, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">named'chrysocolla</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>- The inscriptions always mention mafkat with <span style="color: #ff0000;">khesbet</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">AS</span>. lapis lazuli (either<br/>
genuine, inferior, or artificial), as the two minerals which are generally<br/>

small nodules by itself. In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mriidi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maghiira </span>copper was formerly<br/>
worked, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">along </span>with it was doubtless found malachite, which was<br/>

</span>obtained in it. The miners were condemned criminals, particularly<br/>
political <span style="color: #0000FF;">offenders </span>and prisoners of war. The relations also of the<br/>
prisoners were frequently condemned to the mines and compelled to<br/>
work in fetters. As, at a later period, the Christians were compelled to<br/>
work in the porphyry quarries, so in the reign of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tho<br/>
