<span>BUILDINGS OF THE MOHAMMEDANS. 179<br/>
<br/>
junction of the walls and ceiling is generally masked by a pendent<br/>
cornice, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>a cornice <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a frieze for inscriptions. The beams<br/>
used in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>ceilings are generally square at both<br/>
ends to a length of 3-5 ft., beyond which they are rounded below,<br/>
and frequently carved. The interstices between the beams are<br/>
sometimes divided into'coffers'; and proper <span style="color: #ff0000;">coifered </span>ceilings also<br/>
occur, as in the mosque <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salaheddin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tusnf </span>in the citadel <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.264</span>).<br/>
In the corners of the apartments, as well as under the principal<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">architraves</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">pendants </span>are generally placed to conceal the angles.<br/>
The earliest ceilings appear to have consisted of <span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-trunks</span>, and<br/>
then covered with <span style="color: #ff0000;">boards </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ofsycamore </span>wood, which were often richly<br/>
carved. The space immediately in front of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">kibla </span>(prayer niche)<br/>
usually terminated in a dome borne by columns. Spherical and<br/>
groined vaulting was used for smaller chambers only; but the<br/>
arcades <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Barlstsli </span>mosque (p. 282), with their depressed spherical brick vaulting, form an exception to this rule. In secular<br/>
buildings the use of vaulting is much more frequent, as in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of the city-gate <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bab </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">en</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nasr </span>(p. 230) and other arched passages. The entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-floors </span>of palaces are also sometimes<br/>
vaulted, and bridges and aqueducts were usually executed in barrel<br/>
vaulting, or with pointed arches.<br/>
<br/>
The Decorations generally consist of panelling or flat paintings,<br/>
destitute of structural meaning, while pilasters, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornices</span>, and other<br/>
architectural embellishments are <span style="color: #0000FF;">rare </span>This species of ornamentation was doubtless originally suggested by the carpets, fringes,<br/>
and mats, used by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabs </span>for covering their walls. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">stalactite<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">corbellings</span>, on the other hand, which mask the union of the vertical<br/>
with the horizontal parts of the building, and take the place of the<br/>
vaulting used in western architecture, are of a more structural<br/>
character; but even these perform no real architectural function<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>and form a <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>fantastic decoration of the angles of the domes.<br/>
<br/>
The panel and frieze decorations are either foliage, geometrical<br/>
figures, or written characters. The Foliage is usually shaped in<br/>
rectangular relief, with a few incisions to divide the broader<br/>
surfaces. The moulding is generally more or less in conformity<br/>
with the spirit of the classical style, but in the conventional<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">arabesques </span>the leaves and other parts of plants of a southern<br/>
climate are recognisable. The Geometrical Figures consist either<br/>
of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">kaleidoscopic </span>arrangement of constantly recurring fantastic<br/>
forms, or of a series of intertwined and broken lines. Lastly,<br/>
the Arabic Written Characters with which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">friezes </span>are often<br/>
decorated, and more particularly the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cutie </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Siding </span>characters,<br/>
are peculiarly well adapted for ornamental purposes, as they<br/>
resemble decorative foliage, although destitute <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>strictly symmetrical and continuous character. When the writing is employed for lengthy inscriptions in low relief, the ground on which<br/>
it is placed is generally covered with slightly raised arabesques.<br/>
