<span>50 THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. Barbers.<br/>
<br/>
part of the valley of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile</span>, who form the largest foreign element<br/>
of the community, and who never entirely assimilate with it, as the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nubians </span>make it a rule never to marry Egyptian wives. The Nubians, on the other hand, speak slightingly <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as'Wod-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">er-flif</span>', or sons of the Nile valley (<span style="color: #0000FF;">pomp</span>. p. 31). The two races<br/>
entertain a great dislike to each other, and their dispositions are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fundamentally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">different</span>. The Nubians are inferior to the Egyptians<br/>
in industry and energy, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>in tilling the soil, and also in<br/>
physical strength; and they are more <span style="color: #0000FF;">superstitious-and </span>fanatical, as<br/>
is indicated by the numerous amulets they wear round their<br/>
necks and arms. They are, however, superior to the Egyptians in<br/>
cleanliness, honesty, and subordination, and possess a more highly<br/>
developed sense of honour. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Nubian doorkeepers who are to<br/>
be found in all the mercantile houses of Alexandria and elsewhere<br/>
are noted for their honesty. The traveller must not expect to find<br/>
them very sincerely attached or grateful, any more than the native<br/>
Egyptians (comp. pp. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">?</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'35</span>), but as servants they are certainly<br/>
preferable. The inhabitants of the Nubian part of the valley of<br/>
the Nile are not all strictly Nubians; for in the southern parts<br/>
of that region a colony of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sh√©giyeh </span>and other Arabian tribes has<br/>
settled in comparatively recent times. The genuine Nubians (a<br/>
name unknown to themselves, and of ancient origin) occupy the<br/>
valley of the Nile from Gebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Barkal </span>near the fourth cataract<br/>
down to the first cataract, and are divided in accordance with the<br/>
principal idioms of their language into <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamie</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kentis</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Don</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Colo. </span>Their language belongs to the Libyan group of the N.African<br/>
tongues, and Dr. <span style="color: #ff0000;">llrugsch </span>is of <span style="color: #0000FF;">opinion </span>that it may afford a clue to<br/>
the interpretation of the still <span style="color: #0000FF;">undeciphered </span>Ethiopian (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mero'itic</span>)<br/>
inscriptions of the Nubian part of the Nile valley. Dr. Lepsius,<br/>
on the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand</span>, who has published an admirable work on the<br/>
subject, maintains that <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'to-bedyawiyeh</span>' language of the Bega<br/>
(p. 45) is more likely to be cognate with that of the inscriptions,<br/>
as he believes that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Blemmyes</span>, the ancestors of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boga</span>, were<br/>
the original inhabitants ofthe region in question, and were expelled<br/>
by the handsome and <span style="color: #0000FF;">intelligent'Nuba</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>negroes from the district to<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kordofan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Friedrich <span style="color: #ff0000;">llliiller </span>places the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nuba </span>tongue in<br/>
a separate category along with the dialects of a few other tribes in<br/>
different parts of Africa, and there is certainly much to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>said in<br/>
favour of this distinction of it from the languages of the Hamitic<br/>
races on the one side and the typical negro races on the other.<br/>
Those <span style="color: #0000FF;">Berbers </span>who do not learn Arabic grammatically never speak<br/>
it thoroughly well; but itis generally, <span style="color: #0000FF;">though </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">imperfectly</span>, understood<br/>
in Nubia. The traveller must <span style="color: #ff0000;">thereforenot </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">expect </span>to learn good <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabic<br/>
</span>from his Nubian servants. In their native country they till the banks<br/>
of the Nile, but their land is of very limited extent and poorly <span style="color: #0000FF;">cultivated</span>; and as their harvests are scanty they are rarely able to support<br/>
large <span style="color: #0000FF;">familie </span>They accordingly often emigrate at an early age to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
