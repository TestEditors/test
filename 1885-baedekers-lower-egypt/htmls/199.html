</span>These <span style="color: #ff0000;">excrescenees </span>might be regarded as external prolongations o.<br/>
the pendentives of the interior, but do not correspond with them <span style="color: #0000FF;">if<br/>
</span>position. The architects, however, doubtless intended to suggest<br/>
some such connection between the internal and external ornamentation. The domes are constructed partly of stone and partly<br/>
of brick, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pendants </span>being of stone, or of plaster and lath-work,<br/>
and they are sometimes of considerable length. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>are<br/>
probably those of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khalifs</span>' Tombs. The greatly elongated domes<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>tombs have a second dome structure in their interior. The latter, lying much lower, supports walls placed in a<br/>
radiating form, which bear the upper dome. One of these dilapidated tombs (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">327</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>affords a good opportunity of examining this<br/>
mode of construction. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Neat </span>it there is also a dome with <span style="color: #ff0000;">alauteru</span>, a<br/>
form quite foreign to the customary style of Arabian dome building.<br/>
<br/>
It is a mistake to suppose that the joints are not cut in a straight<br/>
direction, but were formed in curved or broken lines which required each stone to be an exact counterpart of its neighbour.<br/>
This arrangement is occasionally seen in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of straight or<br/>
flat segment-shaped plinths, but even there this kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">construction </span>is often merely simulated by means of inlaid marble of<br/>
different <span style="color: #0000FF;">colon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Minarets </span>[ from the Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">mcnd'reh</span>,'a signal' <span style="color: #ff0000;">or'signalpost</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>) are generally square at the base, tapering upwards, story by<br/>
story, until the form at length changes to that of an octagon or<br/>
cylinder. On these towers <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">architects </span>have expended their utmost<br/>
skill, and the spectator will not fail to be struck by their graceful<br/>
proportions. The highest story is sometimes formed of pilasters,<br/>
or columns, which <span style="color: #ff0000;">bear </span>a roof, either consisting of one or more<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dome</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shaped </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">protuberances </span>with the symbol of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Islam</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">ora<br/>
</span>simple conical point. They are generally built of substantial masonry, and contain Winding Staircases of stone leading to the<br/>
galleries of the different stories and to the balconies between them.<br/>
From these last the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mueddins </span>summon the faithful to prayer<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">147</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>galleries are borne by projecting <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornices</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the<br/>
balconies by brackets of similar construction. The wooden rods<br/>
and hooks at the top of the minarets are used for hanging up the<br/>
lamps during the fasting month of Ramadan. The mosques were<br/>
also formerly provided with external platforms <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>called <span style="color: #0000FF;">meek-horas</span>),<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>incense used to be burned on high festivals, so as to<br/>
diffuse sweet perfumes throughout the whole neighbourhood. The<br/>
mosque <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Hakim </span>is now the only one which still possesses<br/>
platforms of this kind.<br/>
