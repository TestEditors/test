represented by <span style="color: #0000FF;">consuls</span>, that mixed tribunals should be appointed, consisting of courts of first and second instance, for the trial of all civil cases<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">arising </span>between natives and foreigners, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>foreigners of <span style="color: #0000FF;">different<br/>
</span>nationalities, in accordance with Egyptian law, founded on that of<br/>
France and Italy. Cases in which the Khedive himself and the Egyptian<br/>
government are concerned are also tried before this new tribunal, so<br/>
that the system of appeals, formerly so much abused, is now done away<br/>
with. The courts of the first instance are at Alexandria and Cairo.<br/>
The judges consist of natives and foreigners, the latter being elected by<br/>
the Khedive out of the qualified officials nominated by the Great Powers.<br/>
The-appeal court at Alexandria is constituted in the same manner.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Somewa </span>the judges of the first instance are also chosen from members<br/>
of the smaller European states. These courts enjoy a constitutional<br/>
guarantee for the independence of their jurisdiction, and, so far as<br/>
necessary, they execute their judgments by means of their own officers.<br/>
The languages used are Arabic, French, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Italian </span>From 1881 to <span style="color: #ff0000;">1834<br/>
</span>the jurisdiction of these mixed tribunals was prolonged by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">consent<br/>
</span>of the Powers from year to year, and at the beginning of the latter year<br/>
it was agreed to continue it for another period of five <span style="color: #0000FF;">years</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>Besides<br/>
these new courts, the consular and local tribunals <span style="color: #0000FF;">still </span>continue to subsist, their jurisdiction being, however, limited to criminal cases and<br/>
to civil suits between foreigners of the same nationality, provided the<br/>
question does not <span style="color: #0000FF;">affect </span>land.<br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1881 </span>there was called into existence <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>new system of Native <span style="color: #0000FF;">Courts</span>, which take precedence of the mixed courts in deciding criminal cases between natives and foreigners. The general procedure is based on the Code Napoleon. Courts of the first instance have<br/>
been, or are to be erected at Cairo, Alexandria<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tania</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zalgfizilg</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bertha</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">neni </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shat</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sim</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kene</span>, while the courts of appeal are at Cairo and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span>. With the native judges are associated ten Belgians, two Dutchmen, and one <span style="color: #0000FF;">Englishman</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>A scheme is, however, on foot to appoint a<br/>
commission to extend to the mixed tribunals the <span style="color: #ff0000;">criminaljurisdiction </span>in<br/>
cases where different nationalities are engaged.<br/>

<br/>
Alexandria, the chief seaport of Egypt, is regularly visited by<br/>
English, French, Austrian, Italian, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Russian</span>, Greek, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Egyptian<br/>
steamers. Whether the traveller returns westwards on leaving<br/>
Egypt, or intends to proceed to Syria or elsewhere, it is important<br/>
that he should be familiar with the principal steamboat services.<br/>

<br/>
In selecting a route the traveller must of course be guided by<br/>
circumstances and his own inclination. The shortest sea-voyage is<br/>
that from Brindisi, three days and a half; from Trieste (<span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span>Corfu),<br/>
or from Venice (<span style="color: #ff0000;">via </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ancona </span>and Brindisi), five days; from Naples,<br/>
four days. The last-named route is perhaps the best for returning<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>as<br/>
