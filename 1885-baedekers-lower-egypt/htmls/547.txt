who captured it in 1170, and the Franks, who were afterwards unable to<br/>
maintain possession of it, notwithstanding the efforts made by Count<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">liainold</span>. After the Crusades the history of the peninsula was merged in<br/>
that of Egypt. Its sequestered valleys were traversed by hosts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mecca<br/>
</span>pilgrims, while there was also, as at the present day, no lack of<br/>
Christian pilgrims of the Greek faith, wending their way to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monastery </span>of Sinai.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Exonus</span>. Until recently the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bible </span>was the only source of information regarding the emigration of the Jews from Egypt, but the monuments and <span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-scrolls </span>which have been handed down to us by the<br/>
ancient Egyptians, and deciphered by modern ingenuity, now <span style="color: #0000FF;">convey </span>to<br/>
us a distinct idea of the condition of Egypt at the time of the Exodus,<br/>
which we may compare with the contemporaneous Biblical accounts. On<br/>
collating the Bible narrative with the monuments, we find that they<br/>
agree on all material points. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the other hand, however, it seems<br/>
obvious, that the vicissitudes undergone by the Israelites in Egypt and<br/>
during the Exodus, must have been gradually embellished by legendary<br/>
and poetical additions, before they were recorded in writing. These<br/>
embellishments doubtless originated in the fertile imagination <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>people,<br/>
and in their profound gratitude, which prompted them to paint in the<br/>
most glowing and picturesque colours the great things which God had<br/>
done for them, Most of the camping-places of the people seem, as we<br/>
shall see, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>capable of identification, since the list <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stations </span>in the<br/>
wilderness, as given by Moses (Numb<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>xxxiii), was doubtless made from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">contemporaneous </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">recordsf..<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Period of the Oppression. After Joseph's death the Israelites had<br/>
multiplied greatly, and, together with other Semitic tribes, occupied the<br/>
whole of the NE. part of the Delta, whilst the early Pharaohs of the<br/>
19th Dynasty were constantly at war with the nations whose territory<br/>
adjoined the Delta on the NE. It was therefore natural that the Egyptian kings should fear that, during their absence and that of the Egyptian army, the Jews should ally themselves with the enemies of Egypt, who<br/>
were of cognate race, and this apprehension is distinctly mentioned by<br/>
Pharaoh in the Bible narrative. Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">11.</span>, after whom one of the scenes<br/>
of the compulsory labour of the Israelites was named, was the Pharaoh<br/>
of the oppression, and his son <span style="color: #ff0000;">illerenptah </span>(the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menephthes </span>of Manetho) was<br/>
the Pharaoh of the Exodus. The monuments inform us, that these<br/>
two monarchs decorated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tania</span>, the ancient city of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos</span>, anew with<br/>
magnificent monuments, the place having long been shunned by their<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span>The following theory regarding the Exodus, which was started during<br/>
last century by G. <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>Richter, and maintained more recently by Schleiden,<br/>
has again been adopted <span style="color: #ff0000;">byBrugsch </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">0017113.</span>, however, the observation at p.470).<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'According </span>to the monuments, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sethroitic </span>name was also called<br/>
Suku <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Succoth. This region was covered with marshes, lakes, and canals, so that it was impossible to erect towns in the Interior of the<br/>
district, and accordingly the Egyptian texts, as well as the classic <span style="color: #0000FF;">authors</span>, mention towns on its boundaries only. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>three following are<br/>
those <span style="color: #ff0000;">oftencst </span>mentioned. One named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ifhetam </span>(i.e. fortress) of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Succoth<br/>
</span>lay to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N</span>, near Pelusium<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and was intended to protect the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">frontier</span>. A second, bearing the Semitic name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">59901.</span>, or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sager </span>(i.e. key),<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Succoth, and situated on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span>. frontier of the district, was intended<br/>
to protect the district of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tanis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Â« </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramses </span>against invasion. The third,<br/>
known by the Semitic name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Migdol </span>(i.e. tower), or by the Egyptian<br/>
name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Samul </span>(also signifying a tower), lay on the outskirts of the<br/>
Arabian desert, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the E. frontier of the district of Succoth, the site<br/>
being probably identical with that of the modern Tell <span style="color: #0000FF;">es-Samat </span>(see<br/>
Map of the Suez Canal to the E. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kantara</span>). <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brngsch </span>identifies the Biblical <span style="color: #0000FF;">Smooth </span>with Segol in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Succoth</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Migdol </span>with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">above-mentioned<br/>
</span>Migdol-Samut. The Biblical Etham, however, which is wanting to complete the list of the stations, is also capable of identification, for it<br/>
can be no other than the Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">thtam</span>, which signifies fortress, the<br/>
same word being preserved also in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khetam </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Succoth </span>(see <span style="color: #ff0000;">eheveh<br/>
