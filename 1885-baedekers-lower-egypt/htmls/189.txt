<br/>
not merely with the different modes of building and their details,<br/>
but with the peculiarities of the national religious rites. The costly<br/>
stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>of the ancient Egyptians were used exclusively for<br/>
religious purposes. It is an error to suppose that the temples contained the royal residences within their precincts; the nature of the<br/>
climate alone would have rendered them uninhabitable. The kings'<br/>
palaces, as we learn from the representations <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthem </span>in tombs, were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>of a very light and airy description, adorned with balconies,<br/>
colonnades, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bowers</span>, and surrounded by gardens and ponds.<br/>
They were built of brick and wood, and, as the sole object of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>architects was to provide a convenient and pleasant dwelling, they<br/>
were richly decorated with colouring.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>regard to the architecture of the temples, it is important<br/>
to keep in view the <span style="color: #0000FF;">factY </span>that they were neither destined for the<br/>
reception of a congregation like Christian churches, nor, like the<br/>
Greek temples, erected as mere receptacles for the image of the god.<br/>
The Egyptian worshippers approached the temple precincts in<br/>
solemn procession, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>profane remained outside, while the initiated and the ordained penetrated to different parts of the interior<br/>
in accordance with the degree of their knowledge of the divine<br/>
mysteries, the high priest alone being privileged to enter the<br/>
innermost sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
The multitude would first arrive in their festively decorated<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">boats </span>by the great highway of the Nile, and they would then traverse<br/>
the avenue leading to the temple, which was <span style="color: #0000FF;">flanked </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">sphinxes<br/>
</span>on each side<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The sphinxes consist of a lion's body with the<br/>
head of a man (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Androsphinxj</span>, or that of a ram (<span style="color: #ff0000;">kriosphinsj</span>, and<br/>
according to an inscription at Edfu they were intended to symbolise the <span style="color: #0000FF;">conflict </span>of Horus with Typhon-Seth. The sphinx avenue<br/>
led to the precincts of the temple proper, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Temenos </span>of the<br/>
Greeks, which were completely enclosed by a wall, built of bricks<br/>
of the Nile clay, or, as at Edfu, of solid stone. The sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">lakes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>generally two in number, and the sacred grove were usually the only<br/>
accessories of the temple which lay without the precincts. At the<br/>
end of the avenue the eye is confronted by two huge towers with the<br/>
entrance between them, called the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pylons</span>, which are in the form of<br/>
truncated pyramids, with walls divided into sections by round<br/>
staves, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ml'ording </span>admirable surfaces for plastic or pictorial decoration. The pylons and the portal between them are both crowned<br/>
with the usual hollowed cornice. Under ordinary circumstances<br/>
these pylons present a very imposing appearance, but their<br/>
grandeur must have been much enhanced <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>they were festively<br/>
decorated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Las </span>in Fig. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>on solemn occasions, and when gaily hung<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>flags to welcome the arrival of the worshippers. Within the<br/>
pylons, in the larger temples, lay a large open court (Peristyle),<br/>
flanked on two or three sides with colonnades, and beyond it a<br/>
large <span style="color: #ff0000;">ball </span>borne by columns (Hypostyle), of which those in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
