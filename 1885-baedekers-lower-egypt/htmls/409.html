</span>the'great' or'considerable', was erected by Khafra, who was called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Chephren </span>by the Greeks, and whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">portrait-statue </span>is preserved in<br/>
the museum at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Billet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">305</span>), but his name has not been discovered on any part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">structure </span>Owing to the greater height<br/>
of the rocky plateau on which it stands, it appears higher than its<br/>
larger neighbour. As the rocky site rises towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>and N.,<br/>
a considerable part of it required to be removed in order that a level<br/>
surface might be obtained. The levelled space surrounding the base<br/>
of the Pyramid was paved with blocks of limestone <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see p. 369).<br/>
To the E. are remains of the temple erected for the worshippers<br/>
of the deceased Pharaoh, a structure of the kind which probably<br/>
adjoined all large pyramids <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>368). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">incrustation </span>of the<br/>
Pyramid, which must have been preserved down to the middle of<br/>
the 17th cent, seems to have been laid on in a rough condition and<br/>
to have been polished afterwards, beginning <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>top. The lower<br/>
courses were left in the rough, a circumstance which led the French<br/>
savants to suppose that the Pyramid was once surrounded by a<br/>
pedestal. The merit of having opened this Pyramid belongs almost<br/>
exclusively to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Balsam</span>, a most enterprising and successful <span style="color: #ff0000;">explorer'r</span>.<br/>
An inscription over the entrance records that the opening <span style="color: #0000FF;">took<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">plane </span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">March </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2nd</span>, 1818.<br/>
<br/>
The Interior is entered by two passages on the N. side. The mouth of<br/>
one <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>these is in the level surface in front of the Pyramid, and was <span style="color: #0000FF;">concealed </span>by the pavement; that of the other is on the N. side of the Pyramid<br/>
itself, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>formerly <span style="color: #ff0000;">49 </span>ft. above the level of the ground. This<br/>
upper passage, which was lined with granite at the beginning, descends at<br/>
an angle <span style="color: #0000FF;">11 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">23'55</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>to a depth of 105 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft.. </span>leading first to a horizontal <span style="color: #0000FF;">corridor</span>, and thence to<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>'<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>which once <span style="color: #0000FF;">contained </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb<br/>

frequently, and in connection with discoveries of such importance, that<br/>
a brief notice of his remarkable career may not be unacceptable. He<br/>
was the son of a poor barber, and was born at Padua in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1778. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lie </span>was<br/>
brought up as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>monk at <span style="color: #0000FF;">home</span>, where he was distinguished <span style="color: #0000FF;">both </span>for<br/>
mental and physical endowments, and devoted much of his time to drawing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Rome </span>was occupied by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">French</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>he <span style="color: #0000FF;">quilted </span>that city and<br/>
went to England, and while in London eked out his livelihood by <span style="color: #0000FF;">eating<br/>
</span>as a model for figures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hercules </span>and Apollo. At the same time he<br/>
devoted <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerable </span>time to study, and especially to the science of<br/>
water-engineering. Accompanied by his high-spirited wife, he next went<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">gym</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>he arrived in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1815 </span>and was at first obliged to support<br/>
himself by <span style="color: #0000FF;">dancing </span>in public. He at length attracted the attention of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed'Ali</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>who accorded him relief. His first undertaking of importance was the opening of the Pyramid of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chephren</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>next discovered the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1. </span>at Thebes (No. 17), the finest of all the royal<br/>
tombs; he opened the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-temples </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Simbel</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">re-discovered </span>the<br/>
emerald mines of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tab</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and the ruins of the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">Here</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>on the<br/>
Red Sea. He died in 1823 while on <span style="color: #ff0000;">ajonrncy </span>into the interior of Africa.<br/>
A giant in stature. he inspired the Arabs with such admiration that he<br/>
could prevail upon them to undertake the most unusual tasks. At the<br/>
same time he was an intelligent explorer, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">very </span>able and accurate<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">draughtsman</span>. His works, partly published by himself, and partly by <span style="color: #0000FF;">his<br/>
</span>widow, are still valuable<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
