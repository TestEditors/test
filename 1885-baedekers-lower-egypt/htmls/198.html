<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">176 </span>BUILDINGS <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">DIUIIAMHEDA<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">niehe </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mosques </span>rises nearly to the full height of the facade.<br/>
and terminates at the top either in asphere, or in a polygonal halfdome, partly ribbed, and partly embellished with pendentives or<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'stalactites</span>'. The two perpendicular mural pillars of the niche<br/>
approach each other towards the top, either in curved or in straight<br/>
lines converging at an acute angle. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>neither <span style="color: #ff0000;">case</span>, however, do they<br/>
actually meet, the niche terminating above in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hemispherical </span>dome,<br/>
which springs from the converging <span style="color: #0000FF;">lines</span>. The form of the entrance<br/>
varies considerably<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span>some cases it terminates above in an architrave, in others in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">round </span>or pointed arch, while fantastically<br/>
waxed or broken-arch forms are also not uncommon. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">commonest<br/>
</span>style in the mosques is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">arehitrave </span>form with segmental relieving<br/>
arches. A favourite practice was to pave the threshold with an <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>block of red or black granite, even if covered with hieroglyphics, and in many cases these venerable inscriptions are still<br/>
traceable. In the mosques, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">resting-place </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">front </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>door,<br/>
is a low <span style="color: #ff0000;">railing </span>which marks the boundary to which the visitor may<br/>
penetrate without removing his shoes or <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandals </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Windows </span>are more commonly rectangular than arched,<br/>
and are sometimes grouped in twos and threes, in which case they<br/>
are often tastefully adorned with round, oval, or star-shaped <span style="color: #0000FF;">rosettes </span>in plaster, perforated, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with coloured glass. This<br/>
arrangement has many points of resemblance to the Byzantine<br/>
and Romanesque styles. The window in the facades are frequently<br/>
surrounded with scrolls in low relief, and with flat bands or <span style="color: #ff0000;">rollmouldings </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0n </span>the inside they are usually adorned with friezes in<br/>
plaster with arabesques.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Special </span>importance was attached to the principal doors of <span style="color: #ff0000;">mounmeutal </span>buildings, which as a rule were massively mounted with<br/>
iron or bronze, or were constructed of pieces of wood of different<br/>
colours, ingeniously fitted together. The portals of some of the<br/>
mosques are embellished with bronze decorations, beautifully<br/>
embossed and chased. The doors in the interior of the buildings<br/>
are often richly inlaid with ebony and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ivory<br/>
<br/>
</span>The home, a very salient feature in Mohammedan buildings,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>in the mosques and <span style="color: #ff0000;">mansolea</span>, varies much in form;<br/>
the base of the structure projects beyond the square <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-plan </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, and the summit rises above the enclosing wall.<br/>
The dome, which tapers upwards in an elliptical form and is<br/>
adorned with knobs and <span style="color: #0000FF;">crescents</span>, is blended with the quadrangular<br/>
interior of the mausoleum by means of pendentives; while, <span style="color: #0000FF;">estt </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rually</span>, the union of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cube </span>with the sphere is somewhat masked<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">polwoual </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">base </span>of the dome. in some cases the transition is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cftcetwl </span>by 1 <span style="color: #0000FF;">loans </span>of gradations resembling steps, each of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
