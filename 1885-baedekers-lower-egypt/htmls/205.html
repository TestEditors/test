</span>furniture and hangings, and in the jewellery ofthe women. These<br/>
indications of wealth are never seen except by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">proprietor's<br/>
</span>nearest relations and the female friends of his wives, and are<br/>
effectually concealed from the view of the government and of the<br/>
general public.<br/>

With regard to Sculpture and Painting it will strike the traveller that the modern Egyptian chisel and brush have been reserved exclusively for the decoration of wall surfaces. Representations<br/>
of animals occur rarely, while those of the human figure were<br/>
prohibited by the Koran (<span style="color: #0000FF;">camp</span>. p. 218). The latter, however, are<br/>
occasionally met with. One of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulnnides</span>, for example, caused<br/>
a festal hall to be adorned with painted wooden statues of himself,<br/>
his wives, and his favourite dancers; and at Cairo there was<br/>
even a famous manufactory of figures of men and animals at that<br/>
period. In the 11th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>, as we are informed, there were two celebrated painters at Cairo who vied with each other in the execution of relief pictures. One of them painted a dancer, who seemed<br/>
to be disappearing into the wall, while his rival painted another<br/>
who seemed to be coming out from it. El-Kitami's picture of<br/>
Joseph in the pit was also a far-famed work. On the whole, however, these branches of art were but little developed, the Egyptians resembling the Israelites in this respect. The Arabs were<br/>
more successful, however, in the prosecution of artistic handicrafts,<br/>
and excelled in the embellishment of all kinds of implements in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">metal-work</span>, enamel, inlaying, engraving, etc. Their decorative<br/>
ingenuity, developed by these arts quite as much as by the wall<br/>
decorations, and applied to textile fabrics also, has attained so<br/>
wide a celebrity, that the word'Arabesque' is now nearly synonymous with'ornament'. The word'Grotesque' was once similarly<br/>
applied to the western style of decoration borrowed by Raphael<br/>
and Giovanni da Udine from the'Grottoes' of the Baths of Titus at<br/>
Rome, and employed by them with singular success in the loggie<br/>
of the Vatican, but this word has long since lost its original<br/>
meaning.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosques are divided, in accordance with their religious<br/>
importance, into two kinds: <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>) those in which the sermon<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">khutbeh</span>) is preached on Fridays, called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Game</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'2</span>) those in which<br/>
prayer only is offered daily except on Fridays, named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jfespidr</span>,<br/>
or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ztftviya</span>. The name <span style="color: #ff0000;">mesgid</span>, which has been imported from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Constantinople</span>, is less frequently used than <span style="color: #0000FF;">zawiya</span>, which denotes a small mosque, consisting of one chamber only.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>It is from this word <span style="color: #ff0000;">mesgid </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>which means a place for prostration),<br/>
that we derive the word mosque, through the Spanish mezquita and the<br/>
French mosqu√©e<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
