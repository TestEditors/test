<span>508 Route 10. MONASTERY 0F SINAI. <span style="color: #0000FF;">F-rom </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Suez<br/>
<br/>
</span>Among the sacred utensils in the choir are a finely executed<br/>
Ciborium, or stand for the communion chalice, and a short marble<br/>
sarcophagus said to contain the head and one hand <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofSL </span>Catharine,<br/>
who is specially revered by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Creek </span>orthodox church. Here, too,<br/>
is shown a valuable, but unpleasing <span style="color: #0000FF;">reliquary</span>, presented by Russian Christians. The head of St. Catharine is represented on a<br/>
silver pillow<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>her face and hands being enamelled. Another similar<br/>
reliquary, bearing a figure of the saint in gilded silver, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">presented </span>by the Empress Catharine of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Russia<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Chapel of the Burning Bush, <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the back of the apse,<br/>
marking the spot where God is said to have appeared to Moses, is<br/>
probably the oldest part of the structure. Visitors must remove<br/>
their shoes before entering. The walls are covered with slabs of<br/>
porcelain. The spot where the bush is said to have stood is<br/>
indicated by a plate of chased silver; over it is placed a kind of<br/>
altar, <span style="color: #0000FF;">within </span>Which are suspended three burning lamps. At the<br/>
back of this sanctuary is a small niche adorned with figures, in a<br/>
line with the apse, the semicircular wall of which encloses the<br/>
whole E. end of the building. A ray of the sun is said to enter<br/>
this sanctuary once only in the course of the year, gaining admission<br/>
through a cleft of the rock on the E. side of the valley. From a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cross </span>erected there the hill has been named the Jebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">es</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Salib</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The Chapels surrounding the nave contain no objects of interest.<br/>
Each is dedicated to an evangelist, saint, or martyr (SS. Anna, the<br/>
holy martyrs of Sinai, James, Constantia and Helena, Demetrius<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sergius</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>. Adjoining the right aisle of the basilica are the<br/>
chapels of SS. Simon Stylites, Cosmas, and Damianus; adjoining<br/>
the left aisle are those of SS. Anna, Marina, and Antipas. The<br/>
chapel for the Latins, near the visitors' rooms, is now disused, as<br/>
the Roman Catholics no longer make pilgrimages to this monastery.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosque, a building of simple construction, is badly preserved. The stone wall of an out-building near the mosque and an<br/>
arch between the mosque and the church still hear several coats of<br/>
arms in the early <span style="color: #0000FF;">mediaeval </span>style, perhaps those of Crusaders. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Opposite </span>is the chapel of the Panagia, which contains several portraits of bishops and archbishops of Sinai and a large model of a<br/>
projected reconstruction of the monastery. It is now, however, very<br/>
problematical whether this scheme of reconstruction will ever be<br/>
carried out, since the property of the convent in Russia and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Walachia </span>has been secularised.<br/>
<br/>
The Library of the monastery, which is sadly cramped for want<br/>
of room, is more valuable than many better arranged and outwardly<br/>
more imposing collections in Europe. Among its treasures are a<br/>
great many Greek and Arabic MSS., besides others in Syrian,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethiopian</span>, Persian, Armenian, Slavonic, and Russian. The most<br/>
valuable MSS., however, are kept stored away in cases, and the<br/>
only ones exhibited to visitors are a few'show' pieces in <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
