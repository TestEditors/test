<span>ARABIC <span style="color: #0000FF;">LANGUAGE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ISO<br/>
<br/>
</span>The language of the peasantry and the inhabitants of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert </span>is purer and more akin to the classical language than that of<br/>
the dwellers in towns. The Muslims generally speak more correctly<br/>
than the Christians, being <span style="color: #ff0000;">aerustomed </span>to a refined diction and<br/>
pronunciation from their daily <span style="color: #0000FF;">repetition </span>of passages of the Koran.<br/>
The chief difference between the language of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Korin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mid </span>the<br/>
modern colloquial dialect is that a number of terminal <span style="color: #ff0000;">intlexions<br/>
</span>are <span style="color: #ff0000;">drOpped </span>in the latter.<br/>
<br/>
Alphabet. The Arabic alphabet was developed from that of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Nabatzl'ans</span>, who in turn adopted their written characters from the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Palmyreues</span>. In spite of its external attractions, it is one of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>most imperfect in existence. In written or printed Arabic the<br/>
short vowels are usually omitted and have to be supplied by the<br/>
reader, a feat which demands <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerable </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">skill </span>and experience. In<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran</span>, however, the vowels are all indicated by appropriate<br/>
signs. It is greatly to be wished that the Arabs would adopt a<br/>
simpler alphabet, with a regular use of the vowel-signs, and that<br/>
they would agree to write the ordinary spoken language. The present condition of affairs not only seriously increases a stranger's <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties </span>in learning the language, but is a serious obstacle to the<br/>
education of the Arabs themselves.<br/>
<br/>
We give below the sounds corresponding to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>letters,<br/>
so far as it is possible to represent or describe them to the English<br/>
reader. It should also be observed that in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">following </span>pages we<br/>
use the vowel sounds of a, c, i, o, u as they are used in Italian (ah,<br/>
eh, <span style="color: #0000FF;">00,0,001 </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>used in the Handbook is a contracted form of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ti</span>,<br/>
and is used in preference to it, as it <span style="color: #0000FF;">exactly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">represents </span>the ordinary<br/>
pronunciation (viz. that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>in fate). The original <span style="color: #0000FF;">diphthong<br/>
</span>sound of at is only used in the reading of the Koran and in a few<br/>
isolated <span style="color: #ff0000;">distritts</span>. Where a sound resembling the French <span style="color: #0000FF;">u </span>occurs<br/>
it is represented by <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>(as in <span style="color: #0000FF;">t1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iinj</span>. This system of transliteration<br/>
will be found most convenient, as the words will then generally<br/>
resemble the forms used in German, French, and Italian, instead<br/>
of being distorted to suit the English pronunciation. Thus: <span style="color: #0000FF;">cmfr</span>,<br/>
which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronounced </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Uymeer</span>'; <span style="color: #ff0000;">sldikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cor </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sheikhl</span>, pronounced<br/>
'shake' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>with a guttural k); <span style="color: #ff0000;">tulfll</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">pronounced'toolool</span>'; Abusir,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">pronounced'Abooseer</span>'; <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">VOWELS</span>. The short vowel symbols, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Frrtlzath</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cm-rah</span>, and Dummeh (<span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">if</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">if</span>), which are generally omitted, become long when <span style="color: #0000FF;">connected </span>with Alef, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Watt</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ye </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>, E, <span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>, 6, <span style="color: #0000FF;">17</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span>, an).<br/>
<br/>
The numerous gutturals <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofArabic </span>render the language <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpleasing </span>to the ear. The consonants Nos. 15, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hi</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and'21</span>, which are<br/>
sometimes <span style="color: #0000FF;">called'emphatic</span>', are very peculiar, and modify the<br/>
vowels connected with them<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>thus after them a and u approach the<br/>
sound of o, and i that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">c. </span>The sounds of the French u and <span style="color: #0000FF;">all<br/>
</span>[ German <span style="color: #ff0000;">ii </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">6</span>) are rare in colloquial Arabic<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
