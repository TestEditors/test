the pilgrims <span style="color: #ff0000;">now </span>perform <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>greater part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">distance </span>by water.<br/>
On approaching Mecca the pilgrims undress, laying aside even<br/>
their headgear, and put on aprons and a piece of cloth over the<br/>
left shoulder. They then perform the circuit of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kala</span>, kiss<br/>
the black stone, hear the sermon on Mt<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Arafat </span>near Mecca, pelt<br/>
Satan with stones in the valley of Mina, and conclude their pilgrimage with a great <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>feast. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the day when this takes<br/>
place at Mecca, sheep are slaughtered and a festival called the Great<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Beiram </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">cl-'2d </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-kebir</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">observed </span>throughout the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedan </span>countries. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>The'Lesser <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beiram</span>', Arab. <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-nd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">er-.stWtappir</span>,<br/>

year. For an account of the feast in connection with the pilgrimage see p. 236. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>order approximately to convert a year of our<br/>
era into one of the Muslim era, subtract <span style="color: #0000FF;">622</span>, divide the remainder<br/>
by 33, and add the quotient to the dividend. Conversely, a year<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammedan </span>era is converted into one of the Christian era<br/>
by dividing it by 33, subtracting the quotient from it, and adding<br/>
622 to the remainder. On <span style="color: #0000FF;">let </span>October, 1884, began the Muslim<br/>
year 1302. The Gregorian calendar has recently been introduced<br/>
into Egypt, but is used by government in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance </span>department<br/>

<br/>
Most of the Arabic LITERATURE is connected with the Koran.<br/>
Commentaries were written at an early period to explain the obscure passages in it, and there gradually sprang up a series of exegetical writings dwelling with elaborate <span style="color: #ff0000;">minuteuess </span>upon every<br/>
possible shade of interpretation. Grammar, too, was at first studied<br/>
solely in connection with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">1501511</span>, and a prodigious mass of<br/>
legal literature was founded exclusively upon the sacred volume.<br/>
Of late years, however, some attempts have been made to supersede the ancient law, and to introduce a modern European system.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>still have their peculiar customary law.<br/>
<br/>
With regard to theological, legal, and still more to ritualistic<br/>
questions, El-Islam has not always been free from <span style="color: #0000FF;">dissension</span>. There<br/>
are in the first place four Orthodox <span style="color: #ff0000;">sects</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hanefites</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shafe'ites</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Matching</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hambalites</span>, who are named after their<br/>
respective founders. In addition to these must be mentioned the<br/>
schools of Free Thinkers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>sprang up at an early period, partly<br/>
owing to the influence of Greek philosophy. The orthodox party,<br/>
however, triumphed, not only over these heretics, but also in its<br/>
struggle against the voluptuousness and luxury of the most glorious<br/>
period of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">khalifs</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ascetism </span>and fanaticism were also largely developed among<br/>
professors of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Mia</span>, and another phase of religious thought was<br/>
pure <span style="color: #0000FF;">MYSTICISM</span>, which arose <span style="color: #ff0000;">chieflyin </span>Persia. The mystics (<span style="color: #0000FF;">till</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?</span>) interpret many texts of the Koran allegorically, and their system <span style="color: #0000FF;">there<br/>
