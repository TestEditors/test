and the few scholars of any eminence who had remained till then<br/>
were obliged to leave the place. A new insurrection which broke<br/>
out in the reign of Phocas was attended with greater success than<br/>
previous revolts, for Heraclius, whom the Alexandrians now proclaimed emperor, contrived in 610 to maintain his possession of<br/>
the purple. The sway of the Eastern emperors in Egypt, however,<br/>
soon came to an end. <span style="color: #ff0000;">In </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">619 </span>Alexandria was captured by Chosroes,<br/>
King of Persia, but the Christians were left unmolested. Ten years<br/>
later <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ileraclius </span>succeeded in recovering possession of Egypt, but<br/>
the troops of the Khalif'Omar soon afterwards invaded the country<br/>
and took Alexandria after a prolonged siege. In December, <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">MI</span>,<br/>
Amr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ibu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-UP</span>, rOmar's general, entered the city; but by order<br/>
of his master, he treated the inhabitants with moderation. The<br/>
decline of Alexandria now became still more marked, and about<br/>
this period'Amr founded <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fostat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>241), as a new capital and seat<br/>
of government, free from Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences</span>. The new town,<br/>
which gradually developed itself into the modern Cairo, soon<br/>
became an important and prosperous place at the expense of the<br/>
famous ancient Greek city. During the middle ages Alexandria<br/>
sank into <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificance</span>. Its commerce received a deathblow by<br/>
the discovery of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-route </span>to India round the Cape of Good<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hope</span>, and the discovery <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofAmerica </span>entailed new losses. After the<br/>
conquest of Egypt by the Turks <span style="color: #0000FF;">6111517</span>) the city languished under<br/>
the infamous regime of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamelukes</span>, the harbours became choked<br/>
with sand, the population, which had once numbered <span style="color: #0000FF;">half </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>million<br/>
souls, dwindled down to 5000, and the environs were converted<br/>
into a sterile and marshy wilderness. With regard to the history of<br/>
the French invasion, see p. 105.<br/>
<br/>
The decay of the once powerful seaport was at length effectually<br/>
arrested by the vigorous hand of Mohammed'Ali, who improved<br/>
the harbours and constructed several canals. The chief benefit he<br/>
conferred on Alexandria was the construction of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lllallmddiych<br/>
</span>Canal, which was so named after the reigning Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahmud</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">By </span>means of this channel fresh water was conducted to the town<br/>
from the Rosetta branch of the Nile, the adjoining fields were irrigated anew, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>was again connected with the Nile and<br/>
the rest of Egypt, the products of which had long found their only<br/>
outlets through the Rosetta and Damietta mouths of the river. The<br/>
enterprising pasha began the work in 1819, employing no fewer<br/>
than <span style="color: #0000FF;">250,000 </span>labourers, and completed it at a cost of 71/2 million<br/>
francs. He also improved the whole canal-system of the Delta, the<br/>
works being chiefly superintended by the aged <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>eminent Linant<br/>
de <span style="color: #0000FF;">Belleville-Pasha</span>, general director of public works, and other<br/>
French engineers. The subsequent <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroys </span>have also made great<br/>
efforts to improve the prospects of the town; and the Egyptian<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cotton</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">trade</span>, which received a strong impulse from the American<br/>
war. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">found </span>its chief outlet through Alexandria, has proved <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
