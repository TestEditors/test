<br/>
</span>bound the gorge. Lepsius has proved that the laborious task of<br/>
making this path was first undertaken by the Christian monks.<br/>
The torrents in this rocky gorge in winter are often so violent as<br/>
to carry everything before them. In 1867 they were swelled to such<br/>
a height, that they washed away a camp of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Serif</span>, causing a loss of 40 lives and of numerous cattle, in the<br/>
midst of the arid desert. The last part of the ascent is less <span style="color: #0000FF;">precipitous</span>, and we now observe a few traces of vegetation. The rocks<br/>
here also bear some Sinaitic <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>At the upper end<br/>
of the defile the barren cliffs of the Sinai group become visible,<br/>
and a view is at length obtained of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ram </span>plain, surrounded<br/>
by lofty mountains, and not unlike a huge amphitheatre. At the<br/>
end of the valley rises the bold and conspicuous rock, known as<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rois </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ee.Saf.soff </span>(p. 513), which the members of the last Sinai<br/>
expedition, following Dr. Robinson, believe to be the true scene<br/>
of the promulgation of the law. The plain of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Er-Raha</span>, which we<br/>
reach by at first descending a little, and afterwards ascending, the<br/>
path improving as we advance, is supposed by the same travellers<br/>
and explorers to have been the camping-place of the Israelites<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>A dark-green spot, in which antimony is probably to be found,<br/>
is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kohli </span>after that mineral. After having crossed another<br/>
slight eminence, we reach the sand of the plain. A block of rock<br/>
lying here (perhaps an old boundary <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, bearing peculiar<br/>
marks, is the subject of an Arabian tradition, to the effect that<br/>
the Gindi tribe, having been unjustly treated by the monks<br/>
of the monastery of St. Catharine, who favoured the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jeheliyeh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tp</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>503), struck their lances into this block in token of <span style="color: #ff0000;">confirmation<br/>
</span>of the oath of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheikh</span>, that the monks should never pass this<br/>
stone. About <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span>hr. after leaving the summit of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nakb </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elnawi</span>, we pass, on the left, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">month </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wfidi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esh-Shékh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">7p</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5'20</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">which </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">commanded </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">by </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebct </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ed-Dér </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">520</span>) on<br/>
the E. The gorge, called the Wadi <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shu'aib<br/>
</span>(valley of Jethro), ascending gradually, and closed by the hill of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mundja</span>, opens before us. To the left of its entrance rises the hill<br/>
of Harlin, on the summit of which Aaron (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Harlin</span>) is said to have<br/>
set up the golden calf. In the vicinity are the remains of stone<br/>
huts, built <span style="color: #0000FF;">by'Almis </span>Pasha in 1853 and 1854 for the workmen<br/>
and soldiers who attended him. We enter the Shu'aib valley, flanked by enormous cliffs of reddish-brown granite, towering to a<br/>
dizzy height. In 1/2 hr. more we reach the terraces of the green<br/>
garden of the monastery which lies to the right of the path, and<br/>
the caravan stops in front of the monastery.<br/>
<br/>
Accommodation. Formerly, when the monks were frequently attacked<br/>
by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>of the peninsula, visitors were drawn up into the monastery through an opening over the gate, which was always carefully<br/>
closed, by means of a rope with a wooden cross attached to the end.<br/>
At the present day the traveller presents theletter of introduction which<br/>
<br/>
he has obtained through his Consulate at Cairo<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and is admitted by a<br/>
aide-door. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>and camels remain outside. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">monastery<br/>
