<span>52 THE MODERN EGYPTIANS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turks </span>I<br/>
<br/>
slaves, and special <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>are appointed to watch over their interests.<br/>
<br/>
The negroes, who voluntarily settle in Egypt in considerable<br/>
numbers, form the dregs <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span>people and are employed in the most<br/>
menial <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>. Most of the negro races of Central Africa to the N.<br/>
of the equator are represented at Cairo, particularly in the rank and<br/>
file of the negro regiments.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ethnogrepherst </span>linguists, or other <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>men who desire to see<br/>
specimens of as many different races as possible should obtain an introduction to an Arabian merchant in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gaincliyeh</span>, who will conduct<br/>
them to merchants from every part of the interior and of the African<br/>
coast, each attended by his <span style="color: #0000FF;">staff </span>of negro servants. The latter, however,<br/>
especially if lung resident in Egypt, cannot give trustworthy information<br/>
about their country and their origin. Some of them have forgotten their<br/>
mother tongue and <span style="color: #0000FF;">even </span>the name of their native country.<br/>
<br/>
Foreigners are prohibited from taking negro servants out of the<br/>
country, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>if through the intervention of their consul they obtain permission <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>must <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>security for their subsequent restoration.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">7 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tue </span>Although the dynasty of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroys </span>of Egypt is<br/>
of Turkish origin (see <span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>106), a comparatively small section of the<br/>
community belongs to that nation, and their numbers appear to be<br/>
diminishing. The Turks of Egypt are <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>to be found in the towns.<br/>
where most of them are government officials, soldiers, and merchants.<br/>
The Turkish <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>are much to blame for the maladministration<br/>
which so long paralysed the rich productiveness of the valley of the<br/>
Nile, having always with few exceptions been actuated in their proceedings by motives <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofreckless </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cupidity </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">withontregard </span>to ulterior consequences. Now, however, that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">government </span>of the Khedive has<br/>
adopted more enlightened principles, it has admitted other nationalities also to its highest civil appointments, some of which are held<br/>
by able Europeans, and under their auspices a brighter future is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">probably </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>store for Egypt. The Turkish merchants are generally a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">prosperous </span>class, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span>, although fully alive to their pecuniary interests, they are dignified and courteous in their <span style="color: #ff0000;">hearing</span>, and are<br/>
often remarkable for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">handsomeness </span>of their features.<br/>
<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">8</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">LEVANTINES</span>. A link between the various classes of dwellers<br/>
in Egypt and the visitors to the banks of the Nile is formed by the<br/>
members of the various Mediterranean races, known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Levantines</span>,<br/>
who have been settled here for several generations, and form <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ineonsiderable </span>element in the population of the larger towns. Most of<br/>
them profess the Latin form of Christianity, and Arabic has now become their mother tongue, although they still speak their old national<br/>
dialects. They are apt linguists, <span style="color: #0000FF;">learning </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>European languages with<br/>
great rapidity, and good men of business, and owing to these qualities they are often employed as <span style="color: #0000FF;">shopmen </span>and clerks. Their <span style="color: #ff0000;">servicds </span>have also become <span style="color: #0000FF;">indispensable </span>at the consulates as translators<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">eocuments </span>destined for the native authorities, and as bearers of<br/>
communications between the respective <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices</span>. A large proportion<br/>
of them are wealthy. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Being </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Christians</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Levantines </span>all live under<br/>
the protection of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>consuls, and thus unfairly <span style="color: #0000FF;">escape<br/>
