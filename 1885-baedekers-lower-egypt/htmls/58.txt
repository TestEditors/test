<span>36 GEOGRAPHICAL NOTICE. Population.<br/>
<br/>
Another kind of landed <span style="color: #ff0000;">property </span>is called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ab'zldl'yeh</span>, by which is<br/>
meant the uncultivated land presented by the Khedive to suitable <span style="color: #0000FF;">persons </span>with full right of property on condition of its being reclaimed <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
</span>cultivated. Estates of this kind pay no taxes for the first three years, after<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>per cent on the value of the produce is levied ('ushr). The rest of<br/>
the land is <span style="color: #0000FF;">officially </span>known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Etht-dgh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h</span>, i.e. government estates.<br/>
Nearly the whole of the soil of Egypt is thus in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hands </span>of government.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>peasants are merely tenants for life, or so long as they <span style="color: #0000FF;">continue </span>to pay their ground-rent (<span style="color: #ff0000;">khm'dg</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>According to the Koran, an estate<br/>
on the death of the life-tenant reverts to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bit </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">et-mut</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>government<br/>
treasury, as the common property of all Muslims; but a humane law of<br/>
1857 provides that it may be claimed by the next of kin of both sexes<br/>
on payment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">21 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Pmiu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Washes </span>per <span style="color: #0000FF;">feddan </span>for registration of the title.<br/>
The trees planted by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">life-tenant</span>, and the buildings and irrigating<br/>
apparatus erected by him, are his property, and pass to his heirs. The<br/>
right of occupation, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">usufruct</span>, of these lands may also be sold, let, or<br/>
mortgaged; but the contract must <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>ratified by government in each <span style="color: #0000FF;">easel<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>mortgaged lands are not redeemed within fifteen years, they<br/>
continue in possession of the mortgagee and become his property. A<br/>
piece of land may at any time be taken possession of by government for<br/>
public purposes (<span style="color: #0000FF;">railways </span>canals, <span style="color: #0000FF;">embankments</span>), in which <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>the occupant receives another piece of land elsewhere as compensation.<br/>
<br/>
The ground-tax (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mm-rig</span>) is in <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>cases as high as 20 per cent.<br/>
Instead of a certain tax being imposed on each village as formerly, the<br/>
tax payable by each estate is now fixed by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">illudiriyeh </span>or chief<br/>
authorities of the province. To facilitate the collection of taxes, all<br/>
landed estates are formed into groups, generally consisting of properties<br/>
taxed at the same rate, and known in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lower </span>Egypt as <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">16¢ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper<br/>
</span>Egypt as <span style="color: #ff0000;">lcabcilrh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In <span style="color: #0000FF;">certain </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">poor </span>districts where there was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>in collecting<br/>
the taxes in the reign of Mohammed'Ali, payment was undertaken by<br/>
a number of capitalists, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>Were empowered to <span style="color: #0000FF;">recover </span>them <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fellahin</span>. This right, however, was not transferable, and it could be<br/>
resumed by the government at any time. Groups of estates where this<br/>
system still prevails are <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ruhdeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Since <span style="color: #ff0000;">1322 </span>several attempts have been made at a comprehensive scheme<br/>
of land valuation, but none has been carried out for more than a few<br/>
limited districts. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1111879</span>, however, a land valuation <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span>was established<br/>
at Cairo in connection with the projected reforms in the land-tax.<br/>
<br/>
Population. The population of Egypt has been ascertained to<br/>
have been greater in ancient than in modern times; for, disregarding the exaggerated calculation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theocritus</span>, based on a mere assumption, it appears to have numbered at least 71/2 million souls in<br/>
the time of Josephus and the Emperor Nero. This number is <span style="color: #0000FF;">quite<br/>
</span>reasonable.in itself, as it is estimated that the country could support <span style="color: #ff0000;">8-9 </span>million inhabitants.<br/>
<br/>
According to the enumeration made by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amiei </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Boy </span>in 1882 the<br/>
present population of Egypt proper is <span style="color: #ff0000;">6,81 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1,449</span>, or about <span style="color: #ff0000;">000 </span>per<br/>
square mile, and is therefore denser than that of most European<br/>
states. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">thickest </span>population is found in the province of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esnch</span>,<br/>
the thinnest in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Faynm </span>and in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Behéreh</span>. The sexes occur in almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">equal </span>proportions. The number of houses enumerated in the<br/>
same <span style="color: #0000FF;">census </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">1,090,000</span>, distributed <span style="color: #0000FF;">among </span>12,876 towns, villages, and hamlets. The population of the provinces beyond the<br/>
limits of Egypt proper, on the other hand, has never been ascertained by any regular census, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>can therefore only be estimated<br/>
<br/>
in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">conjecture </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>way. The densest population is that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pro<br/>
