</span>in Greek, and a few in Coptic and Arabic. They are roughly and <span style="color: #0000FF;">superficially </span>engraved on the rock, which has been very rarely smoothed for<br/>
the purpose, and the small figures are often extremely rude and <span style="color: #0000FF;">inartistic</span>. They represent armed and unarmed men, travellers and<br/>
warriors, laden and unladen camels, horses with and without riders and<br/>
attendants, mountain goats, ships<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>crosses, and stars. A priest with<br/>
raised arms, and an equestrian performer, are worthy of notice. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ctmmns<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tIndirvpbeustmi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Indian </span>traveller<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>), who visited the Peninsula of<br/>
Sinai in <span style="color: #0000FF;">All </span>535 and saw these inscriptions, believed them to be in the<br/>
Hebrew language, and to have been executed by the Israelites during<br/>
the Exodus, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">marvellously </span>preserved by providence, in order that they<br/>
might serve as'witnesses to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unbelieving</span>'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is now ascertained that<br/>
the oldest of these inscriptions cannot have been written earlier than the<br/>
2nd century <span style="color: #ff0000;">B</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">C.</span>, while the most recent are <span style="color: #ff0000;">notlater </span>than the beginning<br/>
of the 4th cent. A.D., and that most of them are to be ascribed to the<br/>
heathen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nabataeans</span>, who adhered to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sabman </span>rites, and worshipped<br/>
the sun, <span style="color: #0000FF;">mount </span>and stars, especially <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>high mountains, such as Mounts<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Scrlial </span>and Sinai. No Christian names occur, but many of the writers call<br/>
themselves'servants'<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'reverers</span>', <span style="color: #ff0000;">or'priests</span>' of the'sun', the'moon', and<br/>
'Baal', and other early Arabian <span style="color: #0000FF;">divinities</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The authors of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions </span>were doubtless travellers, partly merchants, and partly pilgrims<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the holy places in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mokatteb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">among </span>which Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serlial<br/>
</span>was certainly reckoned at a very early period. The inscriptions which<br/>
they rudely engraved to commemorate their visit, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">deciphered<br/>
</span>by Prof. Beer (d. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ISM</span>) of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leipsie</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and afterwards more completely by<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tech</span>. Near the sacred places, and particularly in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wiidi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mekatteb</span>,<br/>
festivals, with markets and shows, were held. Some of the Greek inscriptions are of later date, having evidently been engraved over the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Naliatwan</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">By </span>the figure of <span style="color: #ff0000;">a'Diakonos </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">llinb</span>', a soldier, who was<br/>
hostile to the Nazarenes, has <span style="color: #0000FF;">written</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'a </span>had set of people these<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>I,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">soldier</span>, have written this with my own hand.'<br/>
<br/>
The S. entrance to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Win</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mokatteb</span>, a valley about 31/2 M.<br/>
in length, is closed by a spur of the mountain of that name, which<br/>
our route crosses. Beyond the pass (<span style="color: #0000FF;">152011</span>), whence we obtain an<br/>
excellent survey of the imposing mass of Mt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Serbal</span>, the route<br/>
traverses heights and hollows strewn with small stones. The red<br/>
rubble looks like fragments of bricks, and the slopes resemble<br/>
dilapidated walls of loose stones.<br/>
<br/>
After <span style="color: #ff0000;">3/4hr</span>. we enter the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dei </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Firan</span>, which is here of considerable breadth. This valley, which is probably the most important<br/>
in the peninsula, begins above the Oasis of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Firein</span>, at the base of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Serbfil</span>, and, after describing a wide curve, terminates near the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">coast </span>The granite slopes, flanking the valley, are not far apart at<br/>
places, while in other parts the valley expands to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>considerable<br/>
width. The grey primitive rock, veined with reddish-brown porphyry and black <span style="color: #0000FF;">diorite</span>, rises in picturesque forms; these veins<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">run </span>almost invariably from N. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">s. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesqueness </span>of the<br/>
scene is greatly enhanced by the imposing summits of the barren<br/>
mountains towering above the slopes of the valley to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">south<br/>
</span>At the entrance of the valley, where at the foot of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>the small <span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>of that name opens on the left, are several round<br/>
heaps of stones belonging to ancient tombs. On our right next<br/>
diverges the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Watch </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nediyeh</span>, on the left the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dei </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cr-Remmrfineh </span>and<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wofdi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mokhtres</span>, and to the right again the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wtdi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Feehtlieh</span>,<br/>
the two last being commanded by peaks of the same names. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
