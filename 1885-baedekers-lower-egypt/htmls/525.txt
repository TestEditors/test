<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayem</span>. LABYRINTH. 9. Route. 461<br/>
<br/>
discovered in 1889 by Mr. Flinders Petrie<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The tomb chamber<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">22 </span>ft. long, 8 ft. wide, and 6 ft. high; it was covered with three<br/>
large slabs of stone and contained two sarcophagi, one of them of<br/>
polished sandstone without inscription, and fragments of an alabaster <span style="color: #0000FF;">vase </span>with the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amcnemha </span>Ill. The chamber was<br/>
filled with <span style="color: #0000FF;">water </span>to a depth of 3 ft.<br/>
<br/>
Towards the S. we observe a congeries of chambers and passages<br/>
of unburnt bricks, bounded by the Bahr <span style="color: #ff0000;">esh-Sherlsi</span>, and pronounced<br/>
by Lepsius to be the right side of the Labyrinth, and the only part<br/>
of it which is to some extent preserved. On the other side of the<br/>
Pyramid there was doubtless a similar collection of rooms which has<br/>
now disappeared; and several other structures beyond them, of which<br/>
traces still remain, must have once existed there. The whole Labyrinth must have been in the shape of a horseshoe. Between the wing<br/>
of the Labyrinth which still exists, and that which has disappeared,<br/>
lies an extensive space strewn with broken pottery, in the middle<br/>
of which are large fragments of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>ancient temple. The<br/>
base of the shaft of a small papyrus column, and a capital of the same<br/>
order, both in the red stone of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>, with sculptured stalks and<br/>
foliage, are worthy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">notice </span>Some blocks disinterred here bearing<br/>
the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ill. </span>have again been covered with sand.<br/>
Several large blocks of limestone are also observed in the middle of<br/>
this large court of the Labyrinth. The inscriptions are almost entirely destroyed, but faint traces of painting, and the symbols <span style="color: #ff0000;">o0<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aa</span>) and (u), are still recognisable. From the traces still ex<br/>
isting, the whole structure would appear to have occupied an area<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">8800 </span>sq. yds., and the large inner court an area of about 60 acres.<br/>
<br/>
The Ancient Labyrinth. According to Brugsch, the Greek name Labyrinthos, which has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">differently </span>interpreted, is derived from'erpa',<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">or'elpa-rohnnt</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, i. e. the'Temple of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mouth </span>of the Lake'. The inscriptions found here by Lepsius prove that it was founded by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span>III. of the 12th Dynasty. Herodotus declares that the Labyrinth, which was afterwards reckoned <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lone </span>of the wonders of the<br/>
world<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, was so vast as to surpass all the buildings of the Greeks taken<br/>
together and even the Pyramids themselves. For the best description<br/>
we are indebted to Strabo, who visited the Labyrinth in person. He<br/>
says:'There is also the Labyrinth here, a work as important as the<br/>
Pyramids, adjoining which is the tomb of the king who built the Labyrinth. After advancing about <span style="color: #0000FF;">3040 </span>stadia beyond the first entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the canal, there is a table-shaped surface, on which rise <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>small town<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>vast palace, consisting of as many royal dwellings as there were<br/>
formerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">homes</span>. There is also an equal number of halls, bordered with<br/>
columns and adjoining each other, all being in the same row, and forming one building, like a long wall having the halls in front of it. The<br/>
entrances to the halls are opposite the wall. In front of the entrances<br/>
are long and numerous passages which have winding paths running<br/>
through them, so that the ingress and egress to each hall is <span style="color: #0000FF;">not<br/>
</span>practicable to a stranger without a guide. It is a marvellous fact that<br/>
each of the ceilings of the chambers consists of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>single stone, and<br/>
also that the passages are covered in the same way <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>single <span style="color: #0000FF;">slam<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>extraordinary size, neither wood nor other building material having<br/>
been employed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>ascending the roof, the height of which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">ine</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on..<br/>
