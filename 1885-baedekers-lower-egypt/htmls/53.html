<span style="color: #ff0000;">hallited </span>area <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>, excluding the deserts, as 12,830 <span style="color: #ff0000;">sq.M</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span>the<br/>
area actually under cultivation as 9460 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ssrM</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The alluvial soil of<br/>
the Nile Valley, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">contradistinction </span>to the desert, known among the<br/>
natives by the Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">word'Er-hut</span>', begins at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartfim</span>, at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confluence </span>of the White and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Blue </span>Nile. Following the wide curve<br/>
described by the Nile through Nubia, the length of the valley as<br/>
far as the first cataracts is <span style="color: #ff0000;">98931.</span>, but as the space between the<br/>
river and its rocky banks is very limited, and the irrigation system<br/>
is imperfectly developed, the cultivable area in this part of the<br/>
valley is only about 1050 sq. M. The Nubian portion of the alluvial<br/>
soil of the Nile is thus very <span style="color: #0000FF;">insignificant</span>; and when the ancient<br/>
oracle described Egypt as the country watered by the Nile, and the<br/>
Egyptians as the people who quenched their thirst with its water,<br/>
the river below the first cataract must obviously have been meant.<br/>
<br/>
Divisions and Administration. The ancient prehistoric Egyptians were at first subdivided into numerous tribes, who formed<br/>
a number of distinct small and independent states, with their<br/>
own laws and their peculiar tutelary gods. These states were<br/>
afterwards gradually united into the two large principalities of<br/>
Lower Egypt or the Northern Country (To <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maw</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>To Melt), and<br/>
Upper Egypt or the Southern Country (To Res, or To <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fem</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. At<br/>
a later period these two larger states, united under one <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sceptre</span>,<br/>
formed the empire of the Pharaohs, or the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fend</span>. The<br/>
smaller states then constituted provinces or nomes <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Egyptian <span style="color: #ff0000;">liesoph</span>;<br/>
Greek <span style="color: #ff0000;">nomoi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. The ancient Egyptians divided each <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>into four<br/>
principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">parts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">( </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>The capital (Nut), the religious and administrative centre of the province; (<span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>) The cultivated land (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Um</span>,<br/>
subject to the annual inundation; <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p</span>) The marshy land which remained in a moist condition after the inundation; (<span style="color: #ff0000;">4 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>The district<br/>
traversed by canals conducted out <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Nile. The civil and military administration of the nome was presided over either by hereditary governors (hilt), or by <span style="color: #0000FF;">nomarchs </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">mer-mat-Ot-to</span>) appointed<br/>
by the king. Under the Ptolemies these governors were called <span style="color: #ff0000;">strutegoi </span>(nomu) <span style="color: #ff0000;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nomarchoi</span>, and over a group of these presided an <span style="color: #0000FF;">cpir<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">strategos</span>. The chief authority in religious matters was the high priest<br/>
of the temple, whose appointment was sometimes hereditary and<br/>
sometimes elective; and his staff consisted of a prophet, a <span style="color: #ff0000;">templescribe</span>, a stolistes or custodian of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">vestments</span>, and an astrologer.<br/>
<br/>
The number of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">names </span>varied at different periods. Most of<br/>
the classical authors (thus Diodorus, liv. 3; Strabo, xxviii. <span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">3 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]<br/>
</span>enumerate thirty-six. The Egyptian lists, such as that of Edfu,<br/>
mention forty-four, half of them being in Upper and half in Lower<br/>
Egypt (but two of those in Upper Egypt and three in Lower Egypt<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>counted twice). The Greeks and Romans sometimes divided<br/>
Egypt into three parts <span style="color: #ff0000;">~</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>Upper, Central, and Lower Egypt, or the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Theba'is</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heptanomis</span>, and Delta.<br/>
