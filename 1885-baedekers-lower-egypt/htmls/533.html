us,'caused this monument to be erected to his gods in <span style="color: #0000FF;">indestructible<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">characters</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Among the domestic animals are several cattle of very<br/>
bright colours. We also notice a gazelle <span style="color: #0000FF;">hem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hy </span>a butcher,<br/>
who is cutting <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>its head. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Offerings </span>of wine were also made at this<br/>
early period. In the passage leading to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>is a group of labourers busily at work. The hunting-scenes are curious, and, notwithstanding<br/>
their simplicity, remarkably true to nature. Among them is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">greyhound<br/>
</span>seizing a gazelle by the leg, and another carrying a <span style="color: #0000FF;">long</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eared </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hare<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>few paces to the N. E. is another mastaba built of <span style="color: #0000FF;">well </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span>blocks<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">limestone</span>. The hieroglyphics and low reliefs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>resembling those in<br/>
the tomb of Ti at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sahkarah</span>, are admirably executed. The deceased <span style="color: #0000FF;">interred </span>here was named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Intent</span>, and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>Mara. Traversing the vestibule and a narrow passage, we reach a tomb-chapel with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial<br/>
</span>table<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>in the passage, on the right, is a handsome male figure with a<br/>
lasso, and on the left are <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-masons</span>, engaged in making sarcophagi.<br/>
On the left, in the innermost niche of this tomb, we perceive the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deceased</span>, and on the right, his wife. We next come to a ruined mastaba,<br/>
and to another tomb, half excavated, which was constructed for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rahatep</span>, a son of Snefru, one of the highest civil and military dignitaries of<br/>
the kingdom, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>his wife Nefert, a relation of the royal family. The<br/>
statues of this married couple, who died young, or at least are so <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented</span>, which are now among the principal treasures of the museum of<br/>
Gizeh, were found here. Farther to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">w. </span>are several other tombs, <span style="color: #ff0000;">new<br/>
</span>covered up.<br/>
<br/>
On the right bank of the Nile, opposite <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rikka </span>upwards of 3 M. inland, is situated the small town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aging</span>, where a heap of earth and<br/>
broken pottery represents the scanty remains of the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aphloditopolis</span>, the territory of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, according to Strabo, adjoined that <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Achm<br/>
</span>thus (Dahshur), while its <span style="color: #0000FF;">capital </span>lay on the Arabian bank of the Nile.<br/>
The city of Aphrodite must have been the same as that of the Egyptian<br/>
Hathor, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom </span>also was sacred the white cow, which, as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Straho </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ine<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">forms </span>us, was worshipped here. The monuments, however, show us,<br/>
that in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>of Aphroditopolis, Horus, the son of Isis, was more<br/>
highly revered than any of the other gods, among <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>must be<br/>
included. At an early period the Coptic name of the place was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tpeh</span>,<br/>
from which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Atho</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabian </span>name <span style="color: #0000FF;">AMI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">derived<br/>
<br/>
</span>About A. D. 310 the city of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aphroditopolis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">gained </span>some celebrity from<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">St. </span>Anthony, the anchorite, who took up his quarters among the mountains to the E. of the town. So many devotees of every class made pilgrimages to him, that a regular high-road, practicable for camels, had to<br/>
be constructed, which led the pilgrims through the desert to the cell of<br/>
the hermit, situated near a group of palms and a spring. The saint,<br/>
however, escaped from his visitors, by retiring farther into the heart of<br/>
the mountains (see <span style="color: #0000FF;">below </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>Near the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zdwiyeh </span>(W. bank) a small canal runs out of the<br/>
Nile into the Bahr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Yusuf </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">11.4561-a </span>deep cutting also seems to have<br/>
connected the river with the Bahr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Yusuf </span>in the latitude of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abnas </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ellllediueh </span>and Beni <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suef</span>. These four channels enclosed an island which<br/>
has been identified with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jreeaeleopolitan </span>Nome, unanimously <span style="color: #0000FF;">described </span>by Greek authorities as an island. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span>, who visited it on<br/>
his way to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fay-iui</span>, after leaving the Nome of Aphroditopolis,<br/>
describes it as a large island, and informs us, that the inhabitants of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ffeeaeleopolis </span>worshipped the ichneumon, the greatest enemy of the crocodile, which was held sacred in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arsinoe</span>; for, as he tells us,<br/>
it crawls down the throat of the sleeping monster and devours its<br/>
entrails. The large hills of rubbish near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Agents </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elalledineh </span>have been<br/>
satisfactorily identified with the ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heracleopolis- </span>they lie about <span style="color: #0000FF;">H </span>M.<br/>
inland from Beni <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suef</span>, and are called by the Arabs <span style="color: #0000FF;">iiiA </span>el- <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jmndrt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>'mother<br/>
of the heaps of rubbish"<span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">An </span>excursion to them, however, is not recommended, unless the traveller is visiting Beni <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sher </span>from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fayfim</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the W. bank of the Nile the mountains <span style="color: #0000FF;">recode </span>a considerable<br/>
distance, while on the E. bank <span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>steep and lofty spurs frequently extend down to the bank in <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unpicturesque </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">forms</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>None of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile<br/>
