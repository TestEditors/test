<br/>
from Pa Hebit. Some idea of the immense changes which have<br/>
taken place in the vegetation of this region since the era of hieroglyphics may be formed from the fact that, while the papyrus plant<br/>
was sedulously and successfully cultivated on both banks of the<br/>
Nile in the neighbourhood of Sebennytus, not a single specimen of<br/>
this useful plant is now to be met with, either here or in any other<br/>
part of the Delta. On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. side of the ruins of the temple<br/>
lies the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Behbit</span>, and adjoining it still exists the sacred<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lake </span>of the temple. The ruins of the venerable sanctuary of Isis<br/>
form an imposing and most picturesque mass of blocks, fragments<br/>
of columns and architraves, ceiling slabs, and other remains, <span style="color: #0000FF;">altogether </span>about 400 paces in circumference. We are reminded of<br/>
the animal sacred to Isis by the reliefs of cows and of <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>with<br/>
cows' heads on several of the blocks of stone. The name of<br/>
Ptolemy II. Philadelphus I. (13.0. 284-246)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">284-22 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">O</span>, the founder of<br/>
the temple, occurs in several places. The structure must have<br/>
been a very costly one, as it consisted entirely of beautiful granite,<br/>
chiefly grey, and partly red in colour, brought from a great distance.<br/>
The sculptures (<span style="color: #ff0000;">hautreliefs </span>and reliefs en <span style="color: #0000FF;">crew</span>) are most elaborately<br/>
executed. Several of the female heads and busts, and some of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cows</span>' heads also, are remarkably fine. In some of the inscriptions<br/>
the hieroglyphics are unusually large, in others they are of small<br/>
and elegant form, and in all they are executed in the somewhat<br/>
flourishing style peculiar to the age of the Ptolemies. The chief<br/>
deities revered here were Isis, with Osiris <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus</span>, besides whom<br/>
occur Seb and Nut, Hathor and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>, the triad of Sehu, Tefnut,<br/>
and Anhur, Sebek, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hapi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>the Nile), and Anubis in the form of<br/>
Horus, as the avenger of his father. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>may also remark here that<br/>
Anubis, the martyr, <span style="color: #ff0000;">wasanative </span>of Naisi, or the Iseum, on the site<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>we now stand. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the W. side of the ruins is an interesting large slab of grey granite, veined with red, on which is<br/>
represented the king offering a gift of land to Osiris and Isis,'the<br/>
great divine mistress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIebit</span>'. Higher up there is another block<br/>
of grey granite, with a representation of Isis <span style="color: #0000FF;">enthroned</span>, and of the<br/>
king offering to'his mother' two small bags of the green mineral<br/>
called mafkat and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mes.tem</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">eye-paint</span>. The inscriptions consist of<br/>
the usual formulae regarding offerings. None of them are perfect,<br/>
but many must still be concealed among the ruins. The pylons<br/>
have disappeared, and with them the historical inscriptions also.<br/>
One of the sculptures represents a procession of the gods of the<br/>
nome, but unfortunately their names are not given. In one case<br/>
Isis calls the king'her brother'. Adjoining a figure of the goddess<br/>
is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'Isis</span>, mistress of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hebit</span>, who lays everything<br/>
before her royal brother'. On a grey block of granite, lying in an<br/>
oblique position, is represented the sacred bark of Isis, resembling<br/>
those seen elsewhere in bronze only. The cabin is like a house of<br/>
two stories, in the upper of which sits the goddess, with cow's <span style="color: #ff0000;">horns<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
