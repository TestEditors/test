</span>PREFACE.<br/>
<br/>
The present volume is the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>series <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">HANDBOOKS </span>FOR THE EAST now in course of preparation, and designed, like the Editor's <span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>handbooks, for the guidance of travellers.<br/>
<br/>
The materials from which the first edition of the Handbook for Lower Egypt was compiled were partly furnished<br/>
by Professor <span style="color: #0000FF;">G. </span>Ebers of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Leipsic</span>, while articles on special<br/>
subjects, as well as many additions and emendations, were<br/>
contributed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>number of other writers. The Editor is<br/>
specially indebted to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Professor </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Asclzerson </span>and Dr. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Klunzingcr<br/>
</span>of Berlin, Dr. G. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Schweinfwth </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Franz </span>Bey of Cairo, Professor <span style="color: #ff0000;">Son</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of'l'iibingen</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>To several English gentlemen who contributed a number of<br/>
valuable corrections and suggestions, and particularly to the<br/>
distinguished Egyptologist, Dr. Samuel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Birth</span>, the Editor<br/>
also begs to tender his grateful acknowledgements. The<br/>
corrections and additions for the second edition have been<br/>
mainly furnished by Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schweinfurth</span>, Dr. Spitta Bey (late<br/>
librarian to the Khedive), and Emil <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brugsclz </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bey</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>all of<br/>
Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The Editor has also repeatedly visited Lower Egypt for<br/>
the purpose of obtaining the most recent practical <span style="color: #0000FF;">information</span>, of the kind most likely to be useful to travellers.<br/>
As, however, a tour in the East is attended with far greater<br/>
difficulty than in Europe, and sources of information are far<br/>
less abundant, the Handbook must necessarily contain many<br/>
imperfections, and the Editor will therefore gratefully avail<br/>
himself of any communications which his readers may kindly<br/>
contribute, as many of them have so generously done in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of his European handbooks. As Oriental life and scenery<br/>
differ widely in many respects from European, and can hardly be appreciated without some previous study, the Editor<br/>
has <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to supply the traveller with all the most<br/>
necessary preliminary information, believing that it will be<br/>
acceptable to most of his readers, although <span style="color: #0000FF;">somewhat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond<br/>
</span>the province of an ordinary guide-book.<br/>
<br/>
The MAPS and PLANS have been an object of the Editor's<br/>
special care, as he knows by experience how little reliance<br/>
can be placed <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">information </span>obtained from the natives, even<br/>
when the traveller is conversant with their language. The<br/>
maps of the Handbook are based upon the large maps <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
