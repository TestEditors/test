<br/>
</span>women, and the third for the men. Within the vestibule (first<br/>
section of the nave), as in most of the ancient Christian churches,<br/>
is a trough in the pavement for washing the feet and other<br/>
ablutions. Beyond the three sections of the nave, and raised by<br/>
a few steps, is the choir where the priests <span style="color: #0000FF;">officiate</span>; and, lastly, we<br/>
observe the <span style="color: #ff0000;">HÃ©kel</span>, or sanctuary, containing the altar, and enclosed<br/>
by a wall, doors, and curtains. Inside the apse rise several steps<br/>
of masonry<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">amphitheatrical </span>fashion, towards the place which in<br/>
European churches is occupied by the episcopal throne, and in<br/>
Oriental by sacred images. The wall separating the sanctuary from<br/>
the choir is panelled and richly adorned with carvings in wood and<br/>
ivory. The oldest of these, probably coeval with the church,<br/>
represent the Nativity, the Eucharist, and the patron saint of the<br/>
church, and are surrounded with ornamentation in wood, <span style="color: #0000FF;">consist-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rectilineal </span>patterns, the basis of which is generally the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>cross <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.Another </span>favourite device, which is often seen<br/>
at Jerusalem, and with which the Copts frequently tattoo their arms,<br/>
consists of the same cross, with four smaller crosses in the angles.<br/>
A narrow flight of twelve steps descends to the Crypt, a small<br/>
vaulted chapel, consisting of nave and aisles. At the end of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>is an altar in the form of an early Christian <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-niche</span>, which<br/>
tradition indicates as the spot where the Virgin and Child reposed;<br/>
in the centre of the aisles are apses. The right aisle contains the<br/>
font<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>into which, according to the Coptic ritual, the child to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>baptised is dipped three <span style="color: #0000FF;">times<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Coptic quarter of Old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cain</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>contains several other <span style="color: #0000FF;">basilicas</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>used<br/>
by Coptic, Greek, and Jewish congregations, but interesting only to those<br/>
who are making a special study of this kind of architecture. Among<br/>
them we may mention the second <span style="color: #ff0000;">Seiyideh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Maryam</span>, or Greek Church of<br/>
St. Mary<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>on an elevated site in the castle of Babylon, and sometimes called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Mo'allai'a</span>. or'the hanging', containing ivory carving and stained glass<br/>
windows. The church of Mari <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menu </span>contains a handsome candelabrum.<br/>
That of <span style="color: #0000FF;">AIM </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sefe'n </span>has a pulpit in coloured <span style="color: #0000FF;">marble</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">inlaid </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">mother<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of-pearl</span>, and a jug and basin with old Arabian enamel <span style="color: #0000FF;">work</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Synagogue </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">EsluShamyrin</span>, nr <span style="color: #ff0000;">Keniset </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Eliycihu</span>) was formerly <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>church of St.<br/>
Michael. The Jews say that Elijah once appeared here<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and the synagogue<br/>
boasts <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">possessing </span>a scroll of the Thorah written by the hand of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Emit</span>. The<br/>
scrolls shown<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>however, are all quite modern. Benjamin of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tudela </span>mentions a synagogue at Old Cairo where <span style="color: #0000FF;">Noses </span>is said to have prayed <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
<br/>
</span>the priest. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Or</span>, partly by way of amusement, they perform the same<br/>
ceremony in the Nile<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>into which they first pour some consecrated water.<br/>
On these occasions the river in Coptic districts swarms with boats. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the eve of this festival<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>as well as on Holy Thursday and on the festival<br/>
of the Apostles, the priest washes the feet of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">whole </span>of his congregation.<br/>
<br/>
It is impossible to resist the impression that the Coptic worship has<br/>
degenerated into a series of mere empty outward ceremonies, and indeed<br/>
the more enlightened members of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seat </span>admit this to he the case.<br/>
Another external form to which they attach great weight is the observance<br/>
of fasts, and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Capt </span>who is negligent in this respect will rarely be met<br/>
with. On these occasions all kinds of animal food, not excepting fat,<br/>
eggs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>butter<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and cheese. are prohibited, and the usual fare consists of<br/>
bread<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>onions<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hit </span>(beans), prepared with <span style="color: #0000FF;">walnut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>mustard-oil, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">duhlfa<br/>
</span>(a kind of salad).<br/>
