<br/>
of soft limestone, without inscriptions, were found in a sand-hill<br/>
in the neighbourhood, belonging probably to a burial-place of the<br/>
quarrymen of the Pharaohs.<br/>
<br/>
These quarries were also worked during the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaio </span>and Roman<br/>
periods; and Strabo, who was generally well-informed, states that the<br/>
quarries which yielded the stone used in building the pyramids lay on<br/>
the Arabian bank of the Nile. He says that they were excavated in a<br/>
very rocky mountain, <span style="color: #ff0000;">called </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span>Trojan<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, and that near them and the<br/>
Nile lay the village of Troja,'an ancient residence of captive Trojans<br/>
who had followed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Menelaus </span>to Egypt and remained there'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus<br/>
</span>gives the same account of the foundation of the Egyptian Troja, but adds<br/>
that Ctesias has a <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>version of it. Both authors were probably<br/>
misled by the statement of Herodotus, that Menelaus was hospitably received in Egypt when returning home with Helen from the siege of Troy.<br/>
There is, however<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>little doubt that the village called Troja by these<br/>
authors is the modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tara</span>, which had no connection <span style="color: #0000FF;">whatever </span>with<br/>
the city of Priam. Inscriptions dating from the ancient empire and<br/>
others of the later monarchy, found in the quarries themselves, inform<br/>
us that the ancient name of the place was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ta-ro-fu</span>, or more recently<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ta-roue</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>or region of the wide <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-gateway</span>, whence the stone of the<br/>
pyramids was obtained. This name was corrupted by the Greeks to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Trojan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and as prisoners of state and of war, including many <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asiatics</span>,<br/>
were chiefly employed in the quarries, it was not unnatural to suppose<br/>
that the colony of <span style="color: #0000FF;">quarrymen </span>at the foot of the hill was a settlement of<br/>
captive Trojans. Several slabs of rock <span style="color: #0000FF;">bearing </span>figures and <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>have been found in one of the great rocky halls of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tum</span>. One of these<br/>
represents King Amenophis <span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>18th Dynasty) sacrificing to the gods<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hersheft</span>; and on the other we find him worshipping<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">accompanied </span>by Anubis, Sekhet, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor</span>. The inscription<br/>
under the first slab (with which that on the second is nearly identical)<br/>
runs thus <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the second line <span style="color: #0000FF;">onwards</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'His </span>Majesty ordered new<br/>
