<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">figs</span>, is very muddy. After a ride of fully three hours we reach the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">looks </span>and the bridge <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kandtir </span>Hasan. The large body of water of<br/>
the canal, which is conducted from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bahr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Yfisnf</span>, here falls into<br/>
a channel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which</span>, with many ramifications, conveys it to the fields<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhfir</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The large village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhur </span>(rail. station, see p. 463) lies on the<br/>
border of the second plateau of the province. Those who visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hawara </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">460 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">] </span>reach the first plateau, while the second is crossed on<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhflr</span>; the third lies at our feet when looking down on<br/>
the Birket <span style="color: #0000FF;">srl-forts </span>from the great <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kdm</span>, i.e. the ruin-strewn hill<br/>
to the N. of the village. The handsome house of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shékh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elBeled </span>offers good accommodation, and even quarters for the night.<br/>
The traveller should make a bargain here for a boat with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shékh<br/>
</span>of the fishermen. About 30 fr. for the day, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish </span>for the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">towers </span>(of whom 6-8 are necessary for speed), are demanded.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhfir </span>stands on the site of an ancient, and not unimportant,<br/>
town, of which large heaps of ruins still remain. <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">omen </span>walls are<br/>
traceable in many places. A large building has recently been <span style="color: #0000FF;">excavated </span>by the peasants for the sake of obtaining the hard bricks<br/>
of which it is built, but part of it has already been removed. No<br/>
remains of columns or inscriptions have been met with.<br/>
<br/>
From <span style="color: #0000FF;">seam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>to the Birket <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sl-Furl</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>takes about 11/2 hr. The route<br/>
leads through <span style="color: #0000FF;">sugar-plantation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;</span>. We reach the lake near the peninsula<br/>
known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Gezireh</span>, on which stands <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>heap of ruins. A short distance<br/>
to the W. are the scanty remains of <span style="color: #ff0000;">eZ-Hammctm</span>. The traveller, after<br/>
having ridden to the lake, should not forget to order his horses, which<br/>
return to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhfir</span>, to await him for the return-journey at the spot <span style="color: #0000FF;">where<br/>
</span>he has quitted them, or to order them to meet him in good time on the<br/>
bank of the lake by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nezleh </span>(see p. 464).<br/>
<br/>
The Birket <span style="color: #0000FF;">eI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kurun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[</span>'lake of the horns') owes its name to<br/>
its shape, which resembles that of slightly bent cows' horns. It<br/>
measures 34 M. in length, and, at its broadest part, is about <span style="color: #ff0000;">61/2 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">M.<br/>
</span>wide. It is situated on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>level as the Mediterranean, and<br/>
its depth averages 13 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>greenish water is slightly brackish<br/>
(scarcely <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit </span>for drinking), and abounds in fish, some of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>are very palatable. The right of fishing is let by government, and<br/>
the whole of the fishermen dwelling on the banks of the lake are<br/>
in the service of the lessee, who receives one-half of the catch.<br/>
The boats (<span style="color: #0000FF;">market</span>) are very simply constructed, being without<br/>
deck or mast; the traveller must take up his quarters on the flooring in the stern; none of the boats have sails, for, as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish </span>always go in the same direction as the wind, the fishermen have to<br/>
row against the wind in order to catch them. Numerous pelicans,<br/>
wild duck, and other water-fowl, frequent the lake. The banks<br/>
are extremely sterile; on the N. side are barren hills of considerable<br/>
height. In the middle of the lake rises a mass of rock, resembling<br/>
a table, and serving as a landmark. Near the S. bank, from E. to<br/>
W., lie the villages of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kafr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tamtyelt</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tirseh</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Senhzir</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abuksa</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beshuai</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ai</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n't </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Gonsheh</span>; the ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dimeh </span>are situated on the N.<br/>
