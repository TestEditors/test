<br/>
Even if we assume that the volume of water was more copious in the<br/>
time of the Exodus, owing to the more luxuriant vegetation, many<br/>
other circumstances would still combine to render it improbable that<br/>
two million persons could have <span style="color: #ff0000;">partaken </span>of it. The probability is that<br/>
these high figures are a mythical embellishment of the historical facts.<br/>
Schleiden has pointed out, that if the Israelites had numbered two<br/>
million as the Bible records, they would have formed a sufficiently dense<br/>
population for the whole peninsula. For <span style="color: #0000FF;">such </span>a gigantic caravan a million gallons of water a day would hardly have <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficed</span>, without allowing<br/>
for the cattle, and at the present day the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beduins </span>begin to feel anxious,<br/>
when a party of a few hundreds encamps around their springs. The<br/>
number 600,000 has probably originated from the poetical accounts of the<br/>
miraculous preservation of the people, who gratefully ascribed so great<br/>
miracles to their protecting God, in order the more effectually to extol<br/>
his power<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>These numbers should, doubtless, be very greatly reduced,<br/>
and so also should the forty years, which the Israelites are said to have<br/>
spent in the wilderness. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>was obviously the purpose of their leaders<br/>
to inure the people to the privations of the desert, in order to prepare<br/>
them for the battles they were about to fight in Palestine, but the sacred<br/>
number forty, which is so often repeated, and which was used to signify<br/>
a generation, most probably indicates a term of years<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>we may also<br/>
observe that Moses was forty years old when he fled, eighty when he led<br/>
the people into the wilderness, and one hundred and twenty when he<br/>
died<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The fact that the Arabian literature contains a number of writings <span style="color: #ff0000;">called'Arbainftt</span>', or tales in which the number forty plays <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>conspicuous part, <span style="color: #0000FF;">alfords </span>a confirmation of the above view.<br/>
Immediately before us rises the curiously shaped Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gharandel </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gerendel</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharaudel</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gurundel</span>), the name of which occurs at an early period. Its slopes have been compared to'petrified<br/>
cushions<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. It is possible that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>descends to the Gulf<br/>
of Suez gave its name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Charandra</span>, used during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roman </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">period</span>,<br/>
to the N. part of the Arabian gulf, where Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll</span>. founded the<br/>
town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoii</span>. In the Itinerary of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Antonine </span>the place is called<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gurandela</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Gharandel </span>(reached in 2 hrs. from the spring in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Beware</span>), which runs for a long distance to the N.E., affords,<br/>
near the sea, and particularly at the spot crossed by the Sinai route,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">amoderate </span>supply of slightly brackish, but drinkable, water, especially after heavy rain, in consequence of which the desert here is<br/>
clothed with pleasing, though not luxuriant, vegetation. Among<br/>
the plants are several lofty and bushy palms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">seyz'il </span>trees (p. 486),<br/>
gharkad shrubs, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">tamarisks</span>. Small groups of rocks on the<br/>
margin of the oasis enhance the comparative <span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesqueness </span>of<br/>
the valley, which was perhaps once better watered and more richly<br/>
clothed with vegetation. Thus B. <span style="color: #ff0000;">von </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Breideubach </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span>15th cent),<br/>
one of the first travellers who identified Gharandel with Elim,<br/>
observed here a shrub bearing nuts, about the size of hazel-nuts,<br/>
and known as Pharaoh nuts, but which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>extinct. If this is<br/>
the Elim of the Bible, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>springs and 70 palm-trees are<br/>
greatly reduced in number. The remains of two <span style="color: #0000FF;">hermit-cells</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn<br/>
</span>in the rocks, are not <span style="color: #0000FF;">worth </span>visiting. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span>Gharandel, owing<br/>
to its supply of water, is a favourite <span style="color: #0000FF;">camping-place </span>for the night.<br/>
