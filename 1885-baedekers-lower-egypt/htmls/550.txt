<span>484 Route 10. PENINSULA <span style="color: #0000FF;">0F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SINAL </span>History.<br/>
<br/>
informed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Exodus</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">t </span>17,'through the way of the land of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philistines</span>, although that was near; for God <span style="color: #0000FF;">said</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lest </span>peradventure the people<br/>
repent when they see war, and they return to Egypt: But God led the<br/>
people about (<span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>Etham) through the way of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wilderness </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red<br/>
</span>Sea'<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Muses</span>, accordingly, made them leave the route to Syria, and turn<br/>
towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>in the neighbourhood of the fortifications, probably near<br/>
the modern Bir <span style="color: #ff0000;">Makhdal</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">aneiently </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Migdol</span>, which, like the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khetani </span>(Etham), signifies a castle and the tower of a fortress.<br/>
During his long sojourn in the wilderness, after he had slain the Egyptian, their great leader had become familiar with all the routes in this<br/>
region, and as soon as he observed the weakness of his people, almost<br/>
the only course open to him was to avoid the forts, and turn towards<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">8.. </span>in order to lead them round the N. end of the modern Gulf of<br/>
Suez, and through the wilderness of Arabia <span style="color: #0000FF;">Petraea </span>to Canaan. From<br/>
the outset he appears to have had a twofold object in <span style="color: #0000FF;">view</span>; the first<br/>
being to emancipate the people from the Egyptian yoke with the least<br/>
possible loss, and the second to discipline them, and accustom them to<br/>
order, obedience, and nobler pursuits in life, in a locality suited for his<br/>
purpose. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Etham </span>('the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bastions'l </span>the wanderers accordingly changed<br/>
the direction of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">route</span>, and turned to the S. between the W. bank<br/>
of the bitter lakes and the E. slope of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel </span>Ahmed Taber, and,<br/>
after a long and fatiguing march, <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamped </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi-Hahiroth</span>, the name of<br/>
which has been <span style="color: #0000FF;">identified </span>with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">modern </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tAgvild </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">-in </span>being the Egyptian for place). They then <span style="color: #0000FF;">ramped </span>for the last time in Egypt near the<br/>
Red Sea, between Migdol, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>frontier fort, near the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kimbysu</span>,<br/>
where a Roman military hospital afterwards stood (about <span style="color: #ff0000;">9 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ill. </span>to the N.<br/>
of the head of the bay and the scanty remains of the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arsinoi0</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Ataka </span>mountains. This range was <span style="color: #0000FF;">anciently </span>called Ba'al Zephon, and<br/>
on its <span style="color: #0000FF;">commanding </span>summit the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phasnieian </span>sailors used to <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>sacrifices<br/>
to Ba'al Zephon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">F. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wind</span>, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">wafted </span>their ships towards the South.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>Pharaoh heard that the people had not crossed the line of fortifications, and had quitted the route to Syria, on which lay the famous<br/>
temple of the desert on Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Casius</span>, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">Noses </span>had intended <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing<br/>
</span>to his God, it was natural <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>him to <span style="color: #0000FF;">say </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-'they </span>are entangled in the land,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wilderness </span>hath shut them in' (Exodus xiv. 3). His mistrust was next<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mused </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>--'And it was told the king of Egypt that the people <span style="color: #0000FF;">tied</span>: and the<br/>
heart <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofPhnraoh </span>and of his servants was turned against the people, and<br/>
<br/>
struction. Diodorus also mentions an expedition undertaken by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Artaxerxes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>King of Persia, against Egypt, during which part of the Persian<br/>
army was lost in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbonic </span>lake, with the dangers of Which they were<br/>
entirely <span style="color: #0000FF;">unacquainted</span>. The main route from Egypt to Syria traversed<br/>
the narrow neck of land between the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbonic </span>lake and the Mediterranean<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see p. 426). The Jews, after their arrival at the lake, first <span style="color: #ff0000;">eucamped </span>at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi-Hah-iroth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Le</span>. the'mouth of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chasms </span>covered with reeds<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>), and<br/>
then followed the usual military route between the waters to the shrine<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ba'al </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Zephon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span>see p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">426</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. They then turned to the S. in consequence<br/>
of the divine command, <span style="color: #0000FF;">traversed </span>the desert of Sitar (see p. 426), and<br/>
arrived in three days at <span style="color: #0000FF;">March </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. bitter), or the three bitter lakes in<br/>
the isthmus (see p. 433). They proceeded thence to Elim, which is<br/>
doubtless identical with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aarlim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tentiim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span>. town of the fishes)<br/>
mentioned by the monuments, a place situated near the Gulf of Suez.<br/>
The Egyptians, however, in the course of the pursuit, as they were traversing the narrow neck of land between the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbonic </span>lake and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mediterranean</span>, were <span style="color: #ff0000;">overtaken </span>by a storm and inundation, lost their way,<br/>
fell into the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbonic </span>lake, and were drowned. The occurrence of such<br/>
floods in this district is borne out by an observation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>that a<br/>
great flood took place during his residence in this region near Mount<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">onsine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tsee </span>Note, p. 426), overflowing the country to such an extent,<br/>
that Mount Casius appeared like <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>island, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>the road to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pales</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tine </span>near it was navigable for vessels. The sea mentioned in the Bible,<br/>
through which the Israelites passed, would, according to this theory, noi<br/>
be the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea but the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sirbonic </span>lake'<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
