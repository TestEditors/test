similar class (comp. p. 233). Natives of the country may often<br/>
be consulted with advantage as to prices, but the traveller must<br/>
be prepared to pay more than persons familiar with the language<br/>
and customs.<br/>
<br/>
The following description of the city is so arranged that even a newcomer will have little difficulty in <span style="color: #0000FF;">finding </span>his way without <span style="color: #0000FF;">any </span>other<br/>
guide. If, however, time be limited, the traveller is recommended to<br/>
get a <span style="color: #ff0000;">commissionnaire </span>or local dragoman (p.233), to show him the bazaars<br/>
in the following order.<br/>
<br/>
The Muski, with its E. continuation the Rue Neuve, is the<br/>
chief thoroughfare of Cairo, nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>M. in length, and runs in a<br/>
nearly straight direction from W. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">E.</span>, from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezbekiyeh </span>place<br/>
to the tombs of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hhalifsi </span>This street, the beginning of which<br/>
has frequently been sketched by European artists, has now to a great<br/>
extent lost its Oriental characteristics, but it still presents many<br/>
picturesque and attractive features (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">244</span>). Among the<br/>
shops, many of which present quite a European exterior, are numerous tobacco and cigar stores, emporiums of clothing, and stalls<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">fez-makers</span>, with the peculiarly shaped iron they use in their<br/>
trade. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>The price of a fez <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tarbfish </span>varies from 2 fr. to 15 fr.<br/>
according to the material with which it is lined.)<br/>
<br/>
On entering the Muski we observe on the right, above us, an<br/>
Arabian school (p. 250). We ascend the street to a small place<br/>
called the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rand-Point </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>, 3). Immediately before this place is<br/>
reached, we diverge to the right, and follow the first lane to the<br/>
left <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>running parallel with the Muski), passing a red and yellow<br/>
mosque on the right, and disregarding the attraction of the European glass wares sold here. Pursuing a straight direction <span style="color: #ff0000;">Li.e.</span>, as<br/>
straight as the crooked lanes admit of), we pass the end of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">narrow </span>lane on the right, through which we perceive the entrance to<br/>
an uninteresting Greek church, and the covered entrance to a bazaar<br/>
lately burned down, on the left. Turning to'the right, we next<br/>
enter the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mils </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Ijamzawi </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, 2, 3), or bazaar of the Christian<br/>
merchants (Syrians and Copts), who vie with their Mohammedan<br/>
fellow-tradesmen in the exorbitance of their demands, and whose<br/>
chief wares are European calico, porcelain, and drugs <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>which last<br/>
are sold at all the bazaars). Near the end of this street, a little<br/>
before its junction with the broader street <span style="color: #0000FF;">El- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghariyeh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see below),<br/>
we observe on the right the <span style="color: #0000FF;">$ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>; <span style="color: #ff0000;">eI-'Atté.rin</span>, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">spice-market</span>, which<br/>
is easily distinguished by its aromatic <span style="color: #ff0000;">odOurs</span>. The perfumes of<br/>
Arabia, genuine and adulterated, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wax-candles</span>, and drugs are the<br/>
chief commodities here. Attar of roses is sold by weight at high<br/>
prices. The small bottles into which it is put have very narrow<br/>
necks, through which one drop at a time only can pass. Customers<br/>
should of course see that the bottles are accurately weighed beforehand.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">leyond </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the'Attérin </span>Bazaar (still keeping the <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-GUriyeh </span>carriage way on our left) we next enter its continuation, the Sill<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el<br/>
<br/>
