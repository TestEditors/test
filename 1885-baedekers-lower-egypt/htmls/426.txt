during the Roman period (<span style="color: #ff0000;">13.0</span>. 30). In consequence of the edict<br/>

heretical Monophysites (p. 101) seem to have been very numerous<br/>
here. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Makaukas</span>, the leader of the Copts, was established at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mens<br/>

The Mohammedan conquerors transferred their residence to the<br/>
right bank of the Nile (comp. p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">341 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>, opposite the northernmost<br/>
part of Memphis, using the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-berm </span>blocks, which had once<br/>
composed the venerable palaces and temples of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>ancient city of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mates</span>, for the construction of their palaces, castles, and mosques.<br/>
Memphis, however, was so vast, that it was long before its <span style="color: #0000FF;">plunderers </span>succeeded in entirely destroying it. Down to a late period<br/>
its ruins excited the admiration of all visitors. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thus'Abdallatif<br/>
</span>(at the end of the 12th cent), after a lively account of numerous<br/>
attacks sustained by the enormous city, assures us that even in his<br/>
time, the ruins contained a profusion of wonders which bewildered<br/>
the mind and baffled description<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span>more profoundly we contemplate the ruins (he says), the greater does the admiration become with which they inspire us; and every new survey <span style="color: #0000FF;">we<br/>
</span>take becomes a source of fresh delight.' <span style="color: #ff0000;">0n </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">beholdng </span>the ruins<br/>
he cannot help regarding as pardonable the popular belief, that the<br/>
ancient Egyptians were giants of prodigious longevity, who had<br/>
the power <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofmovingmasses </span>of rock with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">magician</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">wand</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">After<br/>
</span>the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Abdellatif </span>the rapidly dwindling ruins of Memphis are<br/>
rarely mentioned. <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>after stone was transferred as from a<br/>
quarry to the opposite bank of the Nile, and we are told that the<br/>
site was systematically explored by <span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">seekers</span>, who took<br/>

</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Colossal </span>Statue of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>lies in a hollow, having<br/>
unfortunately fallen with its face to the ground. The head is turned towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">DIW</span>. This huge statue was discovered by Messrs.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cavigliu </span>and Sloane (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>in 1820, and presented to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">British<br/>
</span>Museum, but owing to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>of transport it has never<br/>
been removed. It consists of remarkably hard and fine-grained<br/>
limestone, and before it was injured <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">about </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">42 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>in height.<br/>
The workmanship is admirable. The features, which resemble<br/>
the Semitic type, are exactly similar to those of this great <span style="color: #0000FF;">monarch </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Sesostris <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greeks</span>) as <span style="color: #0000FF;">portrayal </span>on numerous<br/>
