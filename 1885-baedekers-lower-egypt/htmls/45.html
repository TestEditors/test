the shopkeepers, from whom they receive 10-20 per cent on all articles purchased by travellers under their guidance.<br/>
<br/>
Travellers are cautioned against purchasing antiquities, their<br/>
exportation being moreover strictly prohibited (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">G</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. Spurious<br/>
'antiquities' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>particularly <span style="color: #ff0000;">scarabzei</span>) are largely manufactured both<br/>
in Egypt and Syria, and the name is unhesitatingly applied<br/>
to everything in the seller's possession, especially in Upper Egypt,<br/>
if he sees that the traveller is disposed to make purchases of the<br/>
kind. Remains of mummies are frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>for sale in the<br/>
neighbourhood of all the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">burial-places</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Both at Alexandria and Cairo there are goods-agents (pp. 206,<br/>
235), who will undertake the transmission of all purchases to the<br/>
traveller's home at moderate cost. Their services are especially recommended if the traveller intends making a tour through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">continent </span>of Europe on his return from Egypt, in which case every<br/>
new article, or object not intended for personal use, is liable to<br/>
duty at <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-a-dozen </span>different frontiers.<br/>
<br/>
(15). Intercourse with Orientals.<br/>
<br/>
Orientals reproach Europeans with doing everything the wrong<br/>
way, such as writing from left to right, while they do the reverse,<br/>
and uncovering the head on entering a room, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>they remove<br/>
their shoes<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>but keep their heads covered.<br/>
<br/>
The following rules should <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>observed in paying a visit at an<br/>
Oriental house. The visitor knocks at the door with the iron knocker<br/>
attached to it, whereupon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">question'min</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>who is there?) is<br/>
usually asked from within. The visitor answers,<span style="color: #0000FF;">'i </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tah</span>' (open). In<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of Muslim houses the visitor has to wait outside for a few<br/>
minutes in order to give the women who happen to be in the court<br/>
time to retire. <span style="color: #ff0000;">He </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">their </span>conducted into the reception-room, where<br/>
a low divan or sofa runs round three sides of the room, the place<br/>
of honour always being exactly opposite the door. According to the<br/>
greater or less degree of respect which the host desires to show for<br/>
his guest he rises more or less from his seat, and approaches one<br/>
or more steps towards him. The first enquiries are concerning<br/>
the health <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>see p. 199); the salutation'Salam <span style="color: #0000FF;">aleikum</span>' is reserved for Muslims. The transaction of business in the East always<br/>
involves a prodigious waste of time, and as Orientals attach no<br/>
value whatever to their time, the European will often find his patience sorely tried. If a visitor drops in and interrupts the business,<br/>
it would be an <span style="color: #0000FF;">unpardonable </span>affront to dismiss him on the plea of<br/>
being engaged. Again, when a visitor is announced at meal-time,<br/>
it is de <span style="color: #0000FF;">rigueur </span>to invite him, at least as a matter of form, to partake.<br/>
At all other hours of the day visitors are supplied with coffee,<br/>
which a servant, with his left hand on his heart, presents to each<br/>
according to his rank. Under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffee-cup </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pngtn</span>) there <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
<br/>
