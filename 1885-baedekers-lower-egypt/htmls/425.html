N. as far as Gizeh, and to the S. about as far as the latitude of the<br/>
Pyramids of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dahshur</span>. The most important quarters of the city and<br/>
many of its public buildings appear to have stood in the fields of<br/>
the villages of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedrash√©u</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mitrahiueh </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iiasriyeh</span>.<br/>

Egyptians at the head <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>their dynasties (having been immediately<br/>
preceded by the dynasty of the gods), and is described as a man of<br/>
This <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">near </span>Abydos in Central Egypt, the district which Diodorus<br/>
calls the oldest part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, is said to have been the founder of<br/>
the Empire, and the builder of Memphis. Herodotus states that he<br/>
was told by the Egyptian priests, that Menes had constructed an<br/>
embankment across the Nile about 100 stadia above Memphis, and<br/>
thus compelled the river, which had formerly flowed past the Libyan chain, to quit its old channel, and to run between the two<br/>
ranges of hills. When the land thus reclaimed had become <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>firm, he built upon it the city of Memphis, situated in the<br/>
narrow part of Egypt. To the N. and the W. of the city, as they<br/>
informed him, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memes </span>caused a lake to be excavated for its defence,<br/>
and to be filled from the river, which protected the town on the E.<br/>
side; while within the city <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>erected the great and memorable<br/>
Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pink</span>. The whole history of the city is associated with<br/>
this vast sanctuary, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">included </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">withinits </span>precincts the temples<br/>
of other gods, was surrounded <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wall</span>, and must have commanded<br/>
the city like a huge castle.<br/>
<br/>
Memphis, like all the Egyptian towns, was known by several different names. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>like the home around it, it was called<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the'city </span>of the white wall<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>after the castle, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>well known even<br/>
in the Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">period</span>. Another name, derived from the deity most highly<br/>
revered by the citizens, was Ila <span style="color: #ff0000;">l'mh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">house </span>of Ptah'), which the Greeks<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">IrrmslMerl </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hephaistopolis </span>Lastly it was known by the popular name of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jferrue.fee</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'gond </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place</span>', or'haven of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">good</span>'. The r at the end of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Men </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Defer </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>then dropped, and thus arose the Coptic form <span style="color: #ff0000;">Allcnfi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nr<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">illemfi</span>, which the Greeks and Romans changed to Memphis, and the Arabs<br/>
to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men/1 </span>The quarter where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">licentious </span>rites of the Egyptian and<br/>
Phoenician goddess of love were celebrated, and where strangers were<br/>
afterwards allowed to settle<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ta-makh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">it'the </span>world of life'.<br/>
<br/>
Menes was succeeded <span style="color: #ff0000;">by </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">his </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sonAtahuti</span>, or Athothis, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whoruade<br/>

Memphis attained its greatest prosperity. Each ofthe Pharaohs extended and embellished the temple. Memphis suffered severely<br/>
from the invasion and during the domination of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">2194-1683</span>). The Pharaohs of the new empire who expelled the<br/>
intruders (p. 89) resided at Thebes, the city of Ammon, but by<br/>
no means forgot their ancient capital, the city of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Plah </span>and Apis.<br/>
During the 21st Dynasty the seat of government was transferred to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sal</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>(p. 445), the proximity of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">featured </span>to Memphis a share<br/>
of its ancient glory, though but for a short period. The city was<br/>
besieged and captured several times by the Assyrians, and also <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
