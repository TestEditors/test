order of <span style="color: #0000FF;">succession </span>based <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the law of <span style="color: #0000FF;">primogeniture</span>, and<br/>
in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1867 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">he</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>was raised to the rank of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>, or Viceroy,<br/>
having previously borne the title of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Haiti</span>, or governor of a<br/>
province only. In 1873 the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive </span>obtained a new <span style="color: #ff0000;">firinau<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">confirming </span>and extending his privileges (independence <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>administration and <span style="color: #0000FF;">judiciaries</span>; right of concluding treaties<br/>
with foreign countries; right of <span style="color: #0000FF;">mining </span>money; right of<br/>
borrowing money; permission to increase his army and navy).<br/>
The annual tribute payable to the Porte was at the same<br/>
time raised to 133,635 purses (about <span style="color: #0000FF;">681</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3L</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>With regard to the warlike <span style="color: #0000FF;">sum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es </span>of the Khedive and the extension of his dominions, see pp<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">29</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">30</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The burden<br/>
of the public debt had now increased to upwards of 100 million pounds, <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>loan after another having been negotiated<br/>
by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finance </span>minister <span style="color: #ff0000;">Isma'il </span>Siddik, who finally became<br/>
so powerful that the Khedive deposed him in 1878 and <span style="color: #ff0000;">cansed </span>him to be privately put to death. The Powers now brought<br/>
such a pressure to <span style="color: #ff0000;">hear </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">an </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>, that he was compelled to resign his private and family estates to the state<br/>
and to accept a ministry under the presidency of Nubar<br/>
Pasha, with the portfolio of public works entrusted to M.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">lilignieres </span>and that of finance to Mr. Rivers Wilson. This<br/>
coalition, however, soon proved unworkable; Nubar <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pasha<br/>
</span>quitted the ministry in consequence of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">lihellive</span>'s encouragement <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>rising among the disbanded <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>of the army,<br/>
and early in 1879 the whole cabinet was replaced by a native ministry under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheri</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>Pasha<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The patience of the Great<br/>
Powers was now at an end; and on the initiative of Germany<br/>
they demanded from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Porte </span>the deposition of <span style="color: #ff0000;">lsma'il</span>,<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">accordingly </span>took place on June 26th.<br/>
<br/>
Isma'il was succeeded by his son Tewfik (pronounced<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Teefilt</span>) or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Taufilr</span>, under whom the government was carried<br/>
on in a more rational spirit, especially after <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rial </span>Pasha became the head of the ministry. The debts were regulated,<br/>
an international commission of liquidation was appointed,<br/>
and an extensive scheme of reform was undertaken. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sept.</span>,<br/>
1881, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, a military revolution broke out in Cairo,<br/>
which had for its objects the dismissal of the ministry, the<br/>
grant of a constitution, and above all the emancipation of<br/>
Egypt from European <span style="color: #0000FF;">influences</span>. The Khedive was besieged<br/>
in his palace and had to yield; he appointed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sherif </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">president<br/>
</span>of a new ministry and arranged for an election <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Notables,<br/>
or representatives. As the latter espoused the'national'<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Faust</span>, Sherif resigned in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">b.</span>, 1882, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahmud </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l'asha<br/>
</span>formed a new ministry, the programme <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>which tallied<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">exactly </span>with the demands of the national party. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">new<br/>
