</span>animals to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mdsa </span>(Moses) here. At the N.E. angle of the rock<br/>
which bears the chapel there is a hollow, where Moses is said to<br/>
have stood when'the Lord's glory passed by', and the monks show<br/>
the impression of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">prophet</span>'s head and shoulders on the stone.<br/>
The tradition is to the effect that Moses remained fasting for forty<br/>
days in a hollow resembling a cistern near the mosque, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>writing<br/>
the ten commandments.<br/>
<br/>
The view is wild and imposing. Towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>rise the<br/>
barren, sombre, and majestic Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Katherin</span>, the<br/>
highest mountains in the peninsula. To the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. we survey the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sebzi'iyeh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Valley</span>, near the foot of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebcl </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Musa</span>, which some<br/>
authorities take to be the <span style="color: #0000FF;">camping-place </span>of the Jews. Above it<br/>
rises a multitude of mountain chains and peaks, <span style="color: #ff0000;">picturesqncly </span>interspersed with intervening <span style="color: #0000FF;">wz'ulis</span>. Towards the E. the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">elMe'allawi </span>is particularly conspicuous. In clear weather the lied<br/>
Sea, and even the greater part of the Bay <span style="color: #ff0000;">of'Algaba</span>, are visible.<br/>
The island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thin </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SHE </span>of the peninsula is also sometimes<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">descried</span>. Towards the N.W. is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Res </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">es-Safsdf</span>, while below us<br/>
lie the valleys of the two monasteries. Beyond these, on the right,<br/>
framing the picture, rise the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebel'Aribeh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Fen</span>', and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Es-Sanna</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>;<br/>
on the left, the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">er-Rabba </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ez-Zafariyeh</span>, with the chateau<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">oCAbbis </span>Pasha. Towards the N., beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ltas </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cs-Sat'saf</span>, we<br/>
obtain a glimpse through the defile of the Nakb <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Tiwi </span>of the less<br/>
mountainous region of the peninsula in that direction.<br/>
<br/>
We descend <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>min. to the cypress plain, whence the guides<br/>
conduct us in 3/4 hr. through two fertile hollows by a slightly<br/>
descending path to a third valley, <span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesquely </span>commanded by<br/>
rocks. The first dale contains the remains of a cistern and a chapel<br/>
dedicated to John the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baptism</span>. From the valley in which this path<br/>
terminates, it is usual to make the ascent of the Res <span style="color: #ff0000;">eg-Safg√©f<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">'mountain </span>of the willow<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>), which many authorities, particularly<br/>
since the time of Dr. Robinson, who is also followed by Prof.<br/>
Palmer, identify with the mountain where the commandments<br/>
were given. We may here enjoy a cool draught from a spring near<br/>
a dilapidated chapel dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Sacred </span>girdle of the Virgin<br/>
Mary', and inspect the venerable willow which gives its name to<br/>
the mountain, and from which Moses is said to have cut his<br/>
miraculous rod. The monks formerly pointed out another bush in<br/>
the monastery garden from which the rod was cut. The ascent of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Safsz'if </span>[ <span style="color: #0000FF;">6540 </span>ft.) is at first facilitated by steps. Farther up the<br/>
path becomes steeper, and the extreme summit can only be attained<br/>
by persons with steady <span style="color: #0000FF;">heads </span>by dint of scrambling. Those who<br/>
are not disposed for this undertaking should take their stand by<br/>
the opening of a chasm which descends precipitously into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Itiha<br/>
</span>plain, situated about <span style="color: #ff0000;">50paces </span>below the summit of the mountain<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
