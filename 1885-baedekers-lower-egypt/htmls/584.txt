<span>514 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">10</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>LEJA-VALLEY. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues<br/>
<br/>
</span>swallowed up the company of Korah, although, according to the<br/>
Bible narrative, the scene of that event must have been at a considerable distance from Mt. Sinai. A hole in the rock is also pointed<br/>
out as the mould of the golden calf.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Leja </span>Valley, which flanks the W. side of the Jebe ] <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mhsa</span>,<br/>
owes its name to an Arabian tradition that Leja <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>a daughter of<br/>
Jethro, and a sister of Zipporah (Arabic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zaffiriya </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">]</span>. At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance </span>we first observe, on the right, the dilapidated hermitages<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">delea </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ated </span>to SS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Earl</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Damianus </span>and a disused chapel of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">welve </span>Apostles. On the left is the ruinous monastery of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Bustr'r'n </span>with a few plantations; farther on we come to a mass<br/>
of rock, called by the Arabs Hujer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maw</span>, or'Stone of Moses<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>,<br/>
and declared by the monks to be the Rock of <span style="color: #0000FF;">floral</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>the spring issued <span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span>struck by Moses. It is probably in accordance<br/>
with an ancient Jewish tradition, with which both St. Paul (1 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cor</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">x. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">expounders </span>of the Koran seem to have been familiar, that the monks assure us that this rock accompanied the Jews<br/>
throughout their wanderings in the desert, and then returned to its<br/>
old place. It is of reddish-brown granite, measures about 130<br/>
cubic yds. in content, and is about 12 ft. high. The S. side is<br/>
bisected somewhat obliquely by a band of porphyry about 16 in.<br/>
wide, from holes in which jets of water for each of the 12 tribes are<br/>
said to have flowed. Two of the holes, however, seem to have <span style="color: #0000FF;">disappeared</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Several </span>Sinaitic inscriptions (p. 494) are to be seen here.<br/>
<br/>
About 20 min. to the S. of this point is the unpretending <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dé'r<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Arbu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'m</span>, or Monastery of the Forty (<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. martyrs), with an<br/>
extensive garden containing olive and other trees. In the upper<br/>
and rocky part of the site rises a spring with a grotto near it, which<br/>
is said once to have been occupied by St. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Onofrius</span>. The monastery was inhabited from the 16th down to the middle of the 17th<br/>
century. Two or three monks reside here occasionally to look after<br/>
the garden. The forty martyrs, from whom the monastery derives its<br/>
name, are said to have been monks who were slain by the Saracens,<br/>
but that event may as probably have taken place at the monastery<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sikelyih </span>on Mt. Serbal (p. 498).<br/>

<br/>
The ascent of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jobs </span>] <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather-in </span>is more difficult than that of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Muse</span>, and is hardly suitable for ladies. The start should be made<br/>
very early, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>previous night should be spent at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arba'in </span>monastery (see <span style="color: #0000FF;">above</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. See map<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>496<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Route </span>as far as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">/2 </span>hrs.) <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dér </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cL-Arba'in</span>, see above. We then<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">follow </span>a gorge to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SAW</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>soon contracts considerably, and<br/>
observe several Sinaitic inscriptions. After <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/4-11/21117</span>. we reach<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Irir </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esh-Shanntir</span>, or'partridges' well', which God is said to have<br/>
called forth for <span style="color: #ff0000;">hehoof </span>of the partridges which followed the corpse<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit</span>. Catharine (see below) when borne to Mt. Sinai by angels.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">route </span>now inclines more to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>and is very steep <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
