Abraham <span style="color: #0000FF;">baring </span>been <span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>into a furnace <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Nimrod for having<br/>
destroyed idols<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and having escaped unhurt <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>probably borrowed<br/>
from the miracle of the three men in the fiery furnace).<br/>

The history of Moses, as given in the Koran, presents no<br/>
features of special interest. He is <span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span>the'speaker of God'; he<br/>
wrote <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'l'horah</span>, and is very frequently <span style="color: #0000FF;">mentioned</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- In the story<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jesus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed </span>has perpetrated an absurd anachronism, Mary<br/>
being confounded with Miriam, the sister of Moses. Jesus is <span style="color: #ff0000;">tyalled </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">rlsi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Koran</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but'Isl </span>is properly Esau, a name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">reproach<br/>
</span>among the Jews; and this affords us an indication of the source<br/>
whence <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammad </span>derived most of his information. On the other<br/>
hand, Jesus is styled the'Word of God', as in the Gospel of St.<br/>
John. A parallel is also drawn in the Koran between the creation<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Adam </span>and the nativity of Christ; like Adam, Jesus is said to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>been a <span style="color: #0000FF;">prophet </span>from childhood, and to have <span style="color: #0000FF;">wrought </span>miracles<br/>
which surpassed those of all other prophets, including even <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammed </span>himself. He proclaimed the Gospel, and thus <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonllrmcd<br/>
</span>the Thorah; but in certain particulars the latter was abrogated by<br/>
him. Another was <span style="color: #0000FF;">crucified </span>in his stead, but God caused Jesus<br/>
also to die for a few hours before taking him up into heaven<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Modern investigation shows with increasing clearness <span style="color: #ff0000;">howlittle<br/>
</span>originality these stories possess, <span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">how </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohammcd </span>merely repeated what he had learned from very mixed sources <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>Jewish, and<br/>
afterwards Christian also), sometimes entirely misunderstanding<br/>
the information thus acquired. The same is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>with the<br/>
numerous narratives about other <span style="color: #0000FF;">so-called </span>prophets. Even Alexander the Great is raised to the rank of a prophet, and his campaign<br/>
in India is represented as having been undertaken in the interests<br/>
of monotheism. Alexander is also associated with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khiglr</span>, or<br/>
animating power of nature, which is sometimes identified with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Elijah </span>and St. George<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The only other matter <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofinterest </span>connected<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mohammed</span>'s religious system is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">position </span>which he himself<br/>
occupies in it. Moses and Christ prophesied his advent, but the<br/>
passages concerning him in the Thorah and Gospels have been suppressed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">lie </span>is the promised Paraclete, the Comforter (St. John<br/>
xiv. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, the last and greatest of the prophets; but he does not<br/>
profess to be entirely free from minor <span style="color: #0000FF;">sins</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ile </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">confirms </span>previous<br/>
revelations, but his appearance has superseded them. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>whole<br/>
doctrine is a miracle, and it therefore does not require to be<br/>
confirmed by special miracles. After his death, however, a number<br/>
of miracles were attributed to him, and although he <span style="color: #ff0000;">wasnot </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">exactly<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">deified</span>, the position assigned to him is that ofthe principal mediator<br/>
between <span style="color: #0000FF;">God </span>and man. The apotheosis of human beings is, <span style="color: #0000FF;">moreover</span>, an idea foreign to the Semitic mind, and it was the Persians<br/>
who <span style="color: #ff0000;">llrst </span>elevated'Ali and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">imams </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">literally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">reciters </span>of prayers)<br/>
who succeeded him to the rank of supernatural beings.<br/>
