<span>to Sinai. <span style="color: #0000FF;">WADI </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TAYYIBEH</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>. Route. <span style="color: #ff0000;">489<br/>
<br/>
</span>The hot springs are situated on the N. side of the mountain, facing<br/>
the sea; they are easily found without a guide, owing to the steam<br/>
which envelopes them. There is a good bathing-place at the point where<br/>
they flow into the sea from the white rock, but the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bather </span>should beware<br/>
of sharks. Higher up, the springs are very hot. When the temperature<br/>
of the air was 90°, that of the water was found to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">153</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. The water<br/>
is slightly saline; according to an analysis made by J. Russegger of<br/>
Vienna, it contains soda, lime, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tale</span>, chloride of hydrogen, and sulphuric acid.<br/>
<br/>
The route continues to follow the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Willi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ignwéseh </span>for 11/4 <span style="color: #0000FF;">hr.Y<br/>
</span>and then crosses the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wridi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eth-Thrtl</span>, a valley of considerable<br/>
breadth, which descends to the sea towards the S.W. in the form of<br/>
a narrow gorge. In about 1/2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">u. </span>more <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>reach the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wtidi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nhebtkeh</span>.<br/>
In less than 1 hr. more we reach the junction of this valley with<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wridi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-IIomr</span>, through which (to the E.) runs the route to<br/>
Sinai <span style="color: #0000FF;">via </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Srtrbfit </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Khddem</span>, described at p. 524.<br/>
<br/>
We follow the valley descending towards the sea, now called<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wadi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Iayyiheh</span>, with numerous windings, some remarkable<br/>
rock formations, several springs of bad water, and a few stunted<br/>
palms. The route traverses a number of round hollows of considerable size, enclosed amphitheatrically by barren slopes of whitish<br/>
grey sand and by rocks. The steep sides of these basins look<br/>
from a distance as if they had been made <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially</span>. The area<br/>
in the centre is often so completely enclosed that no outlet is<br/>
visible. Each quarter of an hour we obtain <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">view</span>, though<br/>
the colouring is always the same. A striking exception to the<br/>
last remark is afforded by the very curious appearance of the Jebel<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tayyibeh</span>, situated near the sea, and consisting of oblique strata of<br/>
different colours; the lowest of these is of a golden yellow tint, the<br/>
next is red, which is followed by a rusty black stratum, while<br/>
the whole is surmounted by a yellow layer.<br/>
<br/>
After <span style="color: #0000FF;">13/4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hr</span>. the valley expands, and we approach the open<br/>
sea, washing the banks of the sandy plain of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Et-Mnhfiir</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>After a<br/>
walk of <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2111</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>. along the coast we reach the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ras </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zeuimeh</span>,<br/>
which still bears the tomb of the saint, and affords <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful<br/>
</span>and sheltered <span style="color: #0000FF;">camping-ground</span>. At this spot <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>more probably than<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">\'adi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tayyibeh</span>, as supposed by some authorities) was situated<br/>
the encampment of the Israelites on the Red Sea (Numb. xxxiii.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">IO</span>). The old harbour is still occasionally used by the fishing-boats<br/>
of the Arabs. In ancient times the roads, by which ore and stone<br/>
were brought from the mines of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Widi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Naghhra </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sarbfit </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elIihadem </span>for farther conveyance by water, converged here.<br/>
<br/>
Beyond <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abfi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Zeuimeh </span>the route at first <span style="color: #0000FF;">skim </span>the sea for<br/>
11/2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">hour</span>. Travellers usually walk here, and amuse themselves by<br/>
picking up shells, as Sinai travellers have done from time <span style="color: #0000FF;">immemorial</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>This <span style="color: #0000FF;">custom </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>mentioned by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thiedmarus </span>in the 13th cent.,<br/>
by Fabri, and by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Breidenbach</span>, the last of whom says, that'various<br/>
kinds of shells are to be found on the coast of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea, and<br/>
also white coral, and many beautiful stones', probably meaning <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
<br/>
