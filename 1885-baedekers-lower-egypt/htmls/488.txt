<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">430 </span>Route 7. THE SUEZ CANAL. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues<br/>
<br/>
</span>ilar project. In 1811 and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1817 </span>Linant Bey, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroy</span>'s engineer<br/>
of waterworks, and Messrs. Stephenson, Negrelli, and Bourdaloue,<br/>
demonstrated the inaccuracy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sre</span>'s observations, and proved<br/>
that the level of the two seas was nearly the same, so that the<br/>
construction of a canal between them was possible. In 1854 M.<br/>
de Lesseps, having matured his plan, laid it before <span style="color: #0000FF;">said </span>Pasha,<br/>
who was then Viceroy, and who determined to carry it out. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Difficulties </span>were thrown in the way of the enterprise by the English<br/>
government during Lord Palmerston's ministry, but on 5th Jan.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">1856 </span>permission to begin the work was formally granted by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">viceroy</span>. A considerable time, however, elapsed before the necessary capital was raised, and it was not till 25th April 1858, that<br/>
the work was actually begun. The Viceroy undertook to pay many<br/>
of the current expenses, and provided 25,000 workmen, who were<br/>
to be paid and fed by the company at an inexpensive rate, and<br/>
were to be relieved every three months. In order to provide these<br/>
workmen with water, 4000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-casks </span>suitable for being carried<br/>
by camels <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>constructed, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">1000 </span>of these animals were<br/>
daily employed in bringing them supplies, at a cost of 8000 fr. per<br/>
day. On <span style="color: #0000FF;">29th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dee</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>1863 the fresh-water canal (p. 409) was <span style="color: #0000FF;">completed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>so that the company was <span style="color: #0000FF;">thenceforth </span>relieved of the<br/>
enormous expense of supplying the work-people with water. The<br/>
hands now employed, among whom were a number of Europeans,<br/>
were less <span style="color: #0000FF;">numerous </span>and much of the work was done by machinery,<br/>
f <span style="color: #ff0000;">92,000 </span>horse-power in all.<br/>
<br/>
On 18th March, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1869</span>, the water of the Mediterranean was at<br/>
length allowed to flow into the nearly dry, <span style="color: #0000FF;">salt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">encrusted </span>basins of<br/>
the Bitter Lakes, the N. parts of which lay <span style="color: #0000FF;">20-40 </span>ft. below the<br/>
level of the Mediterranean, while the S. parts required extensive<br/>
dredging operations.<br/>
<br/>
'The first encounter of the waters of the two <span style="color: #ff0000;">seats </span>was by no means<br/>
of an amicable character; they met boisterously, and then recoiled from<br/>
the attack; but soon, as if commanded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">( </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1105 </span>ego' of Neptune, they<br/>
peacefully mingled, and the ocean once more gained possession of the<br/>
land <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>it had covered at a very remote period, but only on condition of rendering service to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic </span>of the world'. (Stephan)<br/>
<br/>
The cost of constructing the canal amounted to about 19 million<br/>
pounds sterling, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1'2 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,800,000 </span>was paid by the shareholders,<br/>
while the rest of the sum was almost entirely contributed by the<br/>
Khedive. [ In 1875, however, the British Government acquired the<br/>
Khedive's shares for a sum <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">/s,000,00M </span>] The capital was raised in<br/>
the following manner:<br/>
Original <span style="color: #0000FF;">capital </span>in 400, 000 shares of <span style="color: #0000FF;">201. </span>each. <span style="color: #ff0000;">8,000,000l</span>.<br/>
