ceiling richly coloured and gilded. In the more important<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ate </span>houses we sometimes find the walls covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">majolica</span>.<br/>
The traveller will also be struck with the beautiful effects of colour<br/>
produced by the Inlaid Work in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hiblas </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">certain </span>mosques [ the<br/>
tombs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kalm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'m</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tulun</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iiait </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bey </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, where marble, porphyry,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mother-of-pearl</span>, and Venetian enamel have been combined. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>of Cabinet Work the colours used for inlaying are dark<br/>
brown, black (ebony), white <span style="color: #0000FF;">Livery</span>), and bronze. Externally the<br/>
dark yellowish stone of which the buildings were constructed<br/>
produced a naturally pleasing <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>, which the architects <span style="color: #0000FF;">occasionally </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to enhance by colouring every alternate<br/>
course red or black; <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>important parts were adorned with<br/>
marble mosaic, <span style="color: #0000FF;">majolicas</span>, panelling, and gilding. Owing to the<br/>
mildness of the climate of Egypt much of the original colouring<br/>
has been preserved<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>but it must not be confounded with the rude<br/>
and staring painting of stone facades and marble ornaments executed <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the occasion of the opening of the Suez Canal in 1869.<br/>
<br/>
The secular <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices</span>, like the sacred, and particularly the<br/>
Dwelling Houses, have also their characteristic peculiarities. The<br/>
ordinary <span style="color: #ff0000;">town'houses </span>are constructed of stone on the ground-floor,<br/>
and generally have an overhanging upper story. The projecting<br/>
parts sometimes rest on pillars, but more commonly on beautifully<br/>
carved brackets of peculiar form, and are provided with a kind of<br/>
bow-window, which serves the double purpose of ventilating the<br/>
house and of affording a view of the street to the women concealed<br/>
behind the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lattice-work</span>. The small perforated and generally octagonal balconies, with round holes at the bottom, are used for cooling<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">drinking-water </span>in porous vessels (<span style="color: #ff0000;">ltlttlehs</span>), whence they derive<br/>
their name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">MushreMyehs </span>(from <span style="color: #0000FF;">sharab</span>, a draught). These <span style="color: #0000FF;">balconies </span>are rectangular in shape, but their sides are sometimes arched,<br/>
and the lattice-work round them, composed of turned pieces of<br/>
wood, often forms an ingenious and <span style="color: #0000FF;">elaborate </span>pattern. The roofs<br/>
of these mushrebiyehs usually project in a tent-like form, and<br/>
instead of <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornices </span>they have pendent friezes cut out of boards.<br/>
The union of these projections with the surface of the wall below<br/>
is generally masked by means of richly carved and elegantly waved<br/>
mouldings with tasteful rosettes. Above the mushrebiyehs, which<br/>
rarely extend to the height of the apartment within, there are<br/>
usually introduced upper windows, with stucco frames, filled with<br/>
stained <span style="color: #0000FF;">glass</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Corniccs </span>of the houses project but slightly,<br/>
curving a little outwards when pendentives are not employed;<br/>
and they are almost always crowned with pinnacles, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are often<br/>
most elaborately executed. We may also mention the curious form<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ofcoruice </span>seen in the Mameluke Tombs, where the projecting ends<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof-learns </span>are serrated.<br/>
<br/>
While bestowing their full <span style="color: #0000FF;">timed </span>of praise on the wonderfully<br/>
rich <span style="color: #0000FF;">ornamentation </span>and other details of Arabian architecture, <span style="color: #0000FF;">one<br/>
