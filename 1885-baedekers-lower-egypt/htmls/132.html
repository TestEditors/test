in advance to cut <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>this bend and open communication<br/>
with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Klrurtfnn </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shandy</span>, while the main body continued<br/>
its laborious ascent of the Nile. The advanced brigade under<br/>
General Stewart accomplished its <span style="color: #0000FF;">march </span>across the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Buyttda<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Desert </span>(see Map, p. 30) with complete <span style="color: #0000FF;">success</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>gaining<br/>
severely contested victories over large bodies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahdi's<br/>
</span>followers at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alis </span>Klee (Jan. 17th) and at a point near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Illetemmeh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Jam </span>19th). Stewart, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>was mortally wounded at the latter engagement. The British reached the Nile<br/>
at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gubat</span>, just above <span style="color: #ff0000;">Metemmeh</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the evening of Jan.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">10th</span>, and on Jan. <span style="color: #0000FF;">24th </span>a small body of men under Sir Chas.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Wilson </span>set out for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kharpirn </span>in two steamboats which Gordon<br/>
had sent to meet them. Sir Charles reached <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartfim </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">28th</span>, but found that it had already fallen on the 26th, apparently through treachery, and that Gordon was either dead<br/>
or in the hands of the Mahdi. Upon the news of the fall of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">l0artyom </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">British </span>government, after consultation with<br/>
General Wolseley, decided that it was necessary to arrest the<br/>
progress of the Mahdi, and determined to dispatch reinforcements of 10,000 men to <span style="color: #0000FF;">So </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Akin</span>, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">eo-Operate </span>with Wolseley<br/>
from that base. The construction of a railway from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Souakin<br/>
</span>to Berber was also resolved upon. At the time the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Handbook </span>went to press the plan of Wolseley's farther operations<br/>
was not definitely known; but the loss of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartdm </span>and the<br/>
approach of the hot season had greatly complicated his<br/>
task, and the advanced brigade had been recalled to join<br/>
the main body. Though an absolutely trustworthy amount<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the fate of <span style="color: #0000FF;">General </span>Gordon has not yet been received,<br/>
there is almost no room to doubt that he perished at the<br/>
capture of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khartum</span>.<br/>

IV. Hieroglyphics.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">By </span>Professor <span style="color: #0000FF;">6</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">libel-5 </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Leipsic</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The ancient Egyptians used three kinds of writing, the<br/>
Hieroglyphic, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilicmlic</span>, and the Demotic, to which, within the<br/>
Christian era, was added the Coptic. The first and earliest is the<br/>
pure Hieroglyphic writing, which consists of figures of material objects from every sphere of nature and art, together with certain<br/>
<br/>
mathematical and arbitrary symbols. Thus owl, <span style="color: #0000FF;">24L </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">snail</span>,<br/>
axe, <span style="color: #ff0000;">U </span>square<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">! </span>senti. This is the monumental writing,<br/>
<br/>
which is <span style="color: #ff0000;">nftr-uer </span>found engraved on stone than written with a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pen</span>. For the <span style="color: #ff0000;">speedier </span>execution of long records the Egyptians next<br/>
<br/>
developed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">llirzrutic </span>writing, in which the owl (3, i. <span style="color: #ff0000;">c. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.3<br/>
<br/>
</span>almost ceases to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ire</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">recognisable</span>, and in which we possess <span style="color: #0000FF;">literary<br/>
