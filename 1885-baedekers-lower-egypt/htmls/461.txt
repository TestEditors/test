{ <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jel'wc'im </span>an artificial oasis in the desert, 3 M. from the Nile,<br/>
belongs to the Egyptian government, and is placed under the superintendence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Grand-Bey</span>, who is represented at the place itself<br/>
by M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Onsy</span>. The medical inspector is Dr. Engel, a German. In<br/>
spite of the disadvantages of its situation, which necessitate the<br/>
bringing from a distance of drinking water, provisions, and even<br/>
garden mould, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ilelwan </span>has hitherto had a very prosperous existence,<br/>
especially since it came into the hands of the government in 1880.<br/>
It still, however, presents a dull and new appearance, and the<br/>
vegetation around is still very <span style="color: #0000FF;">scanty </span>Visitors who have come to<br/>
Egypt for their health <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>strongly recommended not to remain in<br/>
Cairo, but either to go on at once to Upper Egypt or to pass the<br/>
winter in <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIelwdn</span>, where, besides the baths, they enjoy the advantages of perfect quiet and a remarkably pure and dustless atmosphere<br/>
(comp. p. 67).<br/>
<br/>
The sulphur springs, which were also probably used in ancient<br/>
times, resemble those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Air</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in Savoy in their ingredients. In 1871<br/>
they were utilised for <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanatory </span>purposes by Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Reil</span>, by order<br/>
of Khedive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Isma'il</span>. The principal springs are covered in. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bath-house </span>for Europeans contains fourteen cabinets, for warm and<br/>
tepid baths, <span style="color: #0000FF;">shower-baths</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">inhalation </span>There is also a basin<br/>
containing water strongly impregnated with sulphur, <span style="color: #0000FF;">5-61/2 </span>ft.<br/>
deep, and 1200 sq. yds<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>in area. The interior of the Khedive's<br/>
bath-house may also be inspected.<br/>
<br/>
Near the sulphur springs, especially those situated farther to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">W.</span>, which are still uncovered, a quantity of <span style="color: #0000FF;">flint </span>splinters have<br/>
been found, the largest of which are now in the museum at <span style="color: #0000FF;">1mm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h<br/>
</span>(comp. p. 370). The banks of the Nile afford good wild-fowl shooting, but the desert game is shy and not easily reached.<br/>
<br/>
The subterranean quarries of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ma'sara </span>and Tum, which are<br/>
still worked, yielded the stone used in the construction of the Pyramids. A visit should be paid to these vast caverns, if time permit.<br/>
The ride thither from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helwan </span>takes <span style="color: #0000FF;">11/2 </span>hr.; candles and matches<br/>
should not be forgotten. The stone is transported to the bank of<br/>
the Nile by means of tramways, carts, camels, and mules.<br/>
<br/>
These immense quarries are hardly less imposing than the Pyramids themselves, for which they afforded material. The Arabs make<br/>
very poor miners, as they dread the darkness of shafts and pits.<br/>
They quarry the stone on the outside of the rocky slopes only, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while<br/>
</span>the quarrymen of the Pharaohs penetrated into the interior of the<br/>
mountain and excavated large chambers, tunnelling their way<br/>
until they came to serviceable stone, and leaving the inferior<br/>
untouched. The roofs of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-halls</span>, which are of different sizes,<br/>
are supported by pillars of rock left standing for the purpose. A<br/>
few remains of <span style="color: #ff0000;">hierOglyphics </span>and coloured basreliefs are still preserved in the quarries, but they are of no historical value. During<br/>
the construction of the railway in 1875 a number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi<br/>
