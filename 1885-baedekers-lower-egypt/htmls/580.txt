<br/>
The ascent of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jehel </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mfisa </span>occupies 3 hrs., and presents no difficulty.<br/>
The start should be made about 5 a. m. or earlier. Five <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>paths<br/>
lead to the top<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>but the two following are almost exclusively used. The<br/>
more interesting, but also more fatiguing<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>ascends the old pilgrimage-steps<br/>
(see below). while the other begins in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">midi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Shu'eih</span>, and ascends<br/>
the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">N1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1sa </span>by a circuitous route. This last was to have been made<br/>
practicable for the carriage <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'Abbas </span>Pasha, who intended building himself<br/>
a villa on Mt. Sinai; but he was assassinated before the completion of<br/>
the work (<span style="color: #0000FF;">13</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">5041</span>. Those who wish to ascend the Jebel <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mdsa </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Itis<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>separately may return by the second of these routes; in this<br/>
case they may remain long enough on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jebel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mdsa </span>to enjoy the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>spectacle of a sunset. By starting immediately <span style="color: #0000FF;">alter </span>the<br/>
disappearance of the sun, and walking rapidly, the traveller will have<br/>
time and light enough to descend to the cypress plain <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Chapel of Elijah),<br/>
whence, with the aid of a guide, he may reach the monastery in an<br/>
hour <span style="color: #0000FF;">without</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty</span>, even in the dark, by following the road <span style="color: #ff0000;">of'Abhi'is<br/>
</span>Pasha. The pilgrims' steps should on no account <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>descended at night.<br/>
If necessary the night may be spent in the chapel of Elijah, in which<br/>
case the monks provide blankets.<br/>
<br/>
One or two of the monks or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jebeliych </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">[ </span>Arabian servants of the<br/>
monastery) act as guides, carrying the necessary provisions, and rendering help in the ascent of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ras </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es-Safsaf</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Those who ascend by the pilgrims' steps quit the monastery by<br/>
a small side-gate in its <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>wall, and mount the bare granite of the<br/>
W. side of the Shu'aib valley, by a path which gradually becomes<br/>
steeper, but is unattended with danger. This path, which, like<br/>
many of the Oriental churches, is said to date from the time of the<br/>
Empress Helena, was probably constructed for the pilgrims in the<br/>
6th or 7th <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent </span>In 20 min. we reach a small spring <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>contains<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span>quantity of water in winter and summer, and where, <span style="color: #0000FF;">according </span>to the Arabs, Moses once tended the sheep of Jethro, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom<br/>
</span>they call Shu'aib. The monks, on the other hand, declare that it<br/>
issued from the rock in consequence of the prayers of the holy abbot<br/>
Sangarius, when the wells in the monastery dried up, and that it is<br/>
a cure for diseases of the eye. In 12 <span style="color: #0000FF;">min </span>more we come to a hut,<br/>
styled the Chapel of Mary, which is said to have been erected in<br/>
memory of a vision of the Virgin. The monks, according to the<br/>
story, were so terribly <span style="color: #0000FF;">plagued </span>with vermin, that they determined<br/>
to leave the monastery, and ascended the mountain in procession,<br/>
intending to quit the holy places. On the way, however, on the<br/>
site of this hut, the Virgin appeared to them, promised to deliver<br/>
them from their <span style="color: #0000FF;">tormentors</span>, and commanded them to return. They<br/>
obeyed, and found that all the vermin had disappeared. The traveller, however, even at a late period of the year, will have abundant<br/>
opportunity of observing that the foe has since returned .--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Farther<br/>
</span>up, the route crosses a small ravine, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>then passes through two<br/>
rude gates. Monks are said formerly to have been stationed here for<br/>
the purpose of receiving from the pilgrims, who wished to take<br/>
the sacrament on the top of Mt. Sinai, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">certificate </span>that they had<br/>
attended the confessional in the monastery. At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mst </span>gate they<br/>
were <span style="color: #ff0000;">handedarcceipt</span>, which they gave up at the second. After a <span style="color: #0000FF;">few<br/>
