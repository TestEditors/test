the rebel Mohammed <span style="color: #0000FF;">ihn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abt</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Talih </span>at Medina, but the truth of<br/>
this statement is questionable. It is at all events certain that the<br/>
canal became unserviceable after the 8th century. At a later<br/>
period the Venetians frequently thought of constructing a canal<br/>
through the Isthmus with a view to recover the trade which they<br/>
had lost owing to the discovery of the route round the Cape of<br/>
Good <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hope</span>, and several travellers advocated the scheme; but no<br/>
one seriously attempted to carry it out. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Leibnitz</span>, too, in his<br/>
proposal regarding an expedition to Egypt, made in 1671 to<br/>
Louis XIV., the greatest monarch of his age, strongly recommends<br/>
the construction of such a canal.<br/>
<br/>
'The lord of Egypt, he says,'is not only in a position to do great<br/>
injury to the welfare of the world, as the Turks undoubtedly have done<br/>
by the stoppage of trade; but he might, on the other hand, confer a<br/>
great benefit on the human race by uniting the Red Sea with the Nile<br/>
or with the Mediterranean by means of a canal, in the same way as<br/>
France has merited the gratitude of Europe by the construction of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal </span>along the foot of the Pyrenees. The statement that the level of the<br/>
Red Sea is higher than that of the Mediterranean (as Darius was assured)<br/>
is a mere myth; and even if such were the case, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>opening of such a<br/>
canal would <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>expose Egypt to the danger of inundation<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Sultan Mustafa <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, the admirer of Frederick the Great<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ali<br/>
</span>Bey, the enterprising Mameluke prince, and Buonaparte all<br/>
revived the scheme, and the latter on his expedition to Egypt in<br/>
1798 (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">105</span>) even caused the preliminary works to be undertaken, but the actual execution of the project seemed almost as<br/>
distant as ever. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepere</span>, his chief road engineer, and a man of<br/>
great ability, surveyed the ground under the most <span style="color: #ff0000;">unfavourable<br/>
</span>circumstances, and not without personal danger, but owing to a<br/>
serious <span style="color: #0000FF;">miscalculation </span>he threw great doubt on the feasibility of<br/>
the undertaking. While in reality the level of the two seas is nearly<br/>
the same, <span style="color: #ff0000;">LepE-re </span>estimated that of the Red Sea to be nearly 33 ft.<br/>
higher than that of the Mediterranean. Laplace among others protested against the accuracy of this calculation, as being in <span style="color: #0000FF;">defiance<br/>
</span>of all the laws of hydrostatics, but the supposed obstacle was sufficiently formidable to prevent any farther steps from being taken,<br/>
although the scheme still had many supporters, until M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">de </span>Lesseps<br/>
directed his attention to the matter. It was reserved for this shrewd<br/>
and energetic Frenchman to carry out the task which had seemed<br/>
impracticable to a series of wealthy and powerful princes. In 1831<br/>
he was sent from Tunis to Egypt as a young consular <span style="color: #0000FF;">Weve</span>. At<br/>
Alexandria, where he had to perform quarantine for a considerable<br/>
time, he was supplied with books <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">M. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mimaut</span>, the French <span style="color: #0000FF;">consul</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Among them was <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rre</span>'s MÃ©moire regarding the scheme of<br/>
connecting the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">seas</span>, which led him to consider its great importance, although <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sre </span>himself doubted its feasibility. In 1838<br/>
he made the acquaintance of Lieut. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Waghorn</span>, an Englishman<br/>
(p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">419</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, whose zealous advocacy of the construction of a route<br/>
between Europe and India via Egypt stimulated his zeal for a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sim<br/>
