Beyond Talkha the train runs at a little distance to the W. of the
Damietta arm, and next reaches (511/2 M.) Semmenfid, an
uninteresting little town, consisting of a densely packed mass of
low mud--hovels (no inn). The ruins of the ancient Sebennytus,
the site of which is now occupied by Semmenfid, are also insignificant. The old Egyptian name of Sebennytus was Teb- -cn- mater
which the cuneiform inscriptions render Zalmuti Ccoptiesyerrmouti
and Sebennetu). It was the capital of the home of Sehennytes
