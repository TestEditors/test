, series of facts and traditions, and are entirely deficient in method
and the faculty of criticism. The following are the most important
writers on the general history of Egypt: ], of Mossul in Syria; Ibn Mama Â»

which was printed at Bulali, in four volumes, in 1868; Abutfidt't
(d. 1331), prince of llama in Syria. The following are authors of
important works on limited epochs of Egyptian history and of
valuable descriptive works :--I'll-Malaria id- [ 1142, at Cairo), the
author of a geographical, physical, historical, and political description of Egypt, and of Cairo in particular, printed at 11015115 in
