spacious vault excavated on one side of it, and there plated in
such a pOsition that its face is turned towards lichen. The entrance
to the lateral vault is then walled up, and during this long process
the mourners recite the word -'AIM/ut muyh/ir ct-muslimfn
wir-muslim-it, el-mftmintn waT-miimimtt' (God pardons the Husli in
men and the Muslim women, the faithful men and the faithful
women). A lilmtib, imam, or other person then addresses a few
stereotyped words to the deceased. informing him how he is to
answer the two examining angels who are to question him during
the ensuing night (p. Ici). A fitha having again been whispered,
and the perpendicular shaft filled up, while the mourners incessantly
repeat the words - fbismithih er-ralmair raltmitni' (in the name
of God, the merciful), the bystanders shake hands, and the male
mourners disperse. The women, however, who have stood a little
on one side during the ceremony, now come forward and inspect
the tomb.

Another custom peculiar to the Muslims is that the separation
of the sexes is as strict after death as during life. In family vaults
one side is set apart for the men, the other for the women exclusively. lletween these vaults is the entrance to the tomb, which is
usually covered with a single large slab. The vaults are high enough
to admit of the deceased sitting upright in them when he is being
examined by the angels Munkar and Nekir on the first night after
his interment (see p. 155); for, according to the belief of the Mohammedans, the soul of the departed remains with his body for
a night after his burial. For particulars regarding the tombs, see
p. lei).
