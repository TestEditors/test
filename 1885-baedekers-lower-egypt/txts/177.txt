he marriage-contract is now complete. Before the wedding the
bride is conducted in gala attire and with great ceremony to the
bath. This procession is called We/ret cl ytrrnvrrfrrt'. It is headed
by several musicians with hautbois and drums; these are followed
by several married friends and relations of the bride in pairs, and
after these come a number of young girls. The bride is entirely concealed by the clothing she wears, being usually enveloped from head
to foot in a cashmere shawl, and wearing on her head a small cap, or
crown, of pasteboard. The procession moves very slowly, and another
body of musicians brings up the rear. The hideous shrieks of joy
which women of the lower classes utter on the occurrence of any sensational event are called sagltfrft. The bride is afterwards conducted
with the same formalities to the house of her husband.

The ceremonies observed at funerals are not less remarkable
than those which attend weddings. If the death occurs in the morning, the funeral takes place the same day; but if in the evening,
it is postponed till next day. The body is washed and mourned
over by the family and the professional mourning women (neddfihalls; a custom prohibited by Mohammed, but one dating from the

boys usually chant in a loud and shrill voice several passages from
the'Hashriych', a poem describing the last judgment. The bier,
with the head of the deceased foremost, comes next, being borne
by three or four of his friends, who are relieved from time to time
by others. After the bier come the relations and friends in their
everyday attire, and the female relatives, with dishevelled hair,
sobbing aloud, and frequently accompanied by professional mourning women, whose business it is to extol the merits of the deceased.
If the deceased was the husband or father of the family. one of the
cries is -'O thou camel of my house', the camel being the emblem
of the bread-winner of the household.

The body is first carried into that mosque for whose patron
