The Vestibule (1) of the b'. facade, through which we reach

801 (pomp. p. 279). Adjoining the tomb is a column, said to
represent the height of the deceased, and inscribed with several
biographical data. A black stone here (ironstone), when rubbed
on granite under water, is believed by the Muslims to communicate
sanatory properties to the discolourcd water.

The adjacent tomb is that of Sultan Foray, son of liarlgulg.

Fm'ag (1399-1-112) hail scarcely ascended the throne (20th June, 1399),
as a boy of thirteen years of age, before the (139111112) smans began to threaten the
Syrian dominions of the Egyptian empire; and Timur (Tamerlane), in his
war against the Osmans, shortly afterwards defeated the Syrian emirs, who
had opposed him, near Aleppo. Farag himself thereupon headed a campaign against Timur, and proceeded Victoriously as far as Damascus; but
owing to dissensions among his emirs he was obliged to return to Cairo
and leave h' vis to its fate. After the defeat of the Turks under Baie d
by the Mongols under Timur at the battle of Angora, Farag was compelled to enter into negotiations with Timur, and he is even said to
have sent him Egyptian coins hearing the Mongolian conqueror's name
in token of his subjection. The death of Timur, however (18th Dec.
1103), saved Egypt from the risk of being conquered by the Mongols.
The latter years of Farag's reign were constantly disturbed by the rebellions of his emirs, particularly Sh√©kh el-Mahmddi Muaiyad (see p. 273).
He was at length compelled by the insurgents to capitnlate at Damascus,
whither he had proceeded with his army, and was executed (May, 11121.

reigned seventy days only. The S. Mausoleum (PI. 13) contains
the tombs of the female members of the family. The *Mambar

specimens of Arabian sculpture, was presented by Kait Bey

balconies below them), are borne by pendent roruices.

The symmetrical plan of the edifice, its massive masonry, and
the symmetrical disposition of the rows of pilasters with domes,
constitute this mosque one of the most perfect examples ofArabian
architecture in existence; and, notwithstanding its ruinous condition, it still presents a most imposing appearance.
