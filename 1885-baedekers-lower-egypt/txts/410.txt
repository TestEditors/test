360 Route J. THE PYRAMIDS OF GIZEH. Environs

Pyramid. This chamber is hewn in the rock, and roofed with painted



hex of limestone leaning against each other at the same angle as that
formed by the sides of the Pyramid. It is 221/2 ft. in height, 461/2 it. in
length from E. to "K, and 161/3 ft. in width from N. to S. llelzoni here
fond a granite sarcophagus let into the ground and filled with rubbish,
31!. in height, G ft. 7in. in length, and awn. in width, and destitute of
inscription. The lid was broken. The lower passage, entered from the
paVement on the N. side of the Pyramid, descends at first at an angle of
21° My, reaches a trap-door, runs in a horizontal direction for 59 n, and
then ascends, terminating, after a distance of 97 n. in all, in the horiznutill corridor leading to Belzoni's Chamber. (in the E. side of the
middle of the horizontal portion of this lower passage was introduced a
small chamber; and. connected with it on the W. side by means of a descending passage, 22 ft. in length. was another chamber hewn in the rock,
8 ft. 5in. in height, 31 ft. 3 in. in length. and 10 ft, tin. in width. The
perpendicular height of this Pyramid is now 450 ft. (formerly 458 ftJ,
each side of the base measures (5941/2 ft. (originally 7113/4 ft.), and the
height of each sloping side is 5663/4 ft. (originally 5753/; it), while the
sides rise at an angle of 52" 20'. The solid content of the masonry is
now 2,156,960 cubic l s, equivalent to d833.000 tons in weight (originally 2,496,710 cub. t 5., equivalent to 5,309,000 tons).

The Third Pyramid, named by the Egyptians (i) her,

or'the upper', was erected by Menkaura, the Mykerinos of Herodotus. The rock on which it stands has a shelving surface, and
the necessary horizontal site was formed by building up a pedestal of enormous blocks, instead of by removing a portion of the
rock The stones of which the Pyramid is constructed are remarkably large and well hewn. The lower part of it is covered with
slabs ofpolished granite, and the upper part with rough stones. The
inernstation and the material which once filled the angles of the
exterior are now so damaged that the tiers of the internal nucleus
are almost everywhere visible. On the E. side are relics of a temple
(comp. p. 358). With regard to the construction of the Third Pyramid and the attempts which have been made to destroy it, see
pp. 340, 347, 353.

The Interior of the Third Pyramid is in many respects particularly
interesting, and the access to it was formerly easier than that to the
Pyramid of Cheops, but the indolent Beduins have unfortunately allowed
it to become choked with sand. The entrance is on the N. side, 13 ft.
above the ground. A passage ac dementia at an angle of 26° 2' to a distance of 1011/2 ft., being lined with granite where it passes through the
masonry from a to b, and then penetrating the solid rock from b to c.
From c a slightly descending passage cd leads to a white-washed antechambcrf, ft. in height, 12 ft. in length, and 10 ft. in width, and,
beyond this chamber, passes three trap-doors g, which were intended to
arrest the progress of intruders. The passage lid then becomes nearly
horizontal (gradient 4°) for a distance of 1111/2 ft., and finally descends to
the chamber e, which is "1/2 ft. long, 121/: ft. broad, and owing to the
unevenness of the rock from which the pavement has been removed,
varies from 13 ft. to 13 ft. Sin. in height. The remains of a sarcophagus
let into the ground were found here, but not that of Menkaura, which
was carefully ensconced in a still lower tomb--chamber.'
