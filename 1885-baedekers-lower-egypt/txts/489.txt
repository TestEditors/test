The great mercantile importance of the Canal is apparent from the
following data. The distance from London to-Bombay vig the Cape of
Good Hope is 12,518 English miles, and via the Suez Canal 7028 M. only.
The saving thus effected is "per cent of the distance. From Hamburg

The traffic" on the Canal is rapidly increasing, as appears from the
following statistics. and many vessels (not exceeding 125 ft. in length)
pass through it at regular intervals.

In 1870. 11865 vessels of an aggregate burden of 103. 911 toy.

In 1883 the British vessels which passed through the Canal were
2537' 1n number, French 272 Dutch 121, German 122, Austrian and Hungarian 67, Italian 63, Spanish 31 Russian 18 and there were also a number
of vessels of other nationalities. The number of passengers on board
these vessels was about 115,000.

The net receipts are also "T?"', 0001. _ - 1823'. 26256001.
The fact that the increase in the receipts of the last few years has
not kept pace with that of the tonnage of the vessels is explained by the
reduction of the tariff.

PASSAGE OF THE SUEZ CANAL. The entrance to the Canal from
