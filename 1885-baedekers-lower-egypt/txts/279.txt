erant vendors of different kinds of sweetnieats, which to Europeans
look very uninviting. Thus, sultlub is a thin jelly made of wheatstarch and sugar, the sellers of which shout,
'luzlriweh, yli mklcar birnisrrrO yo lmmweh! 7
(confection, o sugar, for a nail, 0 confeotiou I). These vendors, who resemble the
rag and bone collectors of European towns,
often barter their wares for nails or pieces
of old iron, as their call indicates. Lastly,
there are itinerant cooks, with portable kitchens, who sell small meat puddings, fish,
and other comestibles, and whose customers
eat their dinners sitting cross-legged by
the side of the street. This custom is noticed by the old German geographer Sebastian Minister (d. 1559), who says that
'the city of Cairo is said to be five times
as large as Paris. There are fewpeople, who,
as with us, buy food to prepare at home; but
when they are hungry they buy from the
cooks, of whom the city contains nearly thirty thousand".

The way in which fruit and vegetables are cried is particularly
curious. The commonest expressions are perhaps the following;
'rUU5h ychmuurinhah yd LE"tptn' ('God will make them
light, o lemons'; i. e., he
will make light, or empty
the baskets containing the
lemons); "asubyt1 burtulyln,
'asal' ('honey, 0 oranges,
honey'; i.e., sweet as honey);'meded yd maltlr'i
bunei cl-baln" ('help! 0
Embabch, help I the lupins
of Embibeh are better than
almonds; Oh, how sweet is
the little son of the river C).
The best lupins are grown
at Embabeh, and they are
called'children of the river"
from the fact that they require to be soaked in Nile water for a considerable time before
they are boiled. Other cries are'er nmselli" l-glzulbdn ya libb'
('0 comforter of those in distress, kernels", i, e., of the melon);
or, more commonly,'ermoyarnrnm.s' Croasted kernels");'yz'i fustulc
