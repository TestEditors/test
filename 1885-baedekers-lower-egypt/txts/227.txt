1. Alexandria.

Arrival. The perfectly flat NE. coast of Egypt, and even Alexandria
itself, are not visible to the steamboat passenger until very shortly before the vessel enters the harbour. We first observe the lighthouse rising conspicuously above the flat and colourless line of the coast, and
then a row of Windmills, light--coloured buildings. and the smoke of the
steamboats in the harbour. On a hill to the left rises the chateau of the
Khedive at Ramleh (p. 222), and on the coast, to the right, at the beginning of the entrance to the harbour, we perceive the so-called Bdb
et-tArab (Beduin Gate), the extremity ofa line of fortifications extending
between the sea and Lake 11areotis u 223). It was this western harbour
only, the Eunostos, or harbour of those'returning home in safety" of
the Greeks, that European vessels were formerly permitted to enter,
while they were rigorously excluded from the'Great Harbour' on the
E. side, which was described by Strabo (p. 208), and is now erroneously called the'New Harbour". The latter, which Mohammed rAli
attempted again to utilise, but found too much choked up with sand, is
now chiefly used by fishing-boats. but larger vessels sometimes enter it
when compelled by stress of weather.

Before passing Biib el-'Arah the steamer takes a pilot on board and
is steered by him through a narrow, shallow, and rocky channel (13697702,)
into the harbour. As the passage can only be effected by daylight,
vessels arriving in the evening must ride at anchor outside until next
morning. 0!: the coast, to the right, we observe the grotesque thfr
ruined Chruetta 0f Meks (p. 221), with its numerous domes and slender
towers. It was erected by the viceroy Sa'id Pasha (p. 1071, who used to
