each nome possessed its own local divinity and colleges of priests,
and invented its own cosmological and metaphysical allegories.
This accounts for the differences of doctrine in a number of forms
of worship bearing the same name, and for the frequency with
which the attributes of one god trench on those of another. The
primitive religion, moreover, underwent great changes as the capacity ofthe hierarchy for more profound speculation increased, until
at length the relations of the divinities to each other and to the
fundamental ideas represented grew into a complicated system,
understood by the limited circle of the initiated alone. This was
styled the lisoruuic Docrnmni, the leading idea of which was,
