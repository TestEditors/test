To the S. of the last is the Saint el--G'funi' (PI. 10), or Anterior
Court. 01111105011 by vaulted galleries, in the upper parts of which
plain limestone has been used instead of alabaster. In the centre
is the Ilanefiyeh (p. 184 ], designed in the debased Turkish style.
On the W. side is the approach to a tower, terminating in pavilions
in the Chinese style, and containing a clock which was presented
to Mohammed'Ali by Louis Philippe of France.

A magnificent "" 5me is obtained from the parapet at the S w.
od of the mosque, which is reached by walking round the building.
(The palace of the Khedive, fitted up in the European style, is
uninteresting.) From this point we survey the yellowish grey city,
with its countless minarets, domes, and gardens. At our feet stands
the mosque of Sultan liasan. To the N. and W. are the windmill..
hills? and the green plain traversed by the P. To the W. in
the distance are the Pyramids, towering above the desert. On the
flat roofs of the houses we observe innumerable air-pipes, called
mall5af, known also by the Persian name of badgir, by means of
which the cool north-wind is introduced into the houses.

The other mosques in the citadel cannot be visited without special
permission (p. 241). Many of the chambers have been diverted from their
original uses, so that they are not easily inspected, and are moreover in
a very ruinous condition.

The Gtimir tia1tilteddin Yi1suf (1'1. 60 ], situated to the SE. of the
Masque of Jlnhammed'Ali, was erected in A. D. 1171-98, in a style betraying the influence of Western architecture, and in many points resembling
that of a basilica. Here, too, the pointed arch predominates. The openings
under the arcades are of the elongated Moorish form. The dome was
once supported by nine magnificent columns of granite, but it 11.11 now
fallen in. the only remains of it being the deeplysenlptnred pendentivcs, As
in the case of most of the other mosques. the columns have been taken
from ancient monuments. The 11111111 is handsomely embellished with
miniature arcades, in the interior ot'which are rich arabesques. The cotl'ered
ceiling of carved wood is painted white and gilded, with a blue ground.
The 1111111111111 1111 still partly filled with tracery in plaster. The whole
edifice up to the roof is of solid masonry. The minarets, each consisting of a cube with a cylinder above it, are covered at the top with
slabs of green porcelain, and are encircled with a band of'Snllus' characters
in white on a brown ground.

Immediately to the 3.11 of the Mosque of Saladin is the so-called
Well of Joseph (111.27), a square shaft, sunk in the limestone rock to a
depth of 21% containing somewhat brackish water, which is brought
to the surface by 111e.11111 Jr" Iwo 521111 e111, one above the other, worked by
oxen halfway down the opening. Since the introduction of the stem1111111111 fy. 2 II, however, the well 11.1.1 lost its former importance. When
the citadel was constructed here in the th cent, thelluilders discovered
an ancient shaft filled with sand, which ifi'rtldheddiu Yfisuf caused to be reopened and named after himself Ydsuf's. or Joseph's, Well. This circumstance gave rise to the tradition, which was cLielly current among
the Jews. that this was the well into which the Joseph of scripture was
put by his brethren, and the story is Mill faithfully repealed hy the dragomans.

The Gami' Sul√©man Pasha (1'1. [ 171 was erected 111 11111 "re still chiefly used and the windmills have
comparatively little to do.
