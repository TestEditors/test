overgrown with seeds and marsh-plants. The distance to be traversed depends on the state of the water, and the route varies at
different seasons. The villages resemble those 011 the Upper Nile,
except that there are no large dovecots here. About noon we reach
the margin of the desert, on the parched and cracked surface of
which there are occasional pools of salt water. Towards sunset we
regain the cultivated land, and, after a good deal of waiting and
shouting, are ferried across the 111111: Canal. We then either pitch
our tent among the ruins of the ancient Tanis, or ask hospitality
of Ahmed, the wealthy farmer of the fishings. His son Mustafa
will be found obliging. Insect-powder should not be forgotten.

a voyage or 15-35 hrs., according to the wind. No fixed fare. On the
island of Tents are the ruins of the ancient Tennis, most of which appear
to date from the time of the Crusades. The ruins on several other islands
indicate that a great part of the lake was once cultivated land, sprinkled
with towns (p. 435). We at length quit the lake and enter the Nur izz
Canal (9. 438), the ancient Tanitic arm of the bile, and in 1-2 hrs. more
we disembark opposite to 5111.

takes place every Tuesday and l riday at the house of Ahmed. The
faces and figures of the inhabitants are peculiar. They are doubtless
the descendants of the wild and rebellious Bashmurites and Biamites who gave so much trouble to the troops of the khalifs Merwan 11. [ 744-50 ] and Maru" (813-33), and also of the Semitic
shepherds who inhabited the Menzaleh region at a very remote period. They were called Arms, or, with the article, Pi-Amu, by the
Egyptians, and the name was afterwards corrupted to liiamites.
They were also known as Pi-Shemer, which was corrupted to
Bashmurites. In the Christian period they belonged to the orthodox
church, and styled themselves Melekites, or'royalists', a name
which they still apply to themselves in the form'Malakiyin',
although they have long since embraced El-Jslinn. The hope of
