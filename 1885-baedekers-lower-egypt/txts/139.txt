becomes very predominant: i. e., a number of symbols are used to
stand for the first letter only of the word they represent. Thus the

syllabic symbol j 557 C'the prince') is used for the letter 3 alone;

% nehem ('the lotus-bud') for n alone; and so on.

The frames within which the groups of hieroglyphies are 011closed CCD are termed'cartonches'. Where they occur, the inscription generally records the names of kings, and occasionally,
butvery rarely, those ofgods. Above them usually stands the group

;% sulm sekhet, i. e.'king of Upper and Lower Egypt', or
D a

:7



nab taui, sovereign of both lands' or :7 m nab khu---- u,

'lord of the diadems'.

When the name of a king is to he deciphered, the alphabetical
signs must first be noted, and then the syllabic symbols. The following examples will illustrate this.

The builder of the great pyramids is named

Khafra. Here 0 is the 3rd syllabic sign m, the 4--th syllabie sign khu; KL the letter /' This could give us rt-KM-f;
but it is to be read KM-f-ro, or Khafra, as the syllable ra, whereever it occurs in the name of a king, is always placed first without
regard to its proper place in the structure of the word. This was
done out of respect for the holy name of Ra, the god of the sun,
to which the Egyptians thus pionsly gave precedence. On the same
principle the name of the builder of the Third Pyramid, C) (5), or Tu-nun- -Im is to be read Menkara or
Menkera.- Several celebrated kings' of the 18th Dynasty are termed

S E m n. New E is the 14th syllabic sign telmti or
a "a "

11mm the 15th syllabic sign mas, and n the 18th alphabetical

letter, which is added as a phonetic complement to mes. The name
is therefore to be read Taliut-mes or Ty itt-rno, the Greek form of
which was Tuthmosis (commonly known as Thothmes).
