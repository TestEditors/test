336 Route J. MOliATTAM. Environs,

The WVinw from this point, especially with its sunset colouring, is magnificent. The thousand minarets of the city and the
picturesque buildings of the Citadel are then tinted with a delicate
rosy hue. The grandest of all the burial-grounds of the desert forms
a noble foreground, the venerable Nile dotted with its lateen sails
flows below us in its quiet majesty, and to the W., on the borders
of the immeasurable desert, tower the huge and wondrous old Pyramids, gilded and reddened by the setting sun. At our feet are
the Citadel with the mosque of Mohammed'Ali, the old aqueduct
on theleft, andthe domes of Imam Shelfe'i (p. 327 ]. On a rocky eminence are situated the picturesque ruins of several burial-mosques,
which, being of the same 0010111 as the rock, are apt to escape the
notice of travellers on the Nile or its banks.

The Nohattam and the adjacent hills which tlzmk the valley of the
Nile, belong to the great range of the nnmmulite mountains which extend from NJV. Africa, across Egypt and India, to China. This nummulite formation is one of the Eocene, "oldest deposits of the tertiary
period, and immediately 1111111115 me chalk. It is remarkably rich in
fossils. the chief mass of which consists of millions of nummulites ia kind
of snail-shell), or large rhizopodes of the polythalmniea group. The tar Â»
ger kinds are about one inch in diameter, and the susaller ahout 1/1 111111
On removing the outer coating of limestone, we 111111 1110 well-defined
chambers within. They are also frequently seen, out into two halves, in
the stones of the Pyramids, which are to a great extent 01111511115110.11 of
nummulite limestone. The Greeks also noticed these curious fossils, and
Herodotus mentions the smallest kinds as being petrified lentils, of the
sort eaten by the ancient Egyptians (comp. 333).

The numerous quarries in the slopes of the Mohatturn and the higher
side-valleys of the range also yield a profusion of sea-urchins (clypeaster,
eidaris, 1111111111 kiudh 111 oysiturs, ceritliiuru, 11111111,
struntlurs, furritella, nautilus, bivalves,'sharks' teeth, and bones
of the halicore. Beautiful crystals of isinglass-sbme, and of strontium also
occur, the shells of the nummulites having frequently been crystallised
into the latter mineral.

At the N. end of the plateau is an old Turkish fort, whence a
bridge descends to the Citadel, but travellers are not permitted to
use this route. On the E. and higher part of the Molyattani, to the
right, adjoining the summit, is a tlagstatf erected in 1574 by the
English party of scientific men who observed the transit of Venus
from this point. The S. (right) end of these hills is skirted by the
road to the smaller Petrified Forest, which may be reached from
this point in about% hour.

away from the lofty perpendicular sides of the ahove-mentioned
quarry. The route back to the town vial the Citadel turns to the
