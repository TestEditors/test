emerald, which is frequently mentioned by ancient authors was a green
paste coloured with copper, which, when ground, yielded the best green
paint. This raw material was used by the Egyptians for colouring glass,
of which many pieces are preserved, and was probably the malachite which
is called by Theophrastus'false emerald', or copper green; and which,
being much used for soldering gold, was named'chrysocolla' .--- The inscriptions always mention mafkat with khesbet, AS. lapis lazuli (either
genuine, inferior, or artificial), as the two minerals which are generally
found together, principally in association with copper ores, malachite
being carbonate of copper with a certain proportion of water, while lapis
lazuli sometimes occurs interspersed with malachite, and sometimes in
small nodules by itself. In the Mriidi Maghiira copper was formerly
worked, and along with it was doubtless found malachite, which was
either used as a precious stone, or manufactured into paint, The district



















was called the Mafkat (malachite) region, after the most precious mineral
obtained in it. The miners were condemned criminals, particularly
political offenders and prisoners of war. The relations also of the
prisoners were frequently condemned to the mines and compelled to
work in fetters. As, at a later period, the Christians were compelled to
work in the porphyry quarries, so in the reign of Ramses H. tho
refractory Israelites were employed in the mines.

Ulamhering up the rugged slope of the hill from the entrance
to the mines, and passing several shafts, we reach a number of
figures engraved on the rock, discovered by Prof. Palmer, and consisting of the hawk, the bird sacred to Horus, five human forms, and
someillegiblohicroglyphies. The first figure, now almost obliterated,
seems to hold a chisel in its left hand, and may represent a miner;
