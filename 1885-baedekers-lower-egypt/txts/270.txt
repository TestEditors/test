(p. 262), with *View of Cairo, and visit to the Gami' Mohammed
'Ali; Gamir Sultan Hasan (p. 260); Ghmir ihn Tnliin (p. 265);

kattam (view of Cairo by sunset), and past the Citadel (p. 336).

FOURTH DAY. Forenoon: Mosques of El-Azhar (p. 287) and
liasanén (p. 292), most conveniently visited in succession, as both
are shown by special permission only, and with the escort of a
hawwas. The same remark applies to the Gimie eeiyideh Zéuab
(p. 268), a visit to which, however, had perhaps better be omitted,
as its cituation is somewhat remote. The mosque of lEl-Azhar
should not be visited on a Friday, as there is no teaching on that
day, and the traveller would thus miss one of the chief attractions.
