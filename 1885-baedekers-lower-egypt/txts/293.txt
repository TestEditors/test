i'Gami' Mohammed rAli (PI. 53), the'Alabaster Mosque', whose
lofty and graceful minarets are so conspicuous from a distance as
to form one of the landmarks of Cairo. The building was begun by Mohammed "Ali, the founder of the present Egyptian dynasty, on the site of a palace which was blown up ill 1824; and
in 1857 it was partly
completed in its present
form by Sa'id Pasha (p.
107). In plan it resembles the Turkish
mosques built on the
model of the Hagia Sofia
at Constantinople. The
execution of the design
displays but little artistic taste, and the
treatment of the material is somewhat unsatisfactory. The alabaster used for the incrustation of the masonry consists partly of
blocks, and partly of
slabs, and was obtained
from the quarries near
Beni Snef, which were
known in ancient times,
but had long been disused and forgotten. The
beautiful yellow tint
of the stone soon fades
when exposed to the "3 p 1;,
