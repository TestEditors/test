During the Amman and Turkish regime the waters of the lake
gradually subsided, but in 1901, during the siege of Alexandria, the
English cut through the neck of land between the lake and the sea near
the so-called Naison Carr√©e, a little to the \V. of Ahukir, thus laying an
extensive and fertile region under water and destroying about 150 villages. The present E Sett marks the spot where the fatal cutting was
made and afterwards closed. Muhammed mi did all in his power to
repair the damage and to improve the environs of Alexandria, but about
00,000 acres of cultivable land are said still to he covered by the Seawater. The water is now evaporated for the sake of its salt, the right
to manufacture which is farmed out by government for 4000 purses
(nearly mum.) per annum.

Arabian cemetery lies close to the railway. In July, 1798, llonaparte, on his expedition to Cairo, selected the route vii Hamanhtor,
which at the time was so excessively parched and burned up that
his officers and men suffered terribly, while he himself narrowly
escaped being taken prisoner. On letJnly, however. he succeeded
in defeating the troops of the Mamelukes at the' tattle of the Pyramids', and on the 20th he entered Cairo. In Now, 1802, the
Mamelnkes here inflicted a signal defeat on the Turks. A large
