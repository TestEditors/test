A'l'ocn'rnnot'cn THE Farfin, includng a visit to the Labyrinth, the
site of Lake Morris, the Birket el--KIm'tn with its abundant Wildfowl,
and the ruins in its neighbourhood, takes 6 8 days, and requires a tent,
a dragonian, and a supply of provisions.A dragoman charges 31110111 day for each person, according to the requirements of his employers,
and for that sum he is hound to provide them with a tent, provisions
(wine excepted), and donkeys, or other means of conveyance, and to
pay railway fares and all other expenses. A written contract (comp.
p.471), specifying the places to be visited, the points where some stay is to
be made (on which occasions a reduced charge per day should be stipulated
for), and other particulars. should be drawn up before starting. Those
who intend to visit Medinet el-Faytiin and its immediate environs only,
and who do not object to rough quarters for one or two nights, may
dispense with a dragoman and a tent, but should he provided with a
moderate supply of food. An introduction to the mudir will be of great
service in enabling the traveller to procure the necessary horses or donkeys,
which the inhabitants are often unwilling to hire (comp, p, 1158)

undertaken from Cairo, but it may also be combined with a visit tn
