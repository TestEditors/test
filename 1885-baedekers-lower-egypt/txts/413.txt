small figure of a
recumbent lion, facing the Sphinx, in
the middle. In the
background rose a
pillar, and at the

relics are now preserved in the British Museum. The
Sphinx was also
entirely excavated by M. Mariette.

line with the Pyramid of that king, it was not unnaturally thought
that he was the founder of both monuments. This conjecture
seemed to be confirmed by the discovery of the statue of Ohephren
