Two main routes lead to the oasis of Siwah. One, beginning at Alexandria, leads to the W. along the Mediterranean coast rid the idealist
esclS'ooké'r (Katabathmus Parvus) co mans near Barman (the ancient Parwtonium), in 80-90 he's, travel spread over 10-11 days, and there turning
to the S. reaches Siwah in 5 days or 62 hrs. more. This was Alexander
the Grant's route, and was also taken by Browne (see above) in 1792. Or
the traveller may follow the Mediterranean coast for a days more to the
idiabet el-Kebir (Katabathrnus Major) near Bir cum. and there turnin F,
reach Siwah in 5 days or fri hm more. This was Minuteli's route in 820.
The second main route, starting from 12mm or from Cam. man via
the Natron Convents to Siwah, in about 13 days (Homemun 1758), while
the first mate takes 15-20 days. One route is usually taken for the
journey out, the other for the return. Fr. Cailliaud reached saw }; in 1819
from the Faydm in 16 days, vii Rages », tl-Perm, and el-Karah, but the
hostile natives permitted him to pay but one visit to the monuments. In
the following year (1820) Mohammad rAll despatched a military force with
artillery, which reduced the hitherto independent Siwah under the anthem
city of the probe of Egypt. Droeetti and Ricct accom noted this expedition,
Gerhard Rows m: twice mum the oasis; in 188 on his journey from
Tripoli to Alexandria; and in Feb. 1874 in the course of an expedition
undertaken along with Jordan, Zittel, and darkened, at the expense of Ir
ma" n Pasha. This expedition Martin from Assidt proceeded rid Fordfmh
and hal, then struck W. to 2704, where they turned to the N, reaching Small in "days. The return was made via Farifrnh, Dakhel, and
etthdrgeh to the Nile. Unfortunately this costly expedition had not secured the services of an Egyptologist, and even their photographer Ro,
melé wan left behind at dehel, so that it has contributed little or nothing
to our knowledge of the inscriptions at Siwah. We have on the other hand
very full information concernin the temples at er-Kurs) from Cailtiaud,
Root. Hay, and H. Bronson (187 y, to which also the photographs taken by
M. Remelé at dehel and Khdrgeb have largely added. The inhabitants
of the oasis of Siwah speak a peculiar dialect, of which Minutoli has
communicated 400 words. Herodotus (H, 42) mentions that the Ammonites are colonists from Egypt and Ethiopia and speak a dialect midway
between the languages of these lands. They understand a little Arabic,
but their own speech is a dialect of Tamasirht, a Berber tongue, under.

The deity worshipped in the temple of the oasis was a ram's-headed
and ram's-horned Amman, such as appears on some Theban monoments
(an. the N. wall of Medinet Hahn), and also on coins of the Ptolemies.
