consists of 41 steps hewn in the rock, with a massive balustrade
on each side. The temple was constructed under Ptolemy IX,
Euergetes II. (Physkon), and subsequently provided with new inscriptions by Ptolemy X. Soter H. The site was regarded as holy
even before the building was erected, as we are informed by an inscription of the reign of Ramses VL, cut in the rock on the E. side
