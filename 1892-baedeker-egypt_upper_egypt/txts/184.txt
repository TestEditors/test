and sometimes scratching out older names. On the capitals the
cartouches of Ramses H. or of his more immediate successors are

By far the most important place among the gods here is filled
by Amman, Math, and Khunsu, the Theban triad (Vol. L, p.138).
At Karnak Amman was conceived of in two capacities, which must
be distinguished from each other; he was in the first place Amman
Generator, in the second place Ammon-IG, the king of the gods.
Amman may be identified by his feather-crown, Khuusu by the
crescent on his head and the lock on his temples, and Math by the
vulture-weep. The other gods that appear with them may be easily
identified with the help of the introduction on the Religion of
Ancient Egypt (Vol. L, p. 124). On the architrave are some clearly
cut inscription, of which a few deviate from the usual formulae.
One of these, dating from Seti L, on the architrave above the budcolumns in the first crossurow to the E. (right), is as follows: We

an archer of a mighty arm and like the (god of war) Menu: & great
wall of brass. He is the protector of his soldiers, when they thirst
in the hollow way, on the day of battle. No opposition is offered
to him from the hundred thousand brave hearts that are united in
one place'. In the inscriptions the king usually boasts of having
erected an eternal and magnificent building in the house of his
father Ammon, of founding festivals, or of offering great treasures.
