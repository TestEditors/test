night, on the left (N.) the twelve hours of the day, each with their
eponymous divinities

The interior hand on the W. side exhibits three designs referring to the moon which is here represented as'ara', eye

In the first are the 14 days of the waning moon, in the second this
"days of the waxing moon represented by "divinities ascending
a flight of steps, while the victorious Thoth appears as a fifteenth
divinity beyond the moon-disc. Finally appears Osiris as the moongod, seated with Isis and Nephthys in a boat, floating above the
symbol of the sky m, which is supported by four female forms .-In the E. section the interior hand exhibits the course of the sundisc through the 12 hours of the day, represented by 12 boats. In
each disc appears the figure of the divinity to which the particular
hour was sacred.

On the W. side of the hall, between the second and third row
of columns (to the right of the entrance), and on the E side between the third and fourth row (on the left) are SidcwEntmnces

ball, when the lofty double doors were thrown

(p. 88), the cartouches of the kings in all

empty. In Room an the accompanying royal
