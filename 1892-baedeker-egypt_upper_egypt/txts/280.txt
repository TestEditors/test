This tomb originally belonged to an anti-king Siptah and his
wife Tamer, but it was afterwards appropriated by Scti-Nchht,
father and immediate predecessor of Ramses 111., and suppressor
of a rebellion in his kingdom (p. 172). Whether the tomb also
contained the names of Seti 11., who rests in the adjoining tomb,
is exceedingly doubtful; they are not new visible. The queen Tauser
is more conspicuous in the paintings here than her husband, whence
it has been justly inferred that Siptah founded his claim to the
throne on rights vested in his wife.
