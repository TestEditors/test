son of Dionysius, fulfilled a row made to Isis, Serapis, and the
gods worshipped along with them, by presenting to them the worship of his brother Protas and his children, of his brother Niger,
his wife Klidemas, and his children Dionysius and Anabas. On the

Augustus, in whose reign therefore the wall, though furnished with
inscriptions by later emperors, must have existed at least in a rough
state. The other inscriptions are of similar purport.

At the S. and of the E. Colonnade (Pl. D) was a large Hall
(Pi, C), of which only fragments of the N. and E. walls remain.
It bears the name of Tiberius. The colonnade, which adjoins its
N. wall, was never entirely completed. Only three of the capitals
of the columns (including a very fine palm--capital) are finished;
the rest are merely roughly blocked out, but they are of interest as
showing us that the more elaborate carving was not taken in hand
until after the capitals had been placed in position upon the shafts.
The E. colonnade does not extend as far as the first pylons, but is
separated from them by a small Temple of Aheulapius' the Egyptian lmhotep, son of Ptah (Pl. E), consisting of two chambers, and

with his mother and wife, presenting to leis the symbol of a field.
The entire imposing erection is 150 ft. broad and 60 ft. high. The

At each side of the Central Doorway on, b) is a figure of Isis. On
the upper part of the left tower is the Pharaoh sacrificing to Osiris and
