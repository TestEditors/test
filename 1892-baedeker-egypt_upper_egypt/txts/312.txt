battle, is traditionally laid in the name of Apcliinopolis. An inscription relating to the Home myth, on the inside of the W.
girdle-wall, states that'they reached Seth-Typhon and his companions in the name of Apollinopolis'.

Horns emerged victorious from this battle, and the evil Sethu
Typhon was pierced by him (tabu).'Piercer thereupon became his
name, and'place of the piercing' the name of his district and town.
This name is clearly preserved in the modern name Eats, Another name, that occurs most frequently next to this one and has
also reference to the chief deity of the temple at Edfn, is Hot or
Rebut. Thus the winged sun-disc, which was placed over the en Â»

Another name for the winged sunmdiso is Apt, which means
'flying' and'wings'.

At the head of the gods worshipped at Edfu stood, as is apparent from what has already been said,'Horus, who spreads his

Lagidae. The Temple proper, to. the sacred apartments exclusive of the later hypostyle with its 18 columns CPI, E) and of the
fore-court with its 32 columns (Pl. F), as well as of the still later
pylons and girdle-wall, was begun by Ptolemy HI. Eucrgctcr I. in
