to Kermit. KENEH. 5. Route. 73

At the time of the pilgrimage to Mecca { tench presents a very lively
scene, as it is than frequented by large numbers of the participators
in that great religious picnic. The spiritual and material wants of
the pious Hcdjddj are catered for by six spacious mosques, numerous codes-houses, and a large number of places of amusement, among
the attractions of which Egyptian dancing-girls are prominent. For
the rest Keneh differs little in general character from the other
towns of Upper Egypt. The traveller should not fail, however, to
see the most valuable piece of land near Kaneh, which is about one
Feddan (3500 sq.yds.) in area and yields an excellent variety of
potter's clay that has made { tench pottery, like that of Assifit, famous
throughout the country. { tench has a special reputation for its
Kala; (pl. of Kalle), or cool porous water-bottles, and for its Bonds
and Zir, large vessels used in carrying, purifying, and preserving
water. In some of the early Egyptian inscriptions, figures of the
Belles and lit appear as distinctive symbols, in the exact forms in
which they are made to-day. Hundreds of thousands of these clay
vessels are annually exported from Keneh in boats of a primitive
but not unpractical description, constructed for the purpose, in
which they are piled up in pyramidal form, fastened together with
ropes made of the best of the date-palm and attached to rectangular
frames. A trustworthy report flares the number sent away in 1860
at 900,000. Considerable activity is also manifested in the manufacture of kiln-dried pottery, generally either red or black, used for
ehibouk-hetulis, bottles, pitchers, vases, drinking-vessels, aim, of
every size and shape. The almost invariably graceful forms and
tasteful decorations of these utensils may be unreservedly set down
as a bequest from ancient Egypt.
