vi PREFACE.

HEIGHTS above the sea-level and other measurements are
given in English feet or miles.

Though nearly every page of the Handbook has been
compiled from personal observation and experience, and
although the conservative East is not nearly so liable to
changes as the more progressive West, the Editor makes no
claim to absolute accuracy in every detail; and he will feel
indebted to any traveller who, from personal experience,
may be able to indicate errors or omissions in the Handbook.
The same remark applies equally to the PRICES and various
items of expenditure mentioned in the volume. The expense
of a tour is much more directly affected by the circumstances
of the moment and the individuality of the traveller in the
East than in 11, i, though it may here be added that the
arrangements of com. Cook and Gaze (pp. xw, xv), of
which most visitors to Upper Egypt will avail themselves,
offer a comparative immunity against extortion. A carefully
drawn up contract will similarly protect those who prefer to
hire a dhahabiyeh for themselves.
