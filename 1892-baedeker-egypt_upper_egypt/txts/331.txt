according to the second and third canons are the same; but those
of the upper part of the body differ very essentially. The head is larger,
the chest recedes farther, the abdomen is higher. The contours become in general fuller, and abandon that early beautiful simplicity and

by the gods.

Beside the door of the next room, the second in the direction
of the Presses, is a seven-lined Calendar of Festivals. The hall
itself was built by Euergetes H. The third room is the first that
shows Ptolemy WL Phuometor offering homage (cartouche see
