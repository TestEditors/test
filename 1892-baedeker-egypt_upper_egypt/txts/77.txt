The steamers and dhahabiyehs are met at et-Hamrah by donkey
boys with well-saddled donkeys and by sellers of pottery, which
can nowhere in Egypt be obtained better than here. The fine pottery
of health, especially its bottles and pipe-bowls, is justly celebrated
and forms an important article in its export trade, which also deals
in. linen, embroidered leather goods, ostrich feathers and other products of the Sfrddn, natron, soda, and corn. It has, however, lost
part of its commercial importance since the great caravans from W.
Africa have frequented other routes and places. Large trains of
camels still come from Darfdr and Kordofdn, generally encamping
at Bent'Adin (p. 29), 19 M. to the N.W. of Assidt. The vicinity
of Assidt is one of the best-cultivated districts in the valley of the
Nile, the fertile strip between the Libyan and Arabian Mts. here
attaining a width of 12 M. The province of Assifit, the mudir of
which resides here, contains 234 villages with 583,596 inhab. (incl.
the cases of Khdrgch and mad). Near the harbour are several large

town lies about 3/4 M. from the river and is reached from the hat Â»

the town lie the long government buildings. The streets are full
of busy life, especially on Sundays, when the people of the neighbourhood flock into the market. Oriental wares are cheaper in the
bazaars of Assidt than at Cairo, but European goods are dearer. The
better houses are of burned brick, the meaner of sun-dried Nile
bricks. The facades on the street are generally unimposing, but a
glance into one of the courts of the bigger houses will show that

we diverge from the main street at the point where it bends to the
