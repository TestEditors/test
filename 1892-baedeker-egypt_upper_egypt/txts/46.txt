bear the same name. The fapades of the most important of them are
partly uncovered. The street of tombs, which is now accessible, presents the appearance of chill-side covered with masonry, manned with
stucco, and provided with ante-chambers. The mouth of each tomb is
towards the E.; the leaning external walls are generally of Nile bricks,
richly embellished with the linear patterns which afterwards formed the
favourite decoration of the sides of the sarcophagi (which were imitations of the tomtr-ftrpBdeO. The vestibule is in most cases compares

later monuments.

wall of the corridor leading to the tomb~chamber, we see the deceased
in a sitting posture, and on the right wall he is represented standing,
with his wife behind him. Adjacent are men and women presenting
od'erings, as in the mastabas of Ti and Ptahhotep. The flesh-tint of the men
is red, and that of the women pale yellow, and this circumstance, especially in a monument of this early period, is important as tending to

as a determinative symbol. The advanced condition of industrial pursuits, showing that the Egyptians already practised the art in which,

of the dress worn by the women represented on the right side of the

patterns on the borders. He tells us that they were not in the habit of
painting the materials for their dress, but of dipping them in certain
fluids They were coloured with boiling dyes, and came out impressed
with a pattern. Although the boilers contained one colour only, it is
said to have imparted several different tints to the studs dyed in them.
- In order to impart a durable colour to the larger figures represented
here, an entirely unique process was employed. The outlines were engraved on the mug while the surfaces enclosed by them were divided
into deeply incised squares, which were filled with stucco of different
colours, the flesh-tint of the men being red, that of the women yellow,
and the colour of the robes being white, em
