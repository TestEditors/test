required the intervention of the Romans, arose between the two towns,
owing to the facts that the citizens of each had killed and dined on the
sacred animals of the other. Juvenal gives an account of a similar strife

Oxyrrhynchus became so "full of convents that monkish songs were heard
in every quarter". Convent jostles convent all round, forming as it were a

words are:'Next come the Cyncpolitan some and Cvnopolis, where
Anubis is worshipped and dogs are hem sacred and fed with consecrated moat'. Several trough-rite hollow; and clam have been
found here, some of which, in the rocks, are of considerable size;
