The opposite side-door on the right side of the hall, leads to
three connected Rooms (PI, xiii, xiv, and XV), which to a certain
extent form a special enclosed sanctuary, within the large temple.
We see here (1) the small temple (Pl. xv, open in front and somewhat higher than the two preceding rooms, and entered by a portal
between two Hathor columns, approached by seven steps; (2) the
unroofed fore-court (Pl xiv), and (3) the small ante-room (PL xiii),
forming a connecting link between the staircase and Room xxiii as

well as between Halls 0 and B. The name Q I is.
