divided into three apartments. A door leads to the outside from
each side of the first apartment. Behind the temple proper, which
is only 42 n. long, is a small recess hewn in the rock, and adorned
on the outside. The N. and S. outside walls of the temple are also
sculptured.

Beyond Denim: the banks of the Nile become flatter and are

mentioned in the Itinerarium Antonini, 20 Roman miles, i.c. 18
Eng ]. M., above Talmis (Kalabsheh). The sacred name of this

place was Pa Ptah, the House of Ptah. The pylon, of which

Gen and Champollion saw traces in front of the rock-temple, has
disappeared, having been washed away by the stream. The word gerf

cisar means, in fact, a bank washed away by a stream. Several

sphinxes, with small statues of the king, still remain, forming an
avenue from the river-bank to the temple. Next to the pylon was a
Vestibule, built outside the hill, while the temple proper is hewn
in the rock. In this vestibule two columns to the left are still
standing (the two to the right have disappeared), and seven of the
original eight pillars, with somewhat clumsy Osiris-statues. The
last bear on their shoulders the name of Ramses 11., who built this
temple and is the only king mentioned in it. He appears not only
as the founder, but also as one of the deities to be worshipped here.
On the beams of the architrave he is named with both his names as
lord of the festivals like his father Ptah, as the ruler of Egypt
and conqueror of his foes (expressed pictorially). The next room
(45 ft. square), hewn out of the rock, requires artificial light; it
produces a serious and gloomy effect. The ceiling is supported by
six Osiris-pillars, 28 ft. high, representing the king as Osiris, with
the crown on his head, his crossed arms bearing the signs of rule
