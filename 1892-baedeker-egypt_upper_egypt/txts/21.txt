29th Day. Arrival in Cairo.

Holders of Cooks' tickets may break their journey at Lunar or
Aswan either on the way up or the way down (after previous arrangement with Cooks' manager in Cairo), and proceed by a subusequent steamer, if there are vacant berths. The maflusteamers,
usually less crowded than the others, may be used in descending
the stream. In all these deviations from the usual tours, very strict
adherence to the terms of the special arrangement is exacted. Travellers are strongly recommended to time their voyage so as to arrive at Lunar 3-4 days before full moon; for moonlight adds a PP'
mHu charm to a visit to the mine here and at Arenas.

Passengers by steamer should beware of the risk of catching
cold by leaving the windows of their cabin open. They should also
avoid placing themselves too near the edge of the deck; and it is
well to remember (as. when shaving) that the steamers frequently
run aground, especially above Loner. Liability to delay through
this last fact, makes it impossible to be sure of reaching Cairo in
time to make connection with the ocean-steamers.
