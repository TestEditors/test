<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">temple </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">AbnuSimhel</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">3350 </span>To the left is the storming of Katesh,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fortress on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grantee</span>, probably situated on an island near Hume<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Emcee</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Neuter </span>the centre, the king hurries to the fight, with<br/>
bended bow. Above the rearing and spirited horses, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>his chariot<br/>
are the words:'The most excellent horse of his majesty <span style="color: #ff0000;">Miamun<br/>
</span>from the stable of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, the beloved of Ammon'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>within the bent <span style="color: #0000FF;">how </span>the Pharaoh is named the beloved of<br/>
Mentu, god of war. The royal leader overwhelms his <span style="color: #ff0000;">fees </span>with his<br/>
impetuous attack and hurls them with their horses and chariots<br/>
into the stream<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Some of the Egyptians are put to flight, and a<br/>
legion of archers hasten in <span style="color: #0000FF;">climate </span>to the aid of the Pharaoh. Among<br/>
the slain are various noble Aramaic warriors considered worthy of<br/>
being specially mentioned, for their names are inscribed above<br/>
them. One of these was <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khirapasor</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">historiographer </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>prince, whose dead body is represented beside the hind legs of the<br/>
king's horses, between two lines of hieroglyphics. A short <span style="color: #0000FF;">12-line<br/>
</span>inscription in front of the elaborately decorated heads of the king's<br/>
horses (the bridle is surmounted with lion's heads and feathers)<br/>
explains the exact <span style="color: #0000FF;">episode'here </span>depicted. It is the famous scene<br/>
that forms the culminating point of the Epic of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Portions</span>, that Egyptian Iliad, which we have already met with on the pylon at Luxor<br/>
(p. 112) and on the S. wall of the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">p</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">141</span>).<span style="color: #0000FF;">'He </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Emma </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»</span>) halted and encamped to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Katesh</span>. Then <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>pressed<br/>
against the worthless <span style="color: #ff0000;">fee</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta</span>. He was alone and no other<br/>
was with him. He found himself surrounded by 2500 war-chariots,<br/>
etc.' The escape of the king from his imminent danger by the help<br/>
of the gods and his own right arm forms the subject of the epic,<br/>
which has been preserved not only upon the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walk </span>of temples but<br/>
also in <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">papyrus</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">roll</span>. Its chief contents have been given elsewhere<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>112). The relief before us represents this eventful moment in<br/>
the warlike career of Ramses, while a repetition of the same subject<br/>
on the W. side of the second pylon and the inscription on the<br/>
architrave in the second court of the temple, inform us that the<br/>
Ramesseum <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>erected by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Votive </span>Building in<br/>
gratitude for his deliverance out of the hands of 2500 enemies.<br/>
<br/>
To the extreme right, in front of the horses of the king, appears<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>the confused mass of men and horses overthrown by the royal<br/>
hero. Beside three Egyptians who hold an Asiatic head downward,<br/>
is the inscription:'The miserable lord of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khileb </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khahrtron-A1epp0<br/>
</span>His soldiers pull him out of the water into which His Majesty had<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>him'. At the end of the relief the prince of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>is shown<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>his chariot, surrounded by unarmed followers, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">encore</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>panying words:'He stands still beside his <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot-soldiers </span>and cavalry.<br/>
His face turned backwards. He advanced no more into the battle<br/>
from fear of His Majesty, when he had seen His <span style="color: #0000FF;">Majesty</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>---Here as<br/>
