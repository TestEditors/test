<span>258 Route 24. GEBEL SILSILEH. From <span style="color: #ff0000;">mm<br/>
<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Metronome </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">SOUTH </span>are as interesting as those just<br/>
described, from which they are reached in about 1/4 hr. The route<br/>
leads to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">5.</span>, sometimes skirting the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-bank</span>, sometimes <span style="color: #0000FF;">leading </span>through the ancient quarries. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>reach Two Chambers,<br/>
with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">openings </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">facing </span>the river, and recesses at the back. At<br/>
the first are two, and at the second are three unnamed sitting stew<br/>
tues, hewn <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>of the rock. The chambers belonged to <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>111., whose name occurs over the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">along </span>with those<br/>
of Ammon Harmachis and Sebek. The first cave belonged to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">misfit</span>, overseer of <span style="color: #0000FF;">granaries</span>, who is here represented along with his<br/>
wife<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The second, to the N., belonged to the mayor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amulet </span>and his<br/>
wife, and contains a series of figures<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>To the S. occurs the name of<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenhotep </span>H. <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">go</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">n </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">An </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hhcpem</span>; with two small <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
</span>bad preservation on the left, and two others, better preserved, on<br/>
the right. Farther to the S. near the river is a brightly painted <span style="color: #0000FF;">Case</span>,<br/>
with painted ceiling. A relief here depicts <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amonemhat</span>, a high<br/>
priest of Ammon (probably, from his name, under the 12th Dyn.)<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificing </span>to his parents and those of his wife Mimi.<br/>
<br/>
The guides point out large square holes in the lofty rocks as<br/>
having been used to fasten the <span style="color: #0000FF;">above</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mentioned </span>mythical chain of<br/>
Silsileh. Skirting the bushy <span style="color: #0000FF;">river</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bank </span>we presently reach three<br/>
Inscribed Tablets, <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>a picturesque appearance as seen from<br/>
the Nile. Two of them, adorned with concave <span style="color: #0000FF;">cornices </span>and with<br/>
doors, lie close beside each other. The architrave is borne by <span style="color: #0000FF;">sculptured </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bud-columns</span>, the shafts of which represented stems of <span style="color: #0000FF;">plum<br/>
</span>bound together by a band. Both of these brightly painted facades<br/>
act as frames for large <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sum</span>, placed at the back of small chapels<br/>
about 6 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>deep. That to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>(left) was erected by Ramses H.<br/>
in the first year of his reign, that to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>(right) by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenptah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Boat-hi-ma</span>) in his first year. Each is formed of three parts<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At<br/>
the top is the triad to which it was dedicated, next is a Hymn to<br/>
the Nile, and below is a list of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>In the one case the divine<br/>
triad consists of Ammon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Math</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>, the chief triad of<br/>
Upper Egypt. in the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra </span>Harmachis, Ptah, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hopi</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">recallm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ing </span>Lower Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>third, similar <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stole</span>, dating from the 6th year<br/>
of Ramses 111., is to be'seen on an isolated rock to the right. All<br/>
are more or less damaged; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>restoration of the text, which is<br/>
the same on all three, with a few trifling variations, is rendered<br/>
possible by collation.<br/>

L. Stem has published a German <span style="color: #0000FF;">Translation </span>of the corrected <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stale </span>of the first year of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eldest </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ind </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beat<br/>

from this <span style="color: #0000FF;">thrice-repeated </span>Hymn to the Nile, the god to whom Egypt owed<br/>
her very origin, and upon whom she was dependent for the conditions of<br/>
continued existence from year to year. Similar hymns to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">some </span>god<br/>
have come down to us in a papyrus from the hand of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span>, one of the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">meet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">famoue'euthore </span>of the period of the Pharaohs; and these are <span style="color: #0000FF;">clearly<br/>
