they ignorantly confounded forms peculiar to these <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-tombe </span>with<br/>
those represented in the entirely independent field of architecture<br/>
above ground. The connoisseurs and students of Greek art, blinded<br/>
by their love for the object of their study, refused to allow that a<br/>
single feature of Hellenic architecture had arisen anywhere but <span style="color: #ff0000;">on<br/>

and his second masterly essay may be taken as the last word on the<br/>
subject. He shows that the development culminating in the polygonal fluted columns of Benihasan can be traced step by step in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cavern-structures </span>of the Egyptians of the ancient kingdom, and<br/>
the also shows that, though the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>Column of the Greeks is<br/>
