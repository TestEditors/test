ringleted hair in <span style="color: #0000FF;">fillets </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>while those of higher rank wear long robes and<br/>
short cloaks of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">tine-woven</span>, richly patterned cloth, dyed a bright<br/>
blue and red. Their feet are naked but their legs are covered to the<br/>
ankle. Nude slaves, wearing only aprons, appear among them carrying the tribute. Besides costly vessels, <span style="color: #ff0000;">lapiswlasuli</span>, and cornelians,<br/>
they also bring a lion and two splendid light-coloured horses.<br/>

To the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kurnet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Murra'i</span>, and at no great distance, appears<br/>
an extensive temple-group. This bears the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hahn</span>, a<br/>
Christian village which arose around and even within the ancient<br/>
sanctuary as early as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">6th </span>cent, and of which considerable traces<br/>
still remain. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>side <span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">temple</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span>rise heaps of rubbish,<br/>
which we follow in the direction of the river, until we reach the<br/>
main <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade</span>, which fronts the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.E</span>. and is as imposing as it is<br/>
curious. The traveller of experience will at once perceive that<br/>
here we have not to do with a monument erected, like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rama</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">?<br/>
</span>scum, under the influence of a single continuous impulse, but with<br/>
a building begun in early times and not completed until the epoch<br/>
of the Ptolemies. The entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice </span>may be divided into three<br/>
easily distinguished portions. The earliest of these is the small<br/>
oblong temple (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span>N, lying parallel with the N. girdle-wall, and<br/>
founded under the 18th Dynasty. The most recent is the pylon<br/>
(Pl. K) adjoining this, with a beautiful and richly adorned portal,<br/>
seen to <span style="color: #0000FF;">especial </span>advantage by those who approach the temple from<br/>
the plain. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>glance at the capitals of the two large columns rising<br/>
in front of the gateway and at the style of the inscriptions informs<br/>
the expert that this edifice dates from the epoch of the Ptolemies.<br/>
Reserving these for later inspection, we proceed first to the third<br/>
portion, the main temple.<br/>

the previously existing temple of the 18th Dynasty<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Though this<br/>
temple is beautiful and finely proportioned in many of its parts, its<br/>
architect has displayed no skill in incorporating what already existed<br/>
with the new edifice<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The erroneous opinion that the temple of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Habu </span>was a royal palace must be most emphatically <span style="color: #0000FF;">contradicted</span>. It was no more a palace than was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum </span>or any of<br/>
the other buildings in <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>Thebes. It was a Memnonium devoted to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ancestor-worship</span>, and its principal part <span style="color: #ff0000;">wasintended </span>for the worship<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">mouse </span>of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, and to remind posterity of his fame<br/>
and his exploits. The temple served also for the celebration of<br/>
festivals, including a specially important one for <span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">adequate<br/>
