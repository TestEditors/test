the oldest part, dating <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus</span>. We know also that the<br/>
goddess of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>was worshipped by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Blemmyes </span>(p. 302), who<br/>
maintained the custom of human <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices </span>until the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Justin<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nian</span>. After Diocletian, who personally visited the island, had conquered these restless children of the desert, <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>destroyed the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fortifications </span>of Philae, and new temples were erected in which<br/>
priests of the Blemmyes and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Notaries </span>were permitted to offer<br/>
sacrifices to Isis along with the Egyptian priests. And these tribes<br/>
even obtained the right of removing the miraculous image of<br/>
the mighty goddess from the island at certain solemn festivals<br/>
and of retaining it for some time. Even after all Egypt had long<br/>
been <span style="color: #0000FF;">christianized </span>and the Theba'id was crowded with monks, the<br/>
ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">pagan-worship </span>still held sway in Nubia, in spite of the<br/>
Edicts of Theodosius. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nobedes </span>were converted to Christianity<br/>
about 540 AD. under the auspices of the Empress Theodora, and<br/>
shortly afterwards <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nurses</span>, sent by Justinian to Egypt, closed the<br/>
temple of Isis on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span>, and sent its sacred contents to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Constantinople</span>. At <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>adopted the orthodox creed, but<br/>
when Egypt was conquered by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Islam</span>, they exchanged this for the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">monophysite </span>heresy. Although an inscription has been found in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronaos </span>in praise of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Bishop <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theodorus </span>(577 <span style="color: #0000FF;">AD</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicated </span>a portion at least of the temple of Isis to <span style="color: #ff0000;">St. </span>Stephen, it<br/>
is doubtful whether <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila </span>was ever an <span style="color: #0000FF;">episcopal </span>seat. It is certain,<br/>
however, that Christian services were held in the hypostyle. The<br/>
inscriptions and reliefs were plastered over with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-mud </span>or had<br/>
crosses carved upon them, so as to <span style="color: #0000FF;">spare </span>the feelings of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">faithful </span>and to exercise the evil <span style="color: #0000FF;">spirits</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>Like Christianity, <span style="color: #ff0000;">islem </span>was<br/>
late in finding its way to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philas</span>, and there is not a trace <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>mosque<br/>
or anything of that nature on the entire island<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Nubia was <span style="color: #0000FF;">effectually </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">conquered </span>in the 13th cent. by the Egyptian sultans, who<br/>
included the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cataract-region </span>in their private domains, and thus<br/>
secured the temples from destruction .--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Phi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span>was described in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1787 </span>by Norden and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Porsche</span>, though at that time the natives were<br/>
as hostile to strangers as they are <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>friendly and obliging.<br/>
<br/>
Isis, the chief deity of the island, is usually represented <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the<br/>
triad completed by Osiris and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home</span>, but she frequently also<br/>
appears alone. Everywhere, in her various forms, she occupies<br/>
the foremost place, just as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>does at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Denderah</span>. The deities of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>include <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Month</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">twin-gods </span>Shu and Tefnut, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Solo<br/>
</span>and Nut, <span style="color: #ff0000;">0siris-Unnofer </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Agathodaemon</span>) and Isis, Khnum and<br/>
Sati, the gods of the cataracts, Horus the son of Isis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Heather</span>, and<br/>
the child Horus. Thoth, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Safehh</span>, and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">denim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>also frequently<br/>
appear.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Platter </span>is the pearl of Egypt, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">those </span>who have several days to<br/>
spend at the cataract, should certainly take up their abode upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">it<br/>
