<br/>
creation of the world has anything been made like what has been<br/>
erected by the child of the sun <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnumt-Ameu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatasu</span>, who bestows<br/>
life, eternal like the sun'. The queen is uniformly referred to by the<br/>
feminine pronoun, though she is represented as a <span style="color: #ff0000;">man </span>and named'a<br/>
son <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the sun'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the rectangular base of the obelisk it is recorded<br/>
(N. side) that the queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>it in seven months in the 16th and<br/>
17th years of her reign, and (E. side) that it was overlaid with gold,<br/>
that the queen herself weighed out the necessary gold in sacks and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">here</span>, so that (S. side) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">people </span>on both banks beheld it glittering<br/>
at sunrise. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">obelieks </span>are enclosed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fa </span>rectangular granite<br/>
wall, 12-15 ft. in height.<br/>
<br/>
As we proceed towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">R</span>, we pass another Pylon (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">T</span>),<br/>
now completely <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined</span>, and enter a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Smooth </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Coaonnann</span>, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osiristigures </span>representing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmea </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>in each of the spaces to the right<br/>
and left are five pairs of columns<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Between them was a central<br/>
space enclosed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes</span>, with two of the Osiris-statues embedded<br/>
in the well. An inscription informs us that this surrounding <span style="color: #ff0000;">wall<br/>
</span>was raised by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmcs </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">III</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>to cover the monuments of his father<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmee </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>,'so that the monuments of his father Usertesen (12th<br/>
Dyn.) and the monuments of his fathers, kings of Upper and Lower<br/>
Egypt, should not be seen in presence of his own'.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the walls of this narrow room, and on the right and left of<br/>
the gateway with granite pillars which forms the opening <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Pylon </span>V,<br/>
are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">namewlabels </span>of the peoples conquered by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill</span>. The<br/>
S. peoples are named on the right:'List of the S. lands, of the<br/>
Ann <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kenos </span>from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khent-hun~nefer</span>, defeated by His Majesty, he<br/>
wrought havoc among them, their multitude is not known, he brought<br/>
all that belonged to them as living captives to Thebes, to fill the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">works-house </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-Ra</span>'. Beneath are <span style="color: #0000FF;">lid </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">name-cringe </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">conquered </span>tribes of the S. lands; first those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ruth </span>(Ethiopians; the<br/>
Bush of Scripture), than those <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Punt </span>(Arabians), and lastly the<br/>
Libu (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Libyans</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nausea </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>peoples, <span style="color: #0000FF;">above<br/>
</span>which is an inscription:'List of the tribes of the upper <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retennu</span>,<br/>
captured by His Majesty in Magda, the miserable place, their<br/>
children brought by <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>Majesty as living captives to the fortified<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aptwasu </span>(Thebes) from his first campaign, as commanded<br/>
him by Amman, who has led him by good paths'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Two similar lists<br/>
of N. and S. tribes, one of them being still more complete, are to<br/>
be found on Pylon VIII, lying to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">8.</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">camp</span>. p. 146.)<br/>
<br/>
We now traverse a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronaos </span>and enter the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Smother</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span>F), a chamber built of hard granite<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The frequent repetition<br/>
of the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">cfPhilip </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aridmus </span>on its walls might lead one at first to<br/>
suppose that this apartment is a comparatively recent structure,<br/>
dating from the reign of this royal puppet under whom the power<br/>
was really wielded by Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, son of Lague (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Safer</span>). But Philip<br/>
is here named only as restorer, not as founder, and certain <span style="color: #0000FF;">fragments </span>of statues found farther to the E., <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pro </span>as <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shall<br/>
