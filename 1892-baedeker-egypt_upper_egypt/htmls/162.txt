Homer, was also applied by later classical authors to Thebes. Diodorus,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Strobe</span>, Pliny, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Bate of Sinope all make use of it, referring,<br/>
however, to the pylons of the temples in the capital of Upper Egypt.<br/>
With the rising importance of the god and with the increase of his<br/>
wealth, of which they had the disposal, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">archpriests </span>of Ammon<br/>
gradually grew to regard themselves as the chief persons in the<br/>
state; and, after the way had been prepared by a series of weak<br/>
princes, they <span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>in usurping the throne and by their rule<br/>
prepared the ruin of Egyptian power. From the 20th Dye. onwards,<br/>
Thebes began to decay. Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">HI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>indeed adorned the left bank<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>with elaborate buildings; but his immediate successors<br/>
did no more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">how </span>out for themselves deep and richly carved<br/>
graves in the valley of the Kings' Tombs, and the princes of Lower<br/>
Egypt who succeeded the priests of Ammon of the 21st Dyn. were<br/>
the less able to bestow attention upon Thebes, the more eagerly<br/>
they strove to adorn their homes in the Delta with gorgeous structures. Yet even these princes did not wholly abandon <span style="color: #0000FF;">Theb </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>and<br/>
they did not <span style="color: #0000FF;">omit </span>to inscribe pretentious reports of their mighty<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">acts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the walls of the temple of Ammon. The armies of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assyrians </span>penetrated as far as Thebes and plundered it; the Ethiopians<br/>
planted their rule here and honoured <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>with buildings and<br/>
inscriptions; the princes of the 26th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dye</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>did for Sal's what the<br/>
princes of the 18th and 19th Dyn. had done for the city of Ammon,<br/>
but they also paid their homage to the great god of Thebes by<br/>
erecting smaller buildings there. The invading army of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cambyses<br/>
</span>ascended as far as Upper Egypt, but seems to have done little or<br/>
no damage at Thebes. <span style="color: #ff0000;">éNectanebns </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1.</span>, one of the native <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian<br/>
</span>princes who maintained themselves against the Persians, found<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">time </span>and means to add a handsome pylon to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">templs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon</span>.<br/>
Alexander the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Greatand </span>the princes of the house of the Lagidae<br/>
probably found Thebes still a great though decadent city, and they<br/>
assisted to embellish it, as many buildings dating from the period<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemiesgstill </span>attest. After the 22nd <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dye</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the treasures of<br/>
Ethiopia had ceased to enrich Thebes; and when the harbour of<br/>
Alexandria began to attract to itself the produce of Egypt brought<br/>
from the Red Sea to the Nile valley, the vessels of Koptos, with<br/>
their lading of Indian and Arabian goods, but seldom found their<br/>
way S. to the great city of Ammon. Thebes still <span style="color: #0000FF;">remained </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.Con<br/>
