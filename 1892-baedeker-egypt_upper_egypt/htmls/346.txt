<span style="color: #ff0000;">them </span>their native rock, this final operation being probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">accomplished </span>with the aid of wet wedges. Such an Obelisk, still attached<br/>
to the rock, may be seen about 1/2 M. to the S. of the town and<br/>
about as far to the E. of the Nile. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is not easily found, as it is<br/>
frequently more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">ham-covered </span>with sand. At its broadest part<br/>
this obelisk measures <span style="color: #ff0000;">103/2 </span>ft; its length is 92 ft. (72 ft. <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>out),<br/>
not reckoning the pyramidal top, which has already been hewn. The<br/>
economy of material <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-cutters </span>is noteworthy.<br/>
In the quarry near the road and visited by all travellers, is a huge<br/>
Block of Rock, from which the mason has begun to <span style="color: #0000FF;">how </span>both a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">roofing-slab </span>and a column. Here we clearly perceive that the ancients<br/>
well understood how to disintegrate the granite with borers and to<br/>
split it with wedges. Numerous holes were made in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>line<br/>
(probably with the help of <span style="color: #0000FF;">draw-boring</span>), the damp wooden wedges<br/>
were driven in, and in this manner tolerably even fractures were <span style="color: #0000FF;">ohm<br/>
<br/>
</span>tained. The art of splitting the stone by heat was also understood.<br/>
<br/>
The Chapel transported from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Elephantine </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">herein</span>) to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sun </span>by<br/>

It consisted of a single block and its <span style="color: #0000FF;">tram</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">art </span>occupied<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">2000 </span>men for 3 <span style="color: #0000FF;">yam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">x</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>is said to have been 21 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ells </span>long, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">broad</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and<br/>

inside measurement. It had to remain outside the temple at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sale</span>, on<br/>
account of its size and weight. Still more striking, in point of weight at<br/>
least, were the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Blame </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ram </span>), and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>stone Chapel, seen by Herodotus (I, 155) at <span style="color: #0000FF;">gun </span>The<br/>
latter was cubical in form and measured 40 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ells </span>each way; and it has<br/>
been estimated that its weight must have been about 7000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">shipping-tons</span>,<br/>
or more than twice the <span style="color: #0000FF;">burden </span>of a large East Indiaman.<br/>

<br/>
We turn to the right (<span style="color: #ff0000;">W</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>from the quarries and follow the broad<br/>
sandy road <span style="color: #0000FF;">leading </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>. The desert has a <span style="color: #0000FF;">wonderful </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pre </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">serving </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">virtue </span>If the road along which the traveller now rides were<br/>
practicable for carriages, Strabo's description would still <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit </span>it in<br/>
every point.'We <span style="color: #0000FF;">drove</span>', writes the ancient geographer,'from Syene<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuhn</span>) to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>, through a very flat plain about 50 stadia long.<br/>
At many points all along the road, and on both sides, we saw the<br/>
rounded, smooth, and almost conical blocks of dark, hard rock, <span style="color: #0000FF;">resembling </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hermes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">towers</span>, from which mortars are made. Smaller<br/>
blocks lie upon larger ones, and support others in their turn; here<br/>
and there were isolated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nous</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>To this we need only add<br/>
that pious pilgrims <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>wayfarers have chiselled their Names and<br/>
short Inscriptions on many of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">above-mentioned </span>blocks. Princes,<br/>
dignified priests, and warriors, have travelled this way, as far back<br/>
as the times of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemhas </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertesens</span>. Down to a late<br/>
period pilgrims were in the habit of placing inscriptions on these<br/>
stones, accompanied with the representation of the soles of the feet.<br/>
<br/>
Among the more noteworthy of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">Inscriptions </span>are a short one of<br/>
<br/>
the fourth year of Usertesen <span style="color: #ff0000;">l. </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
