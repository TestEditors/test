Not only are the subjects of these representations of great interest,<br/>
but the character of the architectural drawing itself should be noticed. It is something <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sketch-plan </span>and a finished picture.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-plan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i8 </span>clearly indicated, but at the same time an idea<br/>
is given of the appearance of the external elevation of the building.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Clearness </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>truthful reproduction of details are aimed at here as<br/>
zealously as in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure-drawing</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-plan </span>is first sketched<br/>
in, and then the outlines of the facades, and even the doors and<br/>
trees are added <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">us </span>the space allows.<br/>
<br/>
The forms of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">personsrcpresented </span>vary considerably from those<br/>
seen in tombs elsewhere<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Almost all have the same <span style="color: #ff0000;">thickest </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">body </span>and<br/>
lean neck that characterize the king. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>of the latter is, of<br/>
course, a portrait; and it is possible that the courtly artists burdened the subjects with the weaknesses of the prince so that his <span style="color: #0000FF;">deformities </span>might not appear as anything unusual. Amenhotep IV<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>was certainly not a foreigner; but his mother <span style="color: #0000FF;">Til </span>may have been<br/>
one, and may have installed her <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellowwcountrymen </span>at the Egyptian<br/>
court. Even the highest dignitaries have <span style="color: #ff0000;">nun-Egyptian </span>features.<br/>
Among these is the royal favourite <span style="color: #ff0000;">Morita</span>, who is represented on<br/>
the right wall of Tomb 3, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>literally overwhelmed with the golden<br/>
necklaces, <span style="color: #0000FF;">rings</span>, and orders, which the Pharaohs of the 18th Dynasty<br/>
delighted to shower on their loyal adherents; he stands in front of<br/>
the royal family, the members of which are attended by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gn-bearers<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">courtiers </span>of all kinds.'Let him receive gold', says the <span style="color: #ff0000;">inscripw<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tion</span>,'on his neck, on his back, and on his <span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>'. Secretaries make<br/>
a note of the donations and write out the royal patents, which are<br/>
also mentioned elsewhere. The fourth necklace is being hung<br/>
round the neck of Merits, while the fifth and sixth are <span style="color: #0000FF;">handed </span>to<br/>
him by two <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>; a third attendant holds three golden rings.<br/>
The Urma, to whom this favourite belonged, were, in addition to<br/>
their other dignities, the most learned physicians and <span style="color: #0000FF;">high-priests </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Helicpolis </span>(mentioned in the inscription). The sickly prince <span style="color: #0000FF;">naturally </span>pays the highest honours to his physician, one of the Urma<br/>
priests. Another of these priests, named Khui, is mentioned in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ebers </span>Papyrus as having prepared a famous <span style="color: #0000FF;">eye-sores</span>, and it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">possible </span>that Amenhotep IV. may have been blind or, at least, threatened with blindness. His outstretched neck suggests the attitude<br/>
of a blind man, and in the song of one of the priestesses by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">door-post </span>of the same tomb occur the words:'The lord of goodness<br/>
arises.... No other one opens his countenance, healing his <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>his beams'.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>contained the remains of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'truth-loving</span>' <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aahmes</span>, the<br/>
royal secretary, adjutant of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fast-bearers</span>, and first lord of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bedchamber</span>. Here we find one of the great dignitaries celebrating<br/>
the glory of the sun. He praises the beauty of the setting of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lord </span>of the lords and princes of the earth, at sight of whom the<br/>
elect break forth <span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span>rejoicing, at whose <span style="color: #ff0000;">risingez </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ttin </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hole<br/>
