<span style="color: #ff0000;">immederate </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">flattery</span>, and the absence of fact. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>of the conquered<br/>
nations <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>recorded<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>we learn few <span style="color: #0000FF;">particulars </span>of the course of<br/>
the were. The value of the booty is here and there indicated, but it by<br/>
no means corresponds to the gigantic achievements performed by Ramses 111.<br/>
according to the exaggerated representations of his priestly <span style="color: #ff0000;">fiatterers</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>There can be little doubt that he successfully opposed a <span style="color: #0000FF;">lame </span>of several<br/>
peoples, who attacked his kingdom by land and <span style="color: #ff0000;">seat </span>but he did not <span style="color: #0000FF;">penetrate </span>into the heart of Asia as his great ancestors did<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and the critic<br/>
cannot avoid regarding <span style="color: #0000FF;">um </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">puma </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hahn </span>as exaggerated and<br/>
unreliable<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The report on the first pylon, referring to the victory of the<br/>
7th day of the month <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mekhir </span>in the year <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>, contains some passages of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">considerable </span>poetic <span style="color: #0000FF;">form</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>After relating that the enemy had intended to<br/>
settle in Egypt and to till the land as his own, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">account </span>goes on:<br/>
'Death <span style="color: #0000FF;">luau</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1n </span>Tamer (Egypt) for those, who had <span style="color: #0000FF;">come </span>on their own<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fee</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>to the furnace, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>consumed impurity under the glow of<br/>
the heroism of his majesty, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">ins </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ired </span>terror like Baal on high. All<br/>
his limbs are filled with the power <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>victory... His right hand grasps<br/>
multitudes, and over those who place themselves against him his left<br/>
hand <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stretched </span>out like missiles directed against them to <span style="color: #0000FF;">shy </span>them.<br/>
His <span style="color: #ff0000;">battlewscythe </span>(mews) mightily<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>like his father <span style="color: #0000FF;">Month </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kapur </span>(prince<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Libyans), who came as one smitten with blindness to receive <span style="color: #0000FF;">homage</span>, laid down his weapons on the ground with his warriors, and cried<br/>
aloud to heaven to beseech <span style="color: #0000FF;">grace </span>(r <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ebb </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>. His son held his foot and his<br/>
hand and remained standing in his place. But the God, who knew what<br/>
was passing in his inmost mind (what was in <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mummy</span>, fell upon<br/>
their heads like a mountain of granite<span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>Their blood mingled with the<br/>
earth like the overflowing river', <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>0n the S. or Left Pylon are similar representations. Between the<br/>
two <span style="color: #ff0000;">flags-studs </span>the king appears with his fettered enemies before<br/>
the god Ptah, who aims a blow at two enemies. Beneath is another<br/>
horizontal row of ten conquered <span style="color: #0000FF;">people</span>, and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">stole </span>of the 12th year<br/>
of the king imitated from <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stole </span>of the 35th year of Ramses II. at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu-Simbel</span>, containing a dialogue between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fish </span>and the king.<br/>
To the left (<span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>is a colossal figure of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman-Ra</span>, handing the sword<br/>
of victory to the king, beside six <span style="color: #0000FF;">rows-of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fettered </span>enemies.<br/>
<br/>
Within the gateway (Pl. d) leading to the next court is the<br/>
name of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">engraved </span>unusually deeply in the stone. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fore-scours </span>(Pl. D), forming an approximate square of 115 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>, is<br/>
enclosed on all sides, and is not destitute of shade even at midday.<br/>
On the left (8.) are <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-columns </span>and on the right <span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">N</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris..<br/>
</span>statues placed against pillars, which form galleries with the outer<br/>
walls. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>we <span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>imagine this space cleared of rubbish and ruined<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">walls</span>, we can form some idea of its pristine <span style="color: #0000FF;">efi'ect</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Even as it is<br/>
it impresses the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hammer</span>, with its pylons to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>and W. to shut<br/>
out the uninitiated, its <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span>to the N. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">S</span>, and its <span style="color: #ff0000;">magniu<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t1eent </span>decoration in <span style="color: #0000FF;">carvings </span>and inscriptions. Here and elsewhere<br/>
at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Habu </span>we notice that want of symmetry, which is<br/>
frequently made a reproach to the Egyptian artists; but there is no<br/>
doubt that the priestly architects deliberately here placed columns<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>forms opposite each other, with the intention of <span style="color: #0000FF;">dis-guising </span>or relieving the uniformity dictated by the hieratic canon.<br/>
<br/>
We now turn to the Inner Side of the first pylon. To the right<br/>
we see a long hieroglyphic inscription; below, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ghee<br/>
