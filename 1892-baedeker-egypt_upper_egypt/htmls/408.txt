<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">105 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>, in order to form the imposing <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock-facade </span>of this temple.<br/>
At the top we see a row <span style="color: #0000FF;">of'22 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cynocephali </span>(some destroyed),<br/>
which we learn from other Egyptian temples to recognize as worshippers of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sum-god</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Below these are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">oartouohes </span>of the<br/>
king, surrounded with <span style="color: #0000FF;">litmus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">serpents</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Then follows the short dedication inscription of Ramses the Great, which begins in the<br/>
middle and runs in both directions; on the right it styles the king<br/>
'beloved by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>', on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left'beloved </span>by Amman, king of<br/>
the gods'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Still lower, in a recess in the centre of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-wall</span>, is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">full-relief </span>statue of Horus (Harmachis), with the sun on his <span style="color: #0000FF;">head<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the symbols of life in his hands, while below, to the right, is<br/>
<br/>
the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Me</span>, to the left the symbol 1 user, thus expressing the<br/>
<br/>
king's name in <span style="color: #0000FF;">picture-writing</span>. To the right and left is the king<br/>
again, presenting figures which also express his name, and worshipping the god. Below, and somewhat indistinct, are the double<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>of the king.<br/>
<br/>
Our attention is most forcibly attracted to the four seated <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colossi<br/>
</span>(Pl<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>a, b, <span style="color: #ff0000;">o</span>, d), <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>out of the rock, with their backs against the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cliff</span>. That to the left of the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wi</span>. b) has unfortunately been<br/>
violently deprived of its head and arms', which <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>lie on the<br/>
ground in front. The colossus on the other side of the door (Pl<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">c</span>)<br/>
was restored by Seti ll<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Each of those figures is not less than 66 ft.<br/>
high, their various limbs being in proportion<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In spite of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">enor<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mous </span>scale the general <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>is successful, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">countenances<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">7 </span>have a pleasant and intelligent expression. All four represent<br/>
Ramses the Great, as <span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span>testified by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cartonches </span>on the breast<br/>
and arms and between the legs. To the right and left of each are<br/>
standing figures, mostly of <span style="color: #0000FF;">woman</span>; to the right and left of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nofsrtcri </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Merl-cn-mut</span>, consort of Ramses; between the legs<br/>
of the injured colossus, prince <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amhihhopcshf </span>('Ammon in his<br/>
sword'), who is <span style="color: #ff0000;">introduced </span>in the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dan </span>as the oldest son<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">semen</span>) of Ramses 11.; to the left of this colossus <span style="color: #ff0000;">Toe</span>, the king's<br/>
mother. Beside the colossus farthest to the left are two daughters<br/>
of the king, viz. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ncbtwtatl</span>, on the left, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bant-an.ta </span>on the right;<br/>
between the legs is an unnamed female figure<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The figures <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the<br/>
sides of the colossus to the extreme right, the names of which are<br/>
concealed by the sand, probably correspond to these. In 1817 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Balm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">zoni </span>spent <span style="color: #0000FF;">14 </span>days in freeing the temple from the sand that had<br/>
drifted into it from the desert behind. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Burokhardt</span>, however, had<br/>
mentioned it previously. It was again laid <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius </span>in 1844<br/>
and by Mariette in 1869, but the sand has already covered great<br/>
part of it to a considerable depth.<br/>
<br/>
Before we enter the temple our attention is claimed by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greek </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">irrscription </span>which is found on the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">injured </span>colossus, along <span style="color: #0000FF;">wrth<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">various </span>other Greek, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caries </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">hmnioian </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">insoriptionsw </span>It <span style="color: #0000FF;">rups </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as<br/>
