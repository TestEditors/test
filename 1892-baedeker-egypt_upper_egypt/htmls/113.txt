<br/>
</span>Memnonium at Abydos, which contains no fewer than 76 <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>only two of which are slightly injured. The tablet from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple<br/>
<br/>
</span>of Ramses (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">SO</span>, now in London, contains 16 entire and 2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">half<br/>
<br/>
</span>destroyed <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches</span>, while the list of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sahhhrah</span>, discovered by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mariette</span>, has 39 whole and 3 damaged <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mona</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">La </span>Manes, the first historic king of Egypt, <span style="color: #ff0000;">heads<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">m </span>the list. The names following his are those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">w </span>prominent monarchs, at least those whose legitimacy <span style="color: #0000FF;">was<br/>
</span>unquestionable. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heraeleopolitans </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the Hyksos <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
<br/>
</span>naturally left out, but other rulers, of whom we <span style="color: #0000FF;">possess<br/>
<br/>
</span>monuments, have also been apparently deemed unworthy <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
</span>inclusion in this important roll of <span style="color: #0000FF;">honour </span>The merit <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>observing and publishing this inestimable <span style="color: #0000FF;">historical<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">document </span>belongs to Prof. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diimichen<br/>
<br/>
</span>On the left wall of the corridor we again meet Seti and the<br/>
youthful Ramses. The father holds a <span style="color: #0000FF;">censor </span>in his left hand, while<br/>
the son, adorned with the priestly <span style="color: #0000FF;">panther-skin</span>, pours a libation <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the altar in front of him. The titles of the right <span style="color: #ff0000;">well </span>re-appear<br/>
here. The inscription, which the royal pair faces, contains in <span style="color: #ff0000;">system<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">matic </span>order the names of these objects of worship, with their homes,<br/>
whom Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">hue </span>honoured with <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>gifts. The sculpture in this<br/>
corridor, consisting of alto-reliefs on the fine-grained limestone, is<br/>
all executed with the greatest <span style="color: #0000FF;">delicacy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the centre of the right<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">well </span>a door leads into a narrow <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamber</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>t), vaulted in the same<br/>
manner as the sanctuaries (<span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>61), and preceding the stair (Pl. n)<br/>
which leads to the hill at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of the temple. The inscriptions<br/>
here are in excellent preservation, being injured only in a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">places</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>the adjoining figures of Seti and Ramses show the latter arrived at<br/>
manhood and the throne. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Safekh</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">goddess </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>history,'the great<br/>
mistress of books', addresses her darling son Seti. The ceremony of<br/>
foundation, which we find more fully represented and described in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>temples, is also depicted here. The praises of the king<br/>
are sung, and his merits are, at the command of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Re</span>, to be committed<br/>
to writing by the goddess of history. Thoth also <span style="color: #0000FF;">congratulates </span>the<br/>
king in the emphatic manner usual to such inscriptions, and promises<br/>
him an eternal existence and the stability ofhis kingdom for hundreds<br/>
of thousands of years. Thoth is named the tongue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Re </span>and lord<br/>
of the speech of the prophet of truth. This staircase was completed<br/>
while Ramses shared the throne of his father as <span style="color: #0000FF;">iso-ruler</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The other rooms of this part of the building are all more or less<br/>
in ruins. From the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>of the kings<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>gallery we enter a kind of<br/>
peristyle Court (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">G</span>), with seven columns, which perhaps was<br/>
never completed. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">sculpture</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>and hieroglyphics are not very<br/>
carefully executed and appear'en <span style="color: #ff0000;">creur</span>' instead of in high relief<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The most interesting scenes are those on the lower part of the walls,<br/>
representing the slaughter of the cattle, <span style="color: #ff0000;">gazellea</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">antelope</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>which Seti had so lavishly vowed (in the adjoining king's gallery<span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>
