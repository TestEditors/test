<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Architectonic </span>Features of the court must be noticed before we<br/>
proceed to examine its uses. It is 275 ft. wide,<br/>
and covers an area of 9755 sq.yds. On each side a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade<br/>
</span>or stoa is formed by a row of columns and the exterior wall. Eighteen<br/>
columns still stand on the left side, but the row on the right was <span style="color: #0000FF;">interrupted </span>by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>, who has here <span style="color: #0000FF;">placed </span>atemple (Pl. <span style="color: #ff0000;">0</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">projecting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">considerably </span>beyond the S. wall, and at right angles to it. Both<br/>
rows of columns are unsculptured. Another small temple (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pi</span>. B) was<br/>
built in the NE<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>angle of the court by Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenptah</span>. Both<br/>
of these smaller temples are later additions, with no reference to the<br/>
purpose of the court, and they interfere with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cheat </span>designed by<br/>
the original builder. The double row of huge columns in front of<br/>
the doorway of the second pylon was, on the other hand, part of the<br/>
original plan. The lofty shafts, which were terminated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span>capitals of gigantic proportions, taper towards the top, and contract<br/>
rapidly immediately <span style="color: #0000FF;">above </span>the convex bases on which they stand.<br/>
The calyx of the capitals was surrounded with petals, from amidst<br/>
which slender <span style="color: #0000FF;">marsh-plants </span>sprang. In the centre of each was a<br/>
cubical abacus, serving as a pedestal for an image of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>god<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Mariette<br/>
conjectured that a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">hypaethral </span>temple (like that at Philae) stood<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>front of the second pylon, and that not only was there an <span style="color: #0000FF;">additional </span>(sixth) pair of columns adjoining the others but that the<br/>
vaulting of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>whole was rendered possible by two central columns<br/>
between the pairs at each end which are about 36 ft. apart. As,<br/>
however, there is not the <span style="color: #ff0000;">faintest </span>trace of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">conjectural </span>six<br/>
columns, it is perhaps more probable that this <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">represents </span>a processional or <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumphed </span>avenue, formerly covered only<br/>
by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">velarium</span>, and that the continuation of it is to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>recognized<br/>
in the elevated central row of columns in the hypostyle hall (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">126</span>).<br/>
Of the original columns only <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>can now be traced on the left<br/>
side, and one on the right, close to the second pylon, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">terrain<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">notes </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">peristyle </span>on the E. Three still show about <span style="color: #ff0000;">1/3 </span>of the<br/>
original height, one about 1/4, and another about <span style="color: #0000FF;">1/2</span>; the only <span style="color: #0000FF;">Complete </span>column is on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span>Upon this last <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psammetikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, of the<br/>
26th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>, has placed his name over that of the Ethiopian Taharka,<br/>
of the 25th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyan</span>; above, on the abacus, is the name of Ptolemy IV<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Philopator, which also appears on the recently excavated base of<br/>
one of the broken columns. The shaft is composed of 36 courses of<br/>
carefully hewn stone, the capital of 5 courses. The height is 69 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>;<br/>
the greatest breadth of the capital <span style="color: #0000FF;">id </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>, the circumference at the<br/>
top 49 ft. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">above-mentioned </span>second pylon, on the E. side of<br/>
the court, is mostly in ruins. Before the doorway is an <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber </span>(Pl. b), the entrance to which was flanked by two statues of<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>The figure on the left side has fallen down; that on<br/>
the right, broken at the top, <span style="color: #0000FF;">displays </span>excellent workmanship,<br/>
especially <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span>the legs, and recalls the Deed alien figures of the earliest<br/>
periods of Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">am<br/>
