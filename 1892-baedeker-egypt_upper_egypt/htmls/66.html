</span>The colossal figure within this tomb represents Kai, son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tot </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hotep</span>, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">high-priest</span>, a steward of the mysteries of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">word </span>of God,<br/>
a privy <span style="color: #ff0000;">ohsmberlein </span>(superintendent of the works in the inner <span style="color: #ff0000;">palm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ace</span>), and the head of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">name</span>. His paternal <span style="color: #0000FF;">grand-another </span>was a<br/>
daughter of Usertesen 1., the second king of the 12th Dynasty,<br/>
and he was also connected with the royal family on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">motherside</span>. He was likewise related to the family of Nehera and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnumhotep </span>(see p. 15).<br/>
<br/>
The successful transportation of the statue figured in his tomb was<br/>
one of the chief events in the life of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eat</span>. The scene shows us an image,<br/>
13 <span style="color: #0000FF;">all</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>in height, securely fastened to a sled. Small cushions are inserted<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">resent </span>the polished stone from being injured by the ropes. To the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ale </span>are attached four strong cables, each <span style="color: #0000FF;">maimed </span>by 43 workmen (in all<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">172</span>), the'young men<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, as the inscriptions inform us,'of the W. and E.<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">home</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Da </span>the lap of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">figure </span>stands a man clapping his <span style="color: #0000FF;">handy</span>,<br/>
probably the leader and time-giver of the song of the workmen, whose<br/>
task was facilitated by rhythmical movement. To this day in Egypt and<br/>
elsewhere the <span style="color: #ff0000;">some </span>custom is observed wherever the strength of many men<br/>
is united in some common exertion, as in the sailor's chant in raising<br/>
the anchor or hoisting <span style="color: #0000FF;">Milt </span>A man facing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">time</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">keeper </span>knocks two<br/>
wooden stamps together, obviously to transmit the <span style="color: #ff0000;">roper </span>time to <span style="color: #ff0000;">those<br/>
</span>too <span style="color: #0000FF;">far </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>to hear distinctly the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand-clapping </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0 </span>the leader. On the<br/>
prow of the sled, behind the rings to which the ropes are fastened, stands<br/>
a man pouring water on the ground to prevent the heavily loaded sled<br/>
from taking fire by friction. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Water-carriers </span>stand <span style="color: #0000FF;">ready </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">refill </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>empty<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">imbert </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thane </span>are followed by other labourers <span style="color: #ff0000;">hearing </span>notched beams,<br/>
or laying under the sledge when necessary. Three bailiffs or stewards,<br/>
with sticks, are each attended by four men, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">seem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>their simple<br/>
costume to be foreman, <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-masons</span>, or extra-hands<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At the top are<br/>
depicted seven <span style="color: #ff0000;">wellsqoipped </span>companies of infantry, marching in <span style="color: #0000FF;">stiff<br/>
</span>military order towards the advancing colossus. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>bear tridents<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mumbling </span>those in the usual representations of Neptune, which may<br/>
either have been used as <span style="color: #0000FF;">field-standards </span>or for driving the cowardly<br/>
into action.<br/>
<br/>
This highly instructive representation shows, among other points,<br/>
how unlimited was the authority of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nomarch </span>over the people of his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>and how freely, not to say extravagantly, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">could </span>a ply human<br/>
labour in <span style="color: #0000FF;">meeting </span>his <span style="color: #0000FF;">anda</span>. One is tempted to pity the <span style="color: #0000FF;">core </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>labourers<br/>
and to forget how <span style="color: #0000FF;">en'h</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>which seem petty or even obnoxious to one<br/>
generation may have seemed to their ancestors worthy of an unlimited<br/>
expenditure of time, blood, and wealth. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the time of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pyramidbuilding </span>12th Dynasty it was accounted <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>noble and reputable thing to<br/>
erect the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hugest </span>and most durable monuments. The mass of the people,<br/>
who seem to have regarded the might of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">oppressors </span>in the same<br/>
light as we regard the workings of destiny, were proud to have had a<br/>
share in the erection of any specially important monument. Similar<br/>
considerations are suggested by <span style="color: #0000FF;">seem </span>in the tombs of the pyramids, and<br/>
the inscription accompanying the <span style="color: #ff0000;">abovedescrihed </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">picture </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gives </span>us chapter<br/>
and verse for the accuracy of this view. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>runs as follows:'Transport<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirteen-ell </span>statue made of stone from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hatnub</span>. Behold, the way<br/>
by which it was to be transported was of extraordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty</span>. Truly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>was also the toil of the people in drawing the mighty mass along<br/>
it, in dragging (the colossus) in <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">atom </span>I ordered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hands </span>of young<br/>
men to march and prepare the way for it, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">watchmen</span>, carpenters,<br/>
and so forth. The most important were among them. The order was<br/>
issued that <span style="color: #0000FF;">men</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>strong arm should go forth to <span style="color: #0000FF;">fetch </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>. My heart<br/>
was full of content, and my <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellow-citizens </span>all rejoiced. The scene was<br/>
extremely <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful </span>to witness; the old man leans on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mum </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">strong </span>withstood the weak-hearted and timid. They thus became so strong<br/>
that each <span style="color: #0000FF;">one</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">effected </span>as much as a thousand. <span style="color: #0000FF;">And </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ue<br/>
