<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Abd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elsgumah</span>, as in our five days plan<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The tombs to be visited may<br/>
be found without a guide. They are reached by ascending the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>side of<br/>
the Libyan mountains in a direct line from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum</span>. Many of the<br/>
tombs here are inhabited by <span style="color: #ff0000;">fe112Nm </span>The sepulchral chambers serve<br/>
as <span style="color: #ff0000;">dwellingvplaces</span>, wooden doors are hung in the entrances, and the<br/>
fore-court is often enclosed by a clay <span style="color: #ff0000;">well </span>for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confinement </span>of their<br/>
live stock. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>front of most of these cave-dwellings stand covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">up<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">linders </span>like gigantic mushrooms, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>mud and straw kneaded <span style="color: #ff0000;">ton<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gather</span>. These are the primitive <span style="color: #0000FF;">granaries </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>inhabitants <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">i'Abd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elKurnah</span>, several of whom are <span style="color: #ff0000;">we1i-ttrdo</span>, with houses of Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">bricks</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eonepieuoue </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>a considerable distance. Those who are desirous of staying<br/>
any length of time should make arrangements with the wealthy and worthy<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Cept</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Teams</span>, uncle of the German consular agent at <span style="color: #0000FF;">honor</span>. The erection of a house for travellers has been under consideration, and would<br/>
be of especial benefit to scholars by sparing them the daily journey to<br/>
and from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lusor</span>. Shelter may be found in the house of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muhammad'Ahd</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sin-Read </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span>, provisions being brought from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Luror</span>. Several European scholars have <span style="color: #0000FF;">chosen'Abd-tIAN</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>as their centre for investigations on the<br/>
W. hank, among <span style="color: #ff0000;">them</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Champollion</span>, Wilkinson, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius </span>(whose lodging<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>is still known by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">felldhin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">as </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">gear </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lepsius</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Prisse<br/>
</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">d'Avennes</span>, and Ebers. The visitor to the tombs must first face some<br/>
savage dogs, but he will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>thoroughly <span style="color: #ff0000;">repaid </span>partly by the interest which<br/>
some of the tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford</span>, and partly by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">magnificent </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">View </span>which is<br/>
obtained from those in the higher positions, especially at sunset. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">this<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">part </span>of the Necropolis of Thebes were buried the wealthy nobility of the<br/>
8th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dye</span>, upon whose tombs large sums of money must have been spent.<br/>
The inscriptions record that the deceased were in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">lifetime </span>invested<br/>
with the highest spiritual and temporal dignities and that they enjoyed<br/>
almost royal estates, their pride in which they show in sculptures and<br/>
inscriptions. However death is not forgotten in these tombs, for there is<br/>
no lack of funereal epitaphs. In almost all of <span style="color: #0000FF;">them </span>too we <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>genealogical tables, by which we learn that many of those buried here were<br/>
related to each other.<br/>
<br/>
The more important tombs were numbered by Wilkinson, but most<br/>
of the figures have been obliterated. In 1885 Prof. Eisenlohr renumbered<br/>
the tombs, in all <span style="color: #ff0000;">1127</span>, including those with no inscriptions. In the following <span style="color: #0000FF;">description</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>of the tombs reference is made to these numbers, which<br/>
appear in the adjoining small plan. If time <span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span>limited, it will be <span style="color: #ff0000;">truthcient </span>to visit the tombs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khe-em-hat</span>, Ramses, <span style="color: #0000FF;">mun</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sen-waster</span>, Anna,<br/>
Horemheb, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramenkhepersencb</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller is recommended to begin with two tombs on the<br/>
<br/>
eastern side of the hill behind the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum</span>. The one to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left<br/>
<br/>
</span>is that <span style="color: #ff0000;">othaucma-hat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>: <span style="color: #ff0000;">it </span>(No.120), <span style="color: #ff0000;">superinton-s<br/>
</span>dent of the royal granaries, of the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">ot'Amenhotep </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">III</span>. The tomb<br/>
has been long known, and in consequence is much injured. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>lies<br/>
behind a square court cut out of the hill, and has two other tombs<br/>
near it.<br/>
<br/>
The tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">mrmhdt </span>consists of three halls lying one behind the<br/>
other, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>and third of which are at right angles <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">its </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">h </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Un<br/>
