<br/>
31/2 M. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dan</span>, on the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank</span>, prettily situated beneath <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamoree </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">date-palms</span>, contains <span style="color: #0000FF;">inertia-houses</span>. The one <span style="color: #0000FF;">brick-build</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>ing is the residence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rasher</span>, who was formerly independent<br/>
ruler <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lower </span>Nubia and owned a large harem. Outside the town,<br/>
about <span style="color: #0000FF;">half-way </span>to the hill, lies the mosque of a saint. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">top </span>of<br/>
the hill <span style="color: #0000FF;">command </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span>an attractive view of the town and the Nile<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Near<br/>
its <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot </span>lies the small and unfortunately much injured Rock Temple<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Deer</span>. The vestibule, the sides of which were formed by the<br/>
smoothed rocks of the hill, and which was 421/2 ft. deep by 46 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft.<br/>
</span>broad in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>air, contained a triple row of pillars, of which the<br/>
hindmost alone is standing. This row has Osiris-figures against the<br/>
pillars (as at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet-Habu</span>, p. 175, <span style="color: #0000FF;">em</span>). The two front rows and<br/>
the gateway are now represented only by fragments a few feet in<br/>
height. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>of the left side of the gateway are some traces<br/>
of a warlike scene, with chariots and warriors. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>right <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-wall<br/>
</span>of the vestibule was covered with warlike representations, now much<br/>
damaged, in three rows. In the topmost row only the legs of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>are now left. In the second row Ramses IL, founder of this<br/>
temple, can be distinguished in his chariot accompanied by a lion,<br/>
before a group of prisoners. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">lowest </span>row showed the king<br/>
launching arrows against his <span style="color: #0000FF;">fleeing </span>fees. We see the fugitives <span style="color: #0000FF;">conveying </span>their wounded to the mountains, where a herdsman's family,<br/>
surrounded by their domestic animals, wait in grief and anxiety for<br/>
their son. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left wall also are remains of three scenes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">include<br/>
</span>ing one in which the king leads two rows <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>captives to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>.<br/>
The third row of pillars, hewn out of the rock and still standing,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dedications </span>from the king to various gods. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">presentation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>wall of this hall, to the right and left of the entrance<br/>
into the dark excavated part of the temple (lights necessary), are<br/>
specially <span style="color: #0000FF;">effective..</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>On the right side the king holds by the hair some foes, bending<br/>
in presence of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-Ra</span>, while between the king's legs is his<br/>
lion, here said to follow the king and to slay his enemies. The<br/>
heads of the king and the god are unfortunately destroyed. To the<br/>
left of this scene are two smaller ones showing the king before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fish<br/>
</span>and (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sekhet</span>) before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thoth</span>. Beneath is a row of the king's daughters<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">slum</span>, corresponding to a row of his sons, with fans, headed<br/>
by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amsnhithopcskf</span>, on the left wall<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The chief scene on the left<br/>
wall, above the king's <span style="color: #0000FF;">sons</span>, shows the king fighting against his fees<br/>
in presence of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hawk-headed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, with the lion biting the<br/>
leg of one of the fees. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">small </span>adjoining scene, Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">presents<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">WK </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ram's-headed </span>Khnum with a figure of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ma</span>, goddess of truth<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
