<br/>
see, that a temple must have stood upon this <span style="color: #0000FF;">spot </span>even before the<br/>
epoch of the Hyksos. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thobuilding </span>of every temple, without exception, began with the construction of the sanctuary; and beyond<br/>
doubt, we are here standing in front of the most ancient part of the<br/>
entire temple of Ammon. The granite pillars to the right and left,<br/>
on which a <span style="color: #0000FF;">large'flower-Calyx </span>appears between two smaller ones,<br/>
also date from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1H</span>. Beyond these pillars and a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber </span>we reach the space usually regarded as the Sanctuary. It is<br/>
built entirely of pink granite, and is divided into two chambers, a<br/>
very uncommon arrangement, although easily <span style="color: #ff0000;">explainedin </span>the present<br/>
case (see below)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The front chamber, opening to the W., is 19 ft.<br/>
long, the hinder one, opening to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">K</span>, over 25 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The roof has<br/>
been completely destroyed; and a slab of granite, leaning obliquely<br/>
downwards, seems as though on the point of falling. The latter<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">adorned </span>with stars, and traces of colour are seen both upon it<br/>
and upon the walls; but the sculptures were never fully completed,<br/>
and the red outlines which served as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>guide to the sculptor may<br/>
still be made out here and there. The holes in which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">doorhinges </span>were fixed, still show traces of <span style="color: #0000FF;">verdigris</span>, a proof that the<br/>
hinges were made of copper or bronze<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The entire double-chamber and the pillars at its entrance date<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">rom </span>the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmcs </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1H</span>. Mariette believed, probably with<br/>
justice, that the actual sanctuary, or at least the original sanctuary<br/>
of the 12th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>, lay behind (<span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>of) the granite chamber,<br/>
because that would alone <span style="color: #0000FF;">axphain </span>the opening at the back of the<br/>
chamber. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">stole </span>preserved in the museum at Gizeh records that<br/>
the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karmic </span>was in existence as early as the close of the<br/>
11th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>, though then of little importance. Wilkinson found the<br/>
name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l. </span>(12th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>) on a shattered pedestal to the S.<br/>
of the sanctuary; and an inscription of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">21st </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dyna</span>, discovered by<br/>
E. de Rouge in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">southmost </span>court of the temple (in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S.E</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>angle,<br/>
to the right of the entrance by the pillars) contains an announcement<br/>
by a certain Amenhotep, chief priest under Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IX</span>, that the<br/>
sanctuary of the temple of Ammon was built in the time of Usertesen <span style="color: #ff0000;">I. </span>and then restored by himself. Two <span style="color: #ff0000;">aisles </span>in the quarries of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Maisara </span>near Cairo (Vol. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, p. 405) record that King Aahmes, the<br/>
conqueror of the Hyksos, <span style="color: #0000FF;">caused </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stones </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quarried </span>for the<br/>
temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, in the 21st and 22nd year of his reign. At all<br/>
events the ancient sanctuary stood near the site of the one <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>before us, if not actually on the same spot<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>entirely rebuilt<br/>
it, providing it with two doors, a peculiarity commented upon<br/>
above. The W. entrance must have existed before his time, for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>was turned towards the portions of the temple built by his<br/>
ancestors. When <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes</span>, however, added the large new <span style="color: #0000FF;">structure </span>farther to the E. (p. 138), <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>connected it with the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancient </span>holy place, dividing the latter in two and adding a W. doorway, so that it became the goal for the processions <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">K</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">at<br/>
