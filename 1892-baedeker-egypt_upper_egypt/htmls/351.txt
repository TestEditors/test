Arabian Nights ends as follows:<span style="color: #0000FF;">'So </span>they lived in the bosom of happiness<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>seems as though this legend had arisen on Egypt soil, and as<br/>

</span>The rocky island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Block</span>, opposite <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philm</span>, seems to have been<br/>
an even earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">pilgrim-resort </span>than the latter; yet there was probably<br/>
a temple also on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>in comparatively early times. In the 4th<br/>

</span>The principal temple, like the island itself, was sacred to Isis,<br/>
whose priests resided here down to comparatively late times as a<br/>
learned college. <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>one of the graves of Osiris was situated here,<br/>

</span>to the shrine of the mysterious, benign, and healing goddess<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Even<br/>
under Ptolemy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Physkon </span>the priests were compelled to petition the<br/>
king to check the superabundant stream of pilgrims, who consumed<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-stores </span>and threatened to reduce the priests to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necessity </span>of withholding from the gods their bounden <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>(comp.<br/>
p. 284). <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>all the walls and columns of the temple are inscriptions, placed there by Greek or Roman officials, <span style="color: #0000FF;">tourists</span>, and pilgrims.
