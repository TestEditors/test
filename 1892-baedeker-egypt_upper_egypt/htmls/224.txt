<br/>
statues of Osiris, while on the W. (rear) side, the roof of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>passage was supported by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Osiriswcaryatides </span>(facing the<br/>
court) and papyrus-bud columns. The N. and S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnades </span>have<br/>
almost completely disappeared, but four <span style="color: #0000FF;">caryatide-pillars </span>still stand<br/>
on the E. and as many on the W. Towards the W. end, in the<br/>
direction of the entrance to the hypostyle hall, afterwards to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>described, a number of steps ascend from the pavement of the court<br/>
to the doorway. Standing <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the doorway of the second pylon and<br/>
looking westward through the central door of the hypostyle hall<br/>
and through the smaller doorway in its farther (<span style="color: #0000FF;">W</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>side, we <span style="color: #0000FF;">could<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mand </span>an architectural perspective of great charm. The builder has<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">succeeded </span>in producing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>of distance and size by raising<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor-level </span>of the temple towards the W. and by gradually<br/>
diminishing the size of the doorways that succeed each other in the<br/>
same axis.<br/>
<br/>
In the second court the representations on the W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Second </span>Pylon (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. e), in front of which rose the E. row of <span style="color: #0000FF;">nary</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>tides, are of special interest. The S. side of the wall has completely<br/>
collapsed. In the midst of'the ruins project two blocks of stone,<br/>
which bear <span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span>blue stream (to the right of the beholder in the second court).<br/>
To the extreme left, the Pharaoh, much larger than the other<br/>
warriors, dashes along in his chariot with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">bow </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>This is<br/>
one of the most vigorous of the numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle-scenes </span>that have<br/>
been preserved on Egyptian pylons. The leaping lion beside the<br/>
king's chariot is part of its adornment merely, though at the first<br/>
glance it is apt to be taken for the king's <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle-companion </span>preparing for a mighty leap. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span>perhaps had this in his mind when<br/>
he <span style="color: #0000FF;">described </span>the relief of a fortress <span style="color: #0000FF;">surrounded </span>by water, and the<br/>
Pharaoh dashing against the foe along with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fierce </span>lion that used<br/>
to accompany <span style="color: #0000FF;">him </span>in battle. The Asiatics fall before the onset of<br/>
the king like <span style="color: #0000FF;">ears </span>of corn before a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hail-storm</span>. Huddled <span style="color: #0000FF;">perl-melt<br/>
</span>in confused heaps, pierced by <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrow</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>or trodden down by the horses,<br/>
the Kheta fall a prey to death<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Orontes flows by the side of<br/>
the combatants and crowds of Kheta are hurled into it; warriors,<br/>
horses, and chariots sink beneath the waves. We are irresistibly<br/>
reminded of the crossing of the Red Sea by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Israelites</span>, that took<br/>
place only half a century later.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Pharaoh</span>'s chariots and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">best<br/>
</span>hath he cast <span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span>the see: his chosen captains also are drowned in<br/>
the Red sea. The depths have covered them: they sank into the<br/>
bottom as a stone' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Enod</span>. xv, <span style="color: #0000FF;">d</span>, 5). Farther to the right, beneath<br/>
the fortress, some soldiers hold out a rescuing hand to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dreams<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ing</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Everything indicates that we have here a free repetition of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">battlenscene </span>on the first pylon. The battle rages <span style="color: #0000FF;">neat </span>Katesh,<br/>
among the slain here also are <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khirapasor</span>, the historiographer <span style="color: #ff0000;">oi<br/>
</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan </span>prince, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kerobatusa </span>his <span style="color: #0000FF;">charioteer</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Titure</span>, chief of his<br/>
attendants, Pisa his master of the horse (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasen</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ete</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
