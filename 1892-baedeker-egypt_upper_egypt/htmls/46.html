bear the same name. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">fapades </span>of the most important of them are<br/>
partly uncovered. The street of tombs, which is now accessible, <span style="color: #0000FF;">presents </span>the appearance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">chill-side </span>covered with masonry, <span style="color: #0000FF;">manned </span>with<br/>
stucco, and provided with <span style="color: #0000FF;">ante-chambers</span>. The mouth of each tomb is<br/>
towards the E.; the leaning external walls are generally of Nile bricks,<br/>
richly embellished with the linear patterns which afterwards formed the<br/>
favourite <span style="color: #0000FF;">decoration </span>of the sides of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>(which were imitations of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomtr-ftrpBdeO</span>.

admirably preserved colours are also less conventional <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>those seen in<br/>
later monuments.<br/>

The first <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>tomb which we reach from the 8., was that of Prince<br/>

<br/>

</span>were 3 kings of this name, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">let</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">3rd</span>, and 6th <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dfiut</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the left<br/>
wall of the corridor leading to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tomb~chamber</span>, we see the deceased<br/>
in a sitting posture, and on the right wall he is represented standing,<br/>
with his wife behind him. Adjacent are men and women presenting<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">od'erings</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mastabas </span>of Ti and Ptahhotep. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">flesh-tint </span>of the men<br/>
is red, and that of the women pale yellow, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>circumstance, especially in a monument of this early period, is important as tending to<br/>
prove the Asiatic <span style="color: #0000FF;">origin </span>of the Egyptian nobles<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span>of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">persona </span>represented are of the Caucasian, and not of the Ethiopian<br/>

a district named that'of the white sow<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, which proves that pigs were reared<br/>
in Egypt as early as the time of Snefru. The pig in this group is very<br/>

</span>as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>determinative symbol. The advanced condition of <span style="color: #0000FF;">industrial </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pursuits</span>, showing that the Egyptians already practised the art in which,<br/>
according to Pliny, they afterwards excelled, is proved by the character<br/>
of the dress worn by the women represented on the right side of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">passage</span>, consisting of <span style="color: #0000FF;">black </span>and white cotton <span style="color: #0000FF;">stuff</span>, with pleasing<br/>
patterns on the borders. He tells us that they were not in the habit of<br/>
painting the materials for their dress, but of dipping them in certain<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fluids </span>They were coloured with boiling dyes, and came out impressed<br/>
with a pattern. Although the boilers contained one colour only, it is<br/>
said to have imparted several <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>tints to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">studs </span>dyed in them.<br/>
- In order to impart a durable colour to the larger <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>represented<br/>
here, an entirely unique process was employed. The outlines were engraved on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mug </span>while the surfaces enclosed by them were divided<br/>
into deeply incised squares, which were <span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">stucco </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">different<br/>
</span>colours, the flesh-tint of the men being <span style="color: #0000FF;">red</span>, that of the women yellow,<br/>
