festivals, as even among the representations in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum </span>and<br/>
elsewhere a conspicuous place is given to it<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It might well be <span style="color: #0000FF;">solemn-iced </span>in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium</span>, for Khem caused the new birth of the dead<br/>
god, and the soul separated from the body arose to new life, as the<br/>
vanished orb of night returns at the new moon. As the inscription<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-yr-het </span>says, the heir to the throne succeeded the dead<br/>
Pharaoh on the following day, just as one moon succeeds another<br/>
after a moonless night. The inscription above the reliefs <span style="color: #0000FF;">would </span>still<br/>
preserve for us their subject even if the latter had disappeared. It<br/>
runs as follows:'In the month Pakhon, at the festival of the god<br/>
Khem, at the appearance of the light of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moon-god</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The king,<br/>
crowned with his helmet, comes in his litter. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">body-guard </span>goes<br/>
before him. Each bears at his side shield, spear, and sword. The<br/>
lords of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">retinue</span>, the higher and lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>come behind him,<br/>
and after them the princes <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>warriors. The chief orator of <span style="color: #0000FF;">festivals </span>(kherheb) conducts the festival of his father <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>king presents to his father Khem great <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>of bread, beer,<br/>
cattle, geese, and all good things. <span style="color: #ff0000;">KhemLthe </span>lord of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Son</span>, is brought<br/>
forward, and his son Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>advances before him. The god<br/>
wears the double feather <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>his head, and about his neck a <span style="color: #ff0000;">finelyworked </span>chain from which at his left arm hangs the portrait of the<br/>
goddess Ma. The kherheb strikes up a dance, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">choirwmaster<br/>

god. Then also appear before the god his vowed servants, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">portraits </span>of the kings of Upper and Lower Egypt, as the divine ancestors. No more follows, for the god places himself down upon his<br/>
staircase, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>Majesty <span style="color: #0000FF;">offers </span>a great <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>to his father <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khern</span>,<br/>
the consort (<span style="color: #0000FF;">hull</span>) of his mother. Behold, there also is the white<br/>
hull before His Majesty, <span style="color: #ff0000;">eto.</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>In presence of the living king and<br/>
of the royal ancestral images an attendant brings the black blade of<br/>
a sickle inlaid with gold, and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">shoot </span>of corn, and presents them to<br/>
the king. Then the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ranger </span>(mamit), walking round the king seven<br/>
times, says'The king has reaped with the sickle that is in his<br/>
hand, he raises it to his nose, he lays it down before Khem, who<br/>
gives the king the harvest. The king quits the staircase, turns to<br/>
the N., and walks round the staircase, etc. <span style="color: #ff0000;">m- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>We shall now see how<br/>

very interesting series begins to the left (W.), on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>colonnade. First appears the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharaoh</span>, on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">throne</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">shaped<br/>

four are princes of the blood. Attendants wave fans; and three<br/>
smaller figures with <span style="color: #0000FF;">feather-mas </span>are supposed to be marching by<br/>
the side of the litter. Behind the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharaoh </span>are the two goddesses of<br/>
