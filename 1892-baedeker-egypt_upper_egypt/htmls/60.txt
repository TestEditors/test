<br/>
the son of the Lady Hanna, who was one of the chief dignitaries<br/>
of the kingdom, bore the title of an <span style="color: #ff0000;">capo </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>or prince, governed<br/>
the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mall </span>in time of peace, and commanded a division of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">army </span>in war. To the left and right of the entrance he is <span style="color: #0000FF;">depicted </span>on a throne with <span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>feet, holding his <span style="color: #0000FF;">commander</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>baton in<br/>
his hand. Inside the <span style="color: #0000FF;">door </span>are two <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-preserved </span>inscriptions,<br/>
out in the stone. That to the right (8.) informs us that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha<br/>
</span>departed this life in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ddrd </span>year of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ueertesen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, corresponding<br/>
to the 25th year of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">governorship </span>of Ameni. He undertook all<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">wars'soiling </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ap-stream</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>. he campaigned only against<br/>
the dwellers of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S.</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'miserable </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kushites</span>', as they are called<br/>
in the inscription. In those days the arms of the Pharaohs had not<br/>
yet been carried <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>The Sinai peninsula, with its<br/>
mines, is the only district in this direction which excited the Egyption lust of conquest. From his southern campaigns <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha<br/>
</span>brought home much gold <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>other booty. The inscription to the<br/>
left (<span style="color: #0000FF;">NO </span>also mentions a victorious campaign towards the S., but<br/>
is of <span style="color: #0000FF;">special </span>interest for the light it throws on the truly human<br/>
feelings of this <span style="color: #ff0000;">bye-gone </span>time. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span>describes his <span style="color: #ff0000;">occupantions </span>in time of peace as follows (beginning at the fourth line from<br/>
below):<span style="color: #ff0000;">'1 </span>cultivated the entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>of Mah with many workpeople. I troubled no child and oppressed no widow, neither did<br/>
I keep a fisherman from his <span style="color: #0000FF;">fishing </span>or a herdsman <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>his <span style="color: #0000FF;">hard</span>.<br/>
There was no head of a village whose people I had taken away for<br/>
compulsory labour, and there was no one unhappy in my days or<br/>
hungry in my times. When, however, a famine arose, I tilled all<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>of Mah, from its <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span>to its N. boundary, and<br/>
gave nourishment and life to its inhabitants. So there was no one<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>who died of hunger<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>To the widow I allowed as much<br/>
as to the wife of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>man, and in all that I did <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>never preferred the<br/>
great man to the small one. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men </span>the Nile rose again and <span style="color: #0000FF;">every-n<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flourished </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fields</span>, trees, and all else<span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">cut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>nothing<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The paintings in the interior of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-chamber </span>proper are<br/>
unfortunately very much faded, and they have also been <span style="color: #0000FF;">considerably </span>injured, <span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>in recent years. Some figures of <span style="color: #ff0000;">warrlors </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">which </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">snll </span>remain, armed with club and <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>or club and lance,<br/>
have a foreign appearance, as their skin is of a lighter colour than<br/>
that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians</span>, and their hair and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beards </span>are red.<br/>
<br/>
Tomb No<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>2 is that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnumhotep</span>, the son of Nehera. It owes<br/>
its origin to a member of a family of high rank, in which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office<br/>
</span>of governor of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>seems to have been hereditary for several <span style="color: #0000FF;">generations</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, Usertesen <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span>, the first<br/>
kings of the 12th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dyn.</span>, showered titles and <span style="color: #0000FF;">dignifies </span>with a free<br/>
hand on this family, which in return clung to the royal line with<br/>
peculiar loyalty and <span style="color: #0000FF;">affection </span>By a wonderful piece of good fortune<br/>
we are able to reproduce the entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">family</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tree </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,1. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
