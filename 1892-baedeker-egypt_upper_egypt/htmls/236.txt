<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Medina </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Habu</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">recess</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Route. 173<br/>
<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">opposite </span>each other, are some curious projecting heads<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">These<br/>
</span>are, as is still clearly visible, representations of foreign peoples <span style="color: #0000FF;">conquered </span>by the Pharaoh, and probably served to support a balcony,<br/>
or to fasten the <span style="color: #0000FF;">velar-is</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>which shaded the entrance to the temple.<br/>
The reliefs on the exterior walls of the pavilion are much mutilated.<br/>
On the walls facing us as we approach, of the wings b and c, we<br/>
may recognize (towards the top) the Pharaoh, holding a number of<br/>
enemies by the hair and raising his <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle-axe </span>to strike, while <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ame<br/>
</span>men <span style="color: #0000FF;">Be</span>, on the right, <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>him the<br/>
<br/>
sword of victory. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Low </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">down</span>, immediately above the sloping sub<br/>
structure, are the captive princes of the conquered peoples. In<br/>
these, as in all representations of foreign tribes at Medinet <span style="color: #0000FF;">Habu</span>,<br/>
careful attention is paid to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">race-type </span>and the costumes and<br/>
weapons of the various conquered peoples. Even those who are not<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptologists </span>will at once perceive that here we have to do for the<br/>
most part with tribes <span style="color: #0000FF;">entirely </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dinerent </span>from <span style="color: #ff0000;">th </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ose </span>against whom the<br/>
kings of the 18th and 19th Dyn. <span style="color: #0000FF;">waned</span>. The present pictures represent especially the western neighbours of the Nile valley, the<br/>
Libyans and the allied (and apparently related) islanders of the<br/>
Mediterranean, who even in the time of Merenptah made an <span style="color: #0000FF;">expedition </span>against Egypt, and who after their repulse returned with<br/>
new and stronger forces in the reign of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">HI</span>. All are depicted<br/>
with light complexions, a circumstance as natural in the case of the<br/>
islanders as it seems strange in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">case </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Libyans</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The latter,<br/>
however, must be regarded as immigrants from the north, among<br/>
whom the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mashuasha </span>played an important part. Along with the<br/>
Pelasgians, Etruscans, Danai, Sicilians, Sardinians, Oscans, etc.,<br/>
they were first conquered by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">TIL</span>, and then permitted to<br/>
take service under the Pharaohs, at whose court, especially under<br/>
the 22nd Dyn., they were destined to play an important part. On<br/>
the lower part of the E. Wall of Wing <span style="color: #ff0000;">c </span>we perceive their <span style="color: #0000FF;">captive<br/>
</span>representatives beside those of the Libyans and of two other western<br/>
peoples, whose banner the Ethiopians also followed. On the E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall<br/>
</span>of Wing <span style="color: #0000FF;">b </span>are captive princes of the islanders, among whom <span style="color: #0000FF;">specially </span>to be noted are the leader of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zekkari</span>, with a curious<br/>
hood, the prince of the'Sardinians from the sea', and of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Tursha </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Etruscans</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the sea', whose head is adorned with a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fisher</span>'s cap.<br/>
<br/>
Other representations occur to the right and left in the Narrow<br/>
Court, over which the <span style="color: #ff0000;">aboveumentioned </span>velaria probably extended<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>As in all other parts of this temple, the deeds of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">ill. </span>are here<br/>
celebrated. To the left as we enter, the king, bow in hand, presents<br/>
to Ammon the conquered tribes, arranged in two columns and bound<br/>
with lotus-bands<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>0n the right (<span style="color: #0000FF;">NO </span>wall Ramses 111. receives the<br/>
weapons of victory from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. In the narrow <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gateway </span>to the<br/>
first court (Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>) is the portrait of the Pharaoh <span style="color: #ff0000;">asthcovercomor</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Of<br/>
<br/>
