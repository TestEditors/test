Khnumhotep appears in a litter, inspecting <span style="color: #0000FF;">hie </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">potter</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">carpenters</span>. Some of the latter are felling palm-trees and others are <span style="color: #0000FF;">building </span>a boat for the journey to Abydos (see below)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The most interesting of the scenes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">artisan </span>life in the lower rows are the<br/>
representations of women baking and weaving, under the supervision<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">eunuchs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The entire Rear Wall is occupied by a tastefully<br/>
arranged representation of the water-sports in which the deceased<br/>
took delight. A forest of papyrus reeds grows by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">waterside</span>,<br/>
thickly peopled by all kinds of <span style="color: #0000FF;">furred </span>and feathered game. To the<br/>
right and left <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnumhotep </span>is depicted in his boat, accompanied in<br/>
one instance by his wife <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khuti</span>, who is painted a lighter colour.<br/>
Here he <span style="color: #0000FF;">transfixes </span>large <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-fish</span>, there he holds the birds <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>has<br/>
brought down by his darts. Above are birds caught in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">not</span>. In the<br/>
river swim characteristically drawn fish, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>crocodiles and hippopotami are also <span style="color: #0000FF;">seem </span>A man who has fallen into the water is being<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">healed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">again </span>The dominant idea of the chase is farther carried<br/>
out in the representations of a hawk seizing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">gaily-plumaged </span>bird<br/>
and an <span style="color: #0000FF;">ibis </span>capturing a butterfly.<br/>
<br/>
The N. Wall (to the left on entering) is the most important of<br/>
all, as upon it is the celebrated picture of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Semitic race bringing<br/>
cosmetics (<span style="color: #ff0000;">mestem</span>) and other presents to Khnumhotep. In the<br/>
lowest row, to the right, are seen the secretaries of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnumhotep</span>,<br/>
receiving the report of the steward of the cattle, who is followed by<br/>
the herds and shepherds<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Just </span>above this is Khnumhotep himself,<br/>
represented on a scale three times as large as the other <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>and<br/>
accompanied by three dogs and a man with sandals, bearing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">staff</span>.<br/>
In the 4th row from below, on a level with the head and shoulders<br/>
of this huge figure, is represented a curious procession. Neferhotep,<br/>
the secretary, and another Egyptian lead towards the governor a<br/>
number of foreign people in <span style="color: #ff0000;">gayucoloured </span>garments, whose sharply<br/>
out <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">getting</span>, hooked noses, and pointed beards unmistakeably proclaim their Semitic nationality. This Asiatic visit seems to have<br/>
been one of the signal events in the life of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nomarch</span>. Neferhotep<br/>
hands his master a document from which we learn that the strangers<br/>
knock ed at the door of Egypt in the 9th year of king <span style="color: #ff0000;">Userwsen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Prime </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Abaha</span>, the leader of the foreigners, leads <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>gazelle and bows<br/>
to the ground. The next Asiatic leads an <span style="color: #0000FF;">antelope</span>. Four armed men<br/>
march in front of the harem, which consists of four women and three<br/>
children. Two of these ride upon an ass, which also bears <span style="color: #0000FF;">implements </span>for weaving. The women wear brightly coloured <span style="color: #0000FF;">raiment </span>of<br/>
a curious <span style="color: #0000FF;">out</span>. The clothes and <span style="color: #0000FF;">loin-cloths </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ef </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tho </span>men are also<br/>
brilliantly coloured. A heavily-laden ass is followed by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">late </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">player </span>and a warrior armed with club, bow, and quiver<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The inscription, beginning above the figure of the secretary Neferhotep,<br/>
is as follows:'Arrival of those bringing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eye-sale </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mestem </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">kobi<br/>
