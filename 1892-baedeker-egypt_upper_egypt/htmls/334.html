<br/>
</span>The name Sun means'the place affording an opening or entrance', because<br/>
here the threshold of Egypt was crossed. The name seldom occurs in<br/>
hieroglyphic inscriptions, because the metropolis or chief town of the<br/>
name to which Sun belonged, was Elephantine, on the island of that<br/>
name. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>place, however, is very ancient, for even under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">am </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>,<br/>
the granite required by the builders of Lower Egypt was furnished by the<br/>
quarries in its neighbourhood. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>later times the city of the cataracts<br/>
was frequently referred to by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Greek </span>and Roman writers under the name<br/>
of Syene. It acquired special fame on account of its well (see below),<br/>
and as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lace </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>banishment of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Juvenal </span>in his old <span style="color: #ff0000;">age.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wag </span>of Syene, in which there was no shadow at midday, and which<br/>
thus seemed to prove that Syene was situated under the tropic, has <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lieu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">geared</span>. The report <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>existence led <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">learned </span>Athenian Eratosthenes (<span style="color: #0000FF;">27 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">198313</span>.), attached to the Museum at Alexandria, to the discovery of the<br/>
method of measuring the size of the earth that is still employed.'He<br/>
selected the are of the earth between Alexandria and Syene (<span style="color: #0000FF;">decade</span>) on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nils</span>, of which place he assumed that it was in the same meridian.<br/>
Since he knew that the midday sun at the summer solstice cast no shadow<br/>
within a radius of 300 stadia from Syene, and that in Alexandria at the<br/>
same time the angle determined by the shadow of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-gunmen </span>was<br/>
equal to one-fiftieth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>circle, <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>correctly concluded that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">distance<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>Alexandria and Syene must equal the fiftieth part of a meridian<br/>
circle, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">T</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>The distance from Alexandria to Syene was taken by<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Eratosthcnes </span>simply at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">501mm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eolimate </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">won </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mam </span>equal to<br/>

shows that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuiin </span>no longer lies under the tropic of Cancer, but somewhat<br/>
to the N. of it, so that no shadowless well can exist there at present;<br/>
but it has been calculated that in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ith </span>cent. B.C. Syene actually <span style="color: #0000FF;">lay<br/>
</span>exactly under the tropic, whence we may gather that the Egyptians must<br/>
have noticed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">shadowless </span>well long before Eratosthenes and must have<br/>
known the true situation of the tropic.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Juvenal </span>was still living under Hadrian; but it is not quite certain<br/>
whether, as is usually assumed, he was sent to Egypt by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Domitian </span>The<br/>
rhetorician and <span style="color: #0000FF;">satirist</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>while living in Rome, had <span style="color: #0000FF;">fiercely </span>attacked the<br/>
actor Paris, who was a <span style="color: #0000FF;">court-favourite</span>, and he was on that account removed<br/>
from the capital. He was not exactly banished but appointed prefect of<br/>
the garrison at Syene, on the most remote frontier of the empire. His<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">trenchant </span>muse found abundant material on the banks of the Nile. His<br/>
15th Satire describes the contest between the inhabitants of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombos </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tentyra </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Denderah</span>) at a festival at Koptos. The two hostile names, whom<br/>
he erroneously <span style="color: #0000FF;">calls </span>neighbours <span style="color: #ff0000;">CvieMois0</span>, had long cherished a mutual<br/>
enmity on account of the gods they worship <span style="color: #0000FF;">red</span>. At Tentyra the crocodile<br/>
was persecuted, while it was held sacred at <span style="color: #ff0000;">entyra </span>for the sake of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebek<br/>
</span>who was worshipped there. Thus arose a strife resembling that mentioned<br/>
on p. 7. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tentyritians </span>even <span style="color: #0000FF;">slew </span>a man of <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lichen </span>and devoured him<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Juvenal is indignant, and indicates that his residence on the Nile had by<br/>
no means taught him to love the Egyptians. If he composed the 15th<br/>
satire at Syene, that town has the honour of being the birth-place of the<br/>
following fine verses<span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'That </span>nature gave the <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span>man a feeling heart"<br/>
<br/>
'She proves herself, by giving him tears <span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>'This is the noblest part of all human nature'<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">lat</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Same</span>, in which Egypt is again mentioned, seems to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">errOneously </span>ascribed to Juvenal. Doubts also attach to the authenticity of a<br/>
frequently quoted edict of the emperor Diocletian, ordering the Christian<br/>
