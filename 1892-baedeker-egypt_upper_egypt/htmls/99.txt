<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mendel</span>), they could have found no more suitable spot for a settlement<br/>
than the neighbourhood of Abydos, where the fertile W. bank of the Nile<br/>
expands and <span style="color: #0000FF;">esters </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span>cultivation and excellent <span style="color: #0000FF;">dwelling-aites</span>, removed<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>danger of inundation. This is the most ancient town in Egypt,<br/>
and its neighbour <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos </span>cannot have been much younger, for even in<br/>
the time of the early empire it is frequently spoken of as a holy<br/>
city. It possessed the most famous grave of Osiris, of which it was<br/>
believed that burial in its vicinity or consecration in its sanctuary went<br/>
far in ensuring a favourable <span style="color: #0000FF;">judgment </span>in the world to <span style="color: #ff0000;">some</span>. From an<br/>
early period the grandees of the land caused their mummies to be brought<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hither </span>- <span style="color: #0000FF;">often</span>, however, for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">limited </span>time only, directing that, as soon<br/>
as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wished-for </span>blessings had been received from Osiris, the bodies<br/>
should be carried back to their ancestral <span style="color: #0000FF;">burial-grounds</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Mariette has<br/>
proved that the town itself (Egypt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Able</span>) was never of any great extent. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">extant </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ruins </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">extend </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Kherbeh </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. If, however, Abydos was small in the number<br/>
of its citizens, it was great through the importance of the gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">worshipped </span>in its temples. Each of the 42 names of Egypt possessed its<br/>
temple of Osiris; but none of them, except that of Sokar in Memphis,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">led </span>in sanctity that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abydos</span>. The testimony of the monuments is<br/>
confirmed by the classical writers. Herodotus left Upper Egypt undescribed, because <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hummus </span>had already treated of it, but we quote the<br/>
celebrated <span style="color: #0000FF;">passage </span>in which the trustworthy Strabo speaks of Abydos:<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">cAbove </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">it </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemai</span>'s) lies Abydos, the site of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memnoninm</span>, a wonderful<br/>
palace of stone, built in the manner of the Labyrinth, only <span style="color: #0000FF;">somewhat<br/>
</span>less elaborate in its complexity<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Below the Memnonium is a spring,<br/>
reached by passages with low vaults consisting of a single <span style="color: #0000FF;">atone </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>prominent by their extent and mode of construction. This spring is<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">connected </span>with the Nile by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>canal, which flows through a grove of<br/>
Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">thorn-assets</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, sacred to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apone</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos </span>seems once to have been<br/>
a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">cam </span>second only to Thebes, but now it is a small place, etc.'<br/>
Abydos is also mentioned by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pinter-ch</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Athenaeus</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Stephanos </span>of Byzantium,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mommy</span>, Pliny, and others. Ammianus <span style="color: #ff0000;">Marcellinns </span>speaks of the oracle<br/>
of the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Base</span>, which flourished here.<br/>
<br/>
The ordinary traveller, especially when he has at his disposal<br/>
only the 8 hrs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>allowed by the steamer, will <span style="color: #0000FF;">confine </span>himself to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium </span>of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>. (Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>) <span style="color: #ff0000;">at'Artrtrat </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e1-hiadft1neh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">end </span>the sadly<br/>
dilapidated Temple of Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">H. </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span>). The remains of the<br/>
so-called Temple of Osiris at <span style="color: #ff0000;">ethhcrbeh </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>) and the adjacent<br/>
site<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Marlette</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>excavations in the ancient <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis </span>among the<br/>
Libyan hills are rapidly becoming less and less interesting through<br/>
<br/>
the steady encroachment of the desert sand.<br/>

<br/>
</span>This noble structure<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which, from the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Strabo </span>onwards, has<br/>
been visited and described by so many travellers, did not become <span style="color: #0000FF;">fully<br/>
</span>known to the modern world till Mariette Bey, with characteristic <span style="color: #0000FF;">judgment </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">erseverance </span>and supported by the generosity of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">began </span>in 1 the task of freeing it from the sand. His plan of isolating<br/>
the building by digging a trench round and preventing new <span style="color: #0000FF;">accumulation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of sand was not carried wholly into <span style="color: #ff0000;">chest</span>, but still, with the exception of portion of the outside of the N. wall of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>court,<br/>
there is now no part <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the temple where inscriptions are likely to<br/>
be found that does not stand open to the explorer. The difficulty of the<br/>
excavations was much <span style="color: #0000FF;">increased </span>by the fact that the back part of <span style="color: #0000FF;">me<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">temple </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wu </span>buried in the slope of the hill, in such away that it looked<br/>
like a gigantic <span style="color: #ff0000;">sepnlchral </span>chapel forming the vestibule to a mighty <span style="color: #ff0000;">rocktomb </span>in the bowels of the mountain. Mariette <span style="color: #0000FF;">believes</span>, and probably<br/>
with justice, that this peculiarity of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">bismnoninm </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">paplains </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name<br/>
