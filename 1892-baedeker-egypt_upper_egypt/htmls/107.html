<span><span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span>Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">f</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>ABYDOS. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Second <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hypostyle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Room </span>(Pl. D) resembles the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first</span>, but is<br/>
higher, deeper, and in all respects of more importance. Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>began it and his artists executed both the architectural details and<br/>
the plastic adornment with the carefulness and purity of style that<br/>
marks all their work. The son has here left unchanged the name<br/>
of the father, which occurs at every point. Three rows of twelve<br/>
columns each support the architrave, on which rest the roofing<br/>
slabs, and are arranged in <span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>groups, each of six columns. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bow<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tween </span>the groups access is <span style="color: #0000FF;">afforded </span>to the vaulted chambers in the<br/>
wall facing us as we enter. The first two of the three rows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">col</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">urns </span>have papyrus-bud capitals. Beyond the second row the floor of<br/>
the temple is considerably raised, forming a platform from which<br/>
the vaulted chambers are entered<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Upon this platform stands the<br/>
third row of columns, the cylindrical shafts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are entirely<br/>
destitute of capitals, but bear huge blocks of stone forming an <span style="color: #0000FF;">abacus </span>for the support of the architrave. This peculiarity is simply <span style="color: #0000FF;">explained </span>by the fact that the columns in the third row are shorter<br/>
than the others, owing to their raised platform, so that the architect,<br/>
by omitting the capital, brings the abacus of all on the same level<br/>
and avoids the unpleasant <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span>which <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>elevations of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave </span>would make on the eye<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>When processions of worshippers<br/>
filed in and out, performing pious ceremonies, this hall must have<br/>
presented a very imposing spectacle. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Inscriptions </span>below the <span style="color: #0000FF;">openings </span>leading from the first hall to the second inform us they were<br/>
formerly filled with doors of bronze (<span style="color: #0000FF;">seam</span>). The inscriptions and<br/>
representations on the walls and columns repeat themselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">wearisomely </span>and are of little general interest<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Here we see the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">receiving </span>from the gods such attributes of the royal dignity as the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">crooked </span>sword or the scourge and crook (symbols, perhaps, of the<br/>
royal duties of incentive on the one side and restraint on the other);<br/>
there we behold him <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">burnt-offerings </span>to a single god, a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">triad</span>, or a group of gods. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>the king is receiving gifts, he is<br/>
generally represented on his knees; when he <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices</span>, he leans<br/>
slightly forward, holding the <span style="color: #0000FF;">burnt-offering </span>in the left hand and<br/>
libations in the right. Sometimes he is seated, receiving the <span style="color: #0000FF;">blessings </span>of the gods; he appears thus in the fine picture on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>Wall<br/>
of the second room, with Isis, Amenti, and Nephthys in front, and<br/>
the goddess Ma <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Renpet <span style="color: #0000FF;">behind</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>His <span style="color: #ff0000;">profile </span>is evidently a faithful likeness and is everywhere portrayed with great artistic skill.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">unusual </span>handsomeness of this king is still recognisable in his<br/>
mummy at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>implements should also be noted.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Camera </span>like that in his hand have been found, but in bronze, while<br/>
his were doubtless of gold<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>They are in the form of an arm, the<br/>
hand holding a small vessel from which the smoke of the incense<br/>
arises. The handle shows the <span style="color: #0000FF;">carefully </span>executed sparrow <span style="color: #ff0000;">hawk's<br/>
</span>head of Horus. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">libatiou </span>vessel was in the form of a golden <span style="color: #0000FF;">low<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tus </span>flower, with small vases rising above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">open </span>corolla, from <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
