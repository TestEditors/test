the sacred boat', <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'sanctuary'i</span>. Here the lord of Egypt alone<br/>
is depicted. He, the living type of the beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home</span>, the son of<br/>
the sun, the child of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather </span>(as the Pharaoh is frequently named<br/>
in this temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather</span>), the visible representative of the deity,<br/>
and as ruler of Egypt the incorporation of all the temporal interests<br/>
of the state, <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>it was alone, to judge from the representations and<br/>
inscriptions, whose sacred person might enter the holy of holies and<br/>
in solitude commune with the deity. Only once a year was this<br/>
permitted even to him, at the great festival of the New Year. We<br/>
here see the monarch opening the door of the sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">cella</span>, closed<br/>
with a sealed band of byblos. He breaks the seal and removes the<br/>
strip <span style="color: #0000FF;">of- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">byblos </span>(sash <span style="color: #ff0000;">tebtn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">other </span>atom), he places his hands in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span>rings on the door and thrusts back the bolts, ascends the<br/>
steps leading to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cella</span>, and finally gazes upon the hidden figure<br/>
of the goddess, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offers </span>his homage. Other designs exhibit the<br/>
monarch performing the prescribed ceremonies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>incense<br/>
before the two sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">boats </span>of Hathor and her companion, Home of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Edfn</span>, and before the boats of Isis and her companion Osiris. The<br/>
portable boats (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Transfers</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span>.'the bearers of beauties'), which are<br/>
here depicted on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-walls</span>, formerly stood in Room A, and<br/>
held the shrines in which were the sacred images of the deities.<br/>
The shrines were carried in solemn processions by the priests,<br/>
sometimes without the <span style="color: #0000FF;">boats</span>, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">e.g</span>. at the new year's festival <span style="color: #0000FF;">rev<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">presented </span>on the staircase (p. 91), and sometimes standing in the<br/>
boats.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sidc~rooms </span>of the Adytum are, as mentioned above, entered<br/>
from corridor <span style="color: #ff0000;">d. </span>Behind the Adytum, to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">5.</span>, lies No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, the<br/>
Large Chamber, the largest and most sacred of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-rooms</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>The sanctity of this chamber is evidenced by the painting, in which<br/>
the king is portrayed exactly as in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Adytum </span>itself, ascending the<br/>
steps to the shrine of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather</span>, breaking the seal, and opening the<br/>
doors, grasping the handles in his hands<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Noteworthy also are the<br/>
representations of the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vases </span>of wine to Hathor and<br/>
to Ahi, her son, in each case followed by a harp-playing goddess of<br/>
the north and of the south. Two other pictures represent Pepi, the<br/>
original builder of the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>81), kneeling before Hathor,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">bearing </span>Ahi in his hands, and the later builder with a mirror before<br/>
the goddess in a double shrine. The inscriptions give the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dimensions </span>of these images and state that they were made of gold, <span style="color: #ff0000;">so </span>that<br/>
