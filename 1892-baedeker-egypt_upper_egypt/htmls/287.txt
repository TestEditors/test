</span>a few tombs at <span style="color: #0000FF;">elu- </span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">usually </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">visited </span>by the ordinary traveller.<br/>
Some belong to the 18th and 19th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>, but the most important<br/>
are of the 26th. Broken walls seem to indicate that the cemetery<br/>
was divided into sections. We also <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>here various <span style="color: #0000FF;">brick </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">buildings </span>and a large arched doorway<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>During Mariette's excavations<br/>
many mummies were found<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>not in regular tombs, but either in the<br/>
earth itself, or in small vaults 3 to 6 ft. below the surface. In some<br/>
of them, <span style="color: #ff0000;">papyruswrolls </span>of great value were discovered. The tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Petmenap </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cl </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">S</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>is larger than Nos<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>14 and <span style="color: #ff0000;">17<br/>

<br/>
</span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Blbin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Muluk</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>worth a <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit </span>on account of its great size<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Petamenap </span>was a prince of the empire and an <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>of the 26th<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Dyan</span>, whose remarkable position entitled him to the unusual honour<br/>
of completing buildings at the temple of Medinet-Habu, and of<br/>
placing his name upon them. The tomb is cut out of remarkably<br/>
beautiful limestone; and its inscriptions display the neatness of<br/>
finish which is peculiar to the sculptures of the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">renais-n<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sauce</span>. It has become the home of thousands of bats, which render<br/>
the attempt to copy the inscriptions in the inner rooms very <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult<br/>
</span>by constantly extinguishing the light. The smell, moreover, which<br/>
they cause is so strong and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offensive </span>that a thorough inspection of<br/>
the tomb is recommended only to those who can overcome the feeling of nausea. Any one who is subject to giddiness should avoid<br/>
going far into the tomb, as in the middle it is necessary to balance<br/>
oneself, though only for a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">steps</span>, along a narrow path on the<br/>
edge of a deep shaft. Sir Gardner Wilkinson undertook the measurement of the tomb, and the inscriptions have been almost completely<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">copied </span>and partly published by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diimichen</span>. These are important<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>for the details of the funeral ceremonies.<br/>
<br/>
The entrance, as in almost all the tombs in this part of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">noose </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">polio</span>, is by an open courtyard without walls, 103 ft. wide by <span style="color: #0000FF;">63 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>deep, and its roof<br/>
is supported by two rows of pillars. All the walls are ornamented with<br/>
inscriptions and reliefs carefully executed, but <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>unfortunately much<br/>
injured and blackened. These, almost without exception, refer to the fate<br/>
of the soul in the lower world. <span style="color: #ff0000;">~</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>A vaulted <span style="color: #0000FF;">Corridor </span>leads into a second<br/>
large Room (<span style="color: #0000FF;">53 </span>ft. by <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n.</span>) in which 8 pillars remain to prevent the <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof<br/>
</span>from falling, while in the Room adjoining it, 32% <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>square, only 4 have<br/>
been spared. A Chamber with niches (<span style="color: #0000FF;">'21 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t. </span>by 12 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>) concludes this <span style="color: #0000FF;">series<br/>
</span>of rooms, the total length of which together with the courtyard is 312 <span style="color: #0000FF;">n.<br/>
</span>The nature of the stone having apparently prevented further advance into<br/>
the rock in this direction, the masons turned to the left and dug out a<br/>
wide Hall, and also to the right, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>successive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Passages </span>were<br/>
made at right angles leading to a small room. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Those </span>not being on the<br/>
same level were connected by flights of res <span style="color: #ff0000;">ctively </span>9, 23, and 9 steps.<br/>
In the small room mentioned is a shaft <span style="color: #ff0000;">it</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>deep with a chamber.<br/>
Caution is necessary here. This series of <span style="color: #0000FF;">usages </span>in length.<br/>
From the room containing the shaft a <span style="color: #ff0000;">rridor </span>runs again to the<br/>
right, and leads to a transverse Chamber, making <span style="color: #ff0000;">so </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>in this direction<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>However, before reaching the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nap</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>line, we find <span style="color: #0000FF;">leading<br/>
</span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>shaft a fourth set of passages to the right, <span style="color: #0000FF;">125 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">straight </span>direction. Adjoining this on the left is <span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lorg </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t8 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
