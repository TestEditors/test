</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ita-nub-kau </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">FiiiFl </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>created <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnumhotep </span>governor of<br/>
the E. names, and as the heir of his maternal grandfather made<br/>
him priest of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>and Pasht <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Monet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnfu </span>(Minyeh).<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">portion </span>or vestibule of this tomb deserves particular attention, as it not only possesses <span style="color: #0000FF;">proto-Dorie </span>columns resembling those<br/>
of Tomb i, but also shows some architectural forms, which seem<br/>
intended to reproduce the beams and rafters of buildings above<br/>
ground. The cornice projects strongly above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave </span>and<br/>
is supported by fine lathe hewn, like all the rest of the structure,<br/>
out of the living rock. The resemblance of these lathe to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">11111-tnlcs </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorie </span>order is not especially striking in itself, but taken<br/>
in conjunction with other points of <span style="color: #0000FF;">similarity </span>is, perhaps, worthy of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mention</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- The interior of Khnumhotep's tomb is richly adorned<br/>
with paintings<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Most of the representations were painted on a thin<br/>
layer of stucco, with which the limestone <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>were coated. At the<br/>
foot, however, is a long inscription <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>in the rock, in lines <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>greenish colour, 21/2 ft. high. [ In 1890 the royal names were out<br/>
out of the rock by some vandal hand and <span style="color: #ff0000;">shared </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">sale </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>] From this<br/>
inscription we receive information about the family of Khnumhotep,<br/>
who owed the greater part of his dignities to his maternal grandfather, about his relations with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amenemha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, who, at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">intercession </span>of his mother, made him a royal governor, and about the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">benefits </span>he had conferred on his government and its people and the<br/>
honour he had done to the gods of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span>and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">manor </span>of his<br/>
forefathers. <span style="color: #ff0000;">5<br/>
<br/>
</span>The paintings have unfortunately <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffered </span>so much in the last<br/>
30 or 40 years, that the subjects of some of them are now almost<br/>
indistinguishable. Most of them, however, were <span style="color: #ff0000;">cepied </span>by Lepsius,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Bosellini</span>, Wilkinson, and others, while they were <span style="color: #0000FF;">still </span>in fair <span style="color: #0000FF;">preservation</span>; and they have furnished most important contributions to<br/>
our knowledge of the private life of the ancient Egyptians<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the<br/>
uppermost row of paintings, above the door, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented </span>the<br/>
festival of the opening of the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khnumhotep</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>'The heaven<br/>
opens', says the inscription,'as the god (<span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span>. the deceased <span style="color: #0000FF;">tank<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">formed </span>into Osiris) steps forth'. To the right, lower down, we see<br/>
the colonnades of Khnumhotep's dwelling, with servants measuring<br/>
and registering his treasures and (farther on) bringing his corn into<br/>
the barns. Two of the lower rows show the operations of ploughing,<br/>
harvesting, and threshing. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Still </span>lower down is a Nile-boat, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hearing </span>the mummy of the deceased, as the inscription informs us, to<br/>
Abydos <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the grave of Osiris), while the <span style="color: #0000FF;">high-priest </span>imparts his<br/>
blessing. Below is a representation of the vintage and of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gathering </span>of fruit and vegetables. The cattle in the water and the fishing<br/>
scene (at the foot) vividly recall the similar scenes in the Mastaba<br/>
of Ti<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>To the left of the door, high up, are seen the processes of<br/>
preparing clay for pottery and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sewing </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">wood</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">in </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">second </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">row<br/>
