</span>more recent. The inscriptions usually give the name of the deceased<br/>
and the date of death. Texts from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karin </span>are not uncommon,<br/>
in spite of the Prophet's express command that the name of God and<br/>
passages from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kor'an </span>should never be placed upon tombstones.<br/>
The tombs of the richer dead are small domed erections. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the<br/>
summit of the hill to the right of the road are some large <span style="color: #ff0000;">mosquelike </span>Cenotaphs, dedicated to famous saints, <span style="color: #0000FF;">such </span>as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shékh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mahu<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mild</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shiikh'All</span>, our lady (<span style="color: #0000FF;">sine</span>) Zeinab, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>, whose memory<br/>
is celebrated by festivals on their birthdays, etc.<br/>

3. <span style="color: #0000FF;">TILE </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">vams </span>(Arabic <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maudie</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>About 1/4 hr. beyond <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuan </span>we quit the road <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>turn to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>(left). In a few minutes more we reach the verge of a hill, on<br/>
which blocks of granite are scattered both singly and <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>heaps. A<br/>
moderately lofty <span style="color: #0000FF;">slid </span>beyond shows manifold traces of the industry<br/>
of the ancient builders, who, from the erection of the pyramids to<br/>
the time of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemios</span>, drew their supplies of granite from the<br/>
quarries of Syene. Almost all the granite pillars, columns, <span style="color: #ff0000;">archivtrayes</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">roof-slabs</span>, obelisks, and statues that we have hitherto seen<br/>
in Egypt, hail from this spot.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Syenite </span>owes its name to the early Greek form of the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aswan<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Erase</span>), although the stone here found is far too poor in hornblende to<br/>
be reckoned true syenite at all.+ <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hormone </span>describes it as <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>The granite, which interrupts the sandstone at the cataracts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">heroin</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>of a reddish <span style="color: #0000FF;">hue</span>, caused by bright <span style="color: #0000FF;">rose-coloured </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">orthoclase</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>It <span style="color: #0000FF;">contains </span>a large proportion of translucent quartz, yellow, brownish, pink, and<br/>
black <span style="color: #0000FF;">mica</span>, and only a little hornblende. Huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">coarse-grained </span>masses of<br/>
this composition are here found and also hard <span style="color: #0000FF;">tine-grained </span>masses, containing much red felspar, but little quartz and very little mica. Veins<br/>
also <span style="color: #0000FF;">own </span>rich in <span style="color: #0000FF;">dark </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mica </span>and greenish oligoclase, and containing a<br/>
little pinite; and finally veins of a dark green diorite, in which the proportion of hornblende is much greater than that of albite'. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">glaze<br/>
</span>on the rocks of the cataracts is noticed on p. 279.<br/>
<br/>
The diligent hands of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">« </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cutters </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Pharaohs have left<br/>
distinct traces behind them. The method in which the blocks were<br/>
quarried in tiers may still be distinctly seen on a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliff </span>facing the<br/>
N, about <span style="color: #ff0000;">8mim </span>to the NE. of the town. The skill with which huge<br/>
masses were handled and detached without injury from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cliff </span>to<br/>
which they belonged, is absolutely marvellous. The certainty of the<br/>
process <span style="color: #0000FF;">adopted </span>is amply vouched for by the fact that obelisks were<br/>
completely finished on three sides before they were <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">detached<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>t This curious fact is <span style="color: #0000FF;">explained </span>by Prof. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Zirkel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The term<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">swam</span>, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">mum </span>in Pliny, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>employed in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>sense<br/>
by Werner in 1788, who applied it to the characteristic <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone </span>formed of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">orthoclase </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">felspar </span>and black hornblende, found in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Plauensche </span>Grand,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sammy</span>. Thenceforth that mineral was accepted as the typical <span style="color: #0000FF;">syenite</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Wed </span>subsequently proved that the stone quarried at Syene was not<br/>
syenite at all, <span style="color: #ff0000;">he</span>. that its formation was quite <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>from that of the<br/>
rocks in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Plaurxnsche </span>Grand. When <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rosier-e </span>discovered true <span style="color: #0000FF;">syenite </span>on<br/>
Mount Sinai he proposed to alter its name slightly and to call it Steam,<br/>
a suggestion, however, which has never been <span style="color: #0000FF;">adopted</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
