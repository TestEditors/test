We may mention here in anticipation that the roof of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">following </span>hypostyle hall was supported by a perfect forest of <span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-bud<br/>
</span>columns, through the midst of which a broad passage was marked<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-columns</span>, closely resembling the detached pairs of columns<br/>
in the first court (comp. p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">120 </span>At this point we <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>obtain a<br/>
clear idea of the arrangement of this portion of the temple, and the<br/>
same <span style="color: #0000FF;">remark </span>applies also to all the rooms between it and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mary</span>. It should also be remembered that the number of those<br/>
privileged to follow and behold the procession gradually decreased<br/>
from room to room as the sanctuary was approached<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>Headed by<br/>
the king or chief priest, the crowd of priests, <span style="color: #ff0000;">bearing </span>the standards,<br/>
symbols, and images of the gods, passed through the doorway of the<br/>
first pylon into the peristyle court. The double row of <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">capitals </span>served at once to indicate their passage and to mark the<br/>
limits beyond which the pious spectators must not press. The<br/>
sacred procession rolled on slowly beneath the shade of the velarium<br/>
and entered the hypostyle hall through the second pylon. Many of<br/>
those who were permitted to enter the first court had there to quit<br/>
the procession and to take up their positions to the right and left<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Others again were not permitted to advance<br/>
farther than the hypostyle, and so with each room until the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sauce<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tuary </span>was reached. To this day the clearly defined passage thither<br/>
may be traced, and it will be observed that at each successive stage<br/>
the place appointed for those who had to quit the procession is<br/>
smaller than the preceding.<br/>
