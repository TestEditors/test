<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tions</span>, the inscription continues as follows, with special reference to<br/>
this temple:'For lo, while the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-ma-men </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span>. Seti I.)<br/>
was still building both <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span>and front<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>Seti ascended to heaven,<br/>
before his <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium </span>(Mennu) was completed. The columns had<br/>
not yet been placed upon their bases, the statue lay on the ground<br/>
and was not yet finished <span style="color: #0000FF;">off</span>, when he (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Set</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span>) became acquainted<br/>
with the tomb <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>the'golden room', the principal chamber of Seti's<br/>
tomb at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Biban </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Mulino</span>, etc. Then said His Majesty to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bearer </span>by his side: Summon the courtiers, the military commanders,<br/>
and their fellows, and also the whole multitude of architects and<br/>
librarians. When these were conducted before His Majesty, pressing<br/>
their noses in the dust and their knees to the earth, they broke out<br/>
into rejoicing and smelled the ground (<span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>prostrated themselves).<br/>
They raised their arms, praising His Majesty, and prayed to this<br/>
benignant deity, celebrating his perfection'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Then follow emphatic<br/>
expressions of worship, addressed to the king.'Then spoke His<br/>
Majesty unto them and said: I summoned you before me on account<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>plan that has entered my mind. I have seen the buildings of<br/>
the necropolis and the tombs that are at Abydos, and also those<br/>
who have to work there. Truly nothing has been restored since the<br/>
time of their lord unto the present day. But when a son <span style="color: #0000FF;">finds </span>himself on the throne of his father, shall he not renew the monument<br/>
(Mennu) of his begetter?<span style="color: #0000FF;">... </span>From childhood until now I have<br/>
been a prince. He gave me the earth as a gift, and while I was yet<br/>
in the egg the great ones of the earth prostrated themselves before<br/>
me. <span style="color: #ff0000;">o.. </span>I have called my father to a new life in gold (<span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span>. as a<br/>
statue) in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>year of my <span style="color: #0000FF;">exaltation</span>. I have given <span style="color: #0000FF;">orders </span>that<br/>
his temple be adorned and I have made sure his possession of the<br/>
land<span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>I have <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>him <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices</span>.... And <span style="color: #ff0000;">new</span>, when his<br/>
building stood in my power, I watched over all the labours connected<br/>
with it.... I enlarged and renewed his palatial <span style="color: #0000FF;">structure </span>I did<br/>
not neglect his <span style="color: #0000FF;">foundation</span>, as wicked children do, who do not<br/>
respect their father... I built <span style="color: #0000FF;">anew </span>the walls of the temple of<br/>
my begetter. I presented before him the man whom I had selected<br/>
to superintend the works... I erected pylons in front of it, I have<br/>
covered his house with clothing (sculptures)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>l have adorned its<br/>
columns and provided stones for the foundations. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>work<br/>
was the monument, doubly as glorious as at first. It is (named) after<br/>
my name and after the name of my father, for, as the son, so is also<br/>
the father'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the following sentences Ramses is praised as a model<br/>
son and the highest gifts of the gods are assured to him.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Since </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-god </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>there has never been a son who has accomplished what<br/>
thou hast<span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Thou, thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">workest</span>, thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">renewest </span>one monument<br/>
to the gods after another, according to the command of thy father<br/>
Ra'. The whole world obeys him and brings him <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings</span>. After<br/>
the grandees have <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>their oration, he once more orders the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, masters, artists, labourers, and all <span style="color: #ff0000;">otherpmngagefiin </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
