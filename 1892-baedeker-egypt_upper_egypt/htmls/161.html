<span>106 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">THEBES</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>History.<br/>
<br/>
of which tombs have been found, is open to question. Hardly any<br/>
traces of earlier monuments have been discovered. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>earliest<br/>
prosperity of Thebes dates from the eclipse of the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourishing </span>period of Memphis. Previously it was named the southern On,<br/>
in distinction to Heliopolis, the northern On. A legend, known<br/>
to us, however, only <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>inscriptions of a later date, narrates that<br/>
Osiris was <span style="color: #0000FF;">how </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hem </span>Such a myth can scarcely have been invented<br/>
in later times, for from the beginning of the New Empire onwards,<br/>
Osiris fell into a position quite subsidiary to the other gods of Thebes,<br/>
especially to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-Ra </span>with whom <span style="color: #0000FF;">Math </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsn </span>formed a<br/>
triad<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Only in connection with the worship of the dead did Osiris<br/>
retain his leading rank. Among goddesses <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Hathor seems to have<br/>
enjoyed especial honour <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the earliest times; and even till a <span style="color: #0000FF;">comparatively </span>late date the <span style="color: #ff0000;">noose </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Phathyritcs </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">{ </span>the Pathros of the Bible),<br/>
of which Thebes was the flourishing capital, <span style="color: #0000FF;">wax</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mallet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>after her the<br/>
'Hathor district<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>. Under the early empire the afterwards gigantic city<br/>
was not conspicuous. It is seldom mentioned, and even under the<br/>
13th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Aoithy-Lyeopovts </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>31) is described as the chief town of<br/>
Upper <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hen </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">invadedthe </span>Nile valley, the legitimate<br/>
princes, who had ruled from the Mediterranean to the Cataracts, were<br/>
driven to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">south </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Hare </span>they reigned during several inglorious<br/>
centuries, until <span style="color: #ff0000;">llaskenen </span>and King Aahmes (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">asst</span>) arose and under<br/>
the banner of Ammon of Thebes expelled the strangers. The succeeding princes, won important victories not only on Egyptian soil but<br/>
also in Asia, always fighting under the auspices of Ammon with<br/>
whom was joined the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Re </span>of Lower Egypt, and who, as we have seen<br/>
(Vol. <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, p. 138), was speedily placed at the head of all the national<br/>
gods. The liberation of the country was directed from Thebes, and that<br/>
city continued for <span style="color: #ff0000;">centuriesto </span>be the favourite seat of the Pharaohs,<br/>
and the reservoir into which flowed the untold treasures <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>as<br/>
tribute or brought as booty from Asia to Egypt. A large share of this<br/>
wealth was bestowed upon Amman. The magnificent and gigantic<br/>
temple, erected at this period to the god, is still one of the chief<br/>
sights of Thebes. The grandees of the kingdom esteemed it an honour<br/>
to become priests of Ammon, the schools beside his temples flourished,<br/>
and the kings <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>their richest gifts to this god, from whom they<br/>
expected a surer fulfilment of their petitions than from any other<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Thus Thebes became the city <span style="color: #0000FF;">cinnamon</span>, the No or No-Amon of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Scripture </span>and the Diospolis of the Greeks. Victory over foes was the burden<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">everyiprayer </span>of the Pharaohs at this culminating period of Thebes,<br/>
and the warriors led out by the monarchs were drilled under the eye<br/>
of the god. In the introductory remarks on the history of Egypt<br/>
mention has already been made of the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">warrior-princes </span>who<br/>
placed Thebes at the zenith of its fame, and in the description of<br/>
the various monuments reference will again <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>made to them. Here<br/>
it may <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>added that the fame of the huge city early reached the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">can</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>even of the Greeks. In a possibly interpolated passage of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
