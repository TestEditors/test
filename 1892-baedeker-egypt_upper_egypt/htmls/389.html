<br/>
</span>divided into three apartments. A door leads to the outside from<br/>
each side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>apartment. Behind the temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">proper</span>, which<br/>
is only 42 <span style="color: #0000FF;">n. </span>long, is a small recess hewn in the rock, and adorned<br/>
on the outside. The N. and S. outside walls of the temple are also<br/>
sculptured.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">81/</span>, a place<br/>
mentioned in the Itinerarium Antonini<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>Roman miles, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.c</span>. 18<br/>
Eng ]. M., above Talmis (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kalabsheh</span>). The sacred name of this<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">C'Zl<br/>
</span>place was Pa Ptah, the House of Ptah. The pylon, of which<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gen </span>and Champollion saw traces in front of the rock-temple, has<br/>
disappeared, having been washed away by the stream. The word <span style="color: #0000FF;">gerf<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cisar </span>means, in fact, a bank washed away by a stream. Several<br/>
<br/>
sphinxes, with small statues of the king, still remain, forming an<br/>
avenue from the river-bank to the temple. Next to the pylon was a<br/>
Vestibule, built outside the hill, while the temple proper is hewn<br/>
in the rock. In this vestibule two columns to the left are still<br/>
standing (the two to the right have disappeared), and seven of the<br/>
original eight pillars, with somewhat clumsy Osiris-statues. The<br/>
last bear on their shoulders the name of Ramses 11., who built this<br/>
temple and is the only king mentioned in it. He appears not only<br/>
as the founder, but also as one of the deities to be worshipped here.<br/>
On the beams of the architrave he is named with both his names as<br/>
lord of the festivals like his father Ptah, as the ruler of Egypt<br/>
and conqueror of his foes (expressed pictorially). The next room<br/>
(45 ft. square), hewn out of the rock, requires artificial light; it<br/>
produces a serious and gloomy <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. The ceiling is supported by<br/>
six Osiris-pillars, 28 ft. high, representing the king as Osiris, with<br/>
the crown on his <span style="color: #ff0000;">head</span>, his crossed arms bearing the signs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">rule<br/>
