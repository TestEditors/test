<br/>
scanty relics of the earliest recognizable buildings of the temple of<br/>
the 12th Dynasty. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Farther </span>on, in the axis of the sanctuary, are two<br/>
square granite bases, one behind the other, being the <span style="color: #0000FF;">relics </span>of<br/>
sixteen-sided columns, with the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Usertesen </span>I. A little<br/>
farther to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>is the doorway of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Great </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnade </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tubman </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ULUPI</span>. H). The reports <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>military success <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofthis </span>prince, which we have <span style="color: #0000FF;">just </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">perused</span>, telling us of the<br/>
enormous wealth at his disposal, and still more the reverence which<br/>
we see him paying to Amman at every turn, prepare us to find in<br/>
this temple some important building reared by him to his divine<br/>
patron<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The space to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>of the ancient sanctuary had already<br/>
been occupied by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>of his ancestors, so that, as his new<br/>
building was also to maintain connection with the holy place, he<br/>
was forced to build on the site to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span>We have already seen<br/>
how, contrary to the usual custom, he provided the sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">granite-chamber </span>with a second doorway (opening to the E.<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>The form and<br/>
appearance of the courts and chambers that lay between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sauce<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">teary </span>and the colonnade cannot now be determined, for they have<br/>
been utterly destroyed. The ancient holy place built by the kings<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish </span>Dyn. was probably surrounded by two concentric walls,<br/>
separated by an archway or passage. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnaded </span>hall, which<br/>
we enter by the central door, is 144 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft </span>wide and <span style="color: #0000FF;">52 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft. </span>deep. The<br/>
roof was supported <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20 </span>columns in two rows; while 32 square pillars (<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span>at the sides, <span style="color: #0000FF;">d </span>at the ends) formed four galleries with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>of the hall. The pillars, though not so <span style="color: #ff0000;">tall </span>as the columns, were<br/>
of the same height as the walls, and with the latter supported the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">roofing </span>slabs. As the middle of the hall was also roofed, a small<br/>
wall, with sloping exterior and decorated with the astragal and <span style="color: #0000FF;">concave </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cornice</span>, rose from the roof above the pillars and walls to the<br/>
height of the columns in the centre. There was thus formed a kind<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">clerestory</span>, which was provided with rectangular windows, broader<br/>
than they were high, in order to admit light to the hall. The central<br/>
columns belong to a peculiar order, the various parts of which on<br/>
the shaft and capital were indicated only by painting<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>They have<br/>
received the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">of'inoortcd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">culymncapituls</span>', because the <span style="color: #ff0000;">balls </span>or<br/>
calyces <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>placed <span style="color: #ff0000;">inserted </span>on the smooth shafts, which were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">painted </span>a dark red and adorned with vertical inscriptions, recalling<br/>
the similar decoration of the central panels of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluted </span>polygonal<br/>
columns. As the edge of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tlow-Irs </span>rested <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon </span>the end of the<br/>
shaft, the latter <span style="color: #0000FF;">expanded </span>at the top, with some abruptness; and<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">annuli </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">had</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in consequence to be placed somewhat low down<br/>
on the cylindrical shaft (below the beginning of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">expansion</span>),<br/>
to save them from the appearance of slipping down. The capitals<br/>
are adorned with <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx- </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">marshnplants</span>, the tips of which, of course,<br/>
point downwards. In place of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit-germ</span>, these inverted <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyces </span>support somewhat lofty <span style="color: #0000FF;">sheet</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>on which rests an <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave<br/>
</span>adorned with <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>hieroglyphics<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The fourth abacus <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ide<br/>
