<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>year, on the 10th Epiphi, in the reign <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>Majesty <span style="color: #0000FF;">ale</span>.... <span style="color: #ff0000;">RamsesMiamun</span>, who loves the <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>the father of the gods, his creator. Long<br/>
may he <span style="color: #0000FF;">live</span>, possessing <span style="color: #0000FF;">firmness </span>and might, eternally. Long live the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">beneficent </span>god, the Nile that loves the <span style="color: #0000FF;">primeval </span>waters (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Mum </span>the father<br/>
of the gods, who form the cycle of the nine deities, which belong to the<br/>
floods, the blessing, the abundance, the support of Egypt, who blesses<br/>
all the world with life by his rich abundance, who is dignified in his<br/>
course and distributes blessings with his fingers. The elect are rejoiced<br/>
at his approach. Thou art one that <span style="color: #0000FF;">best </span>created thyself, and no man<br/>
knows whence thou <span style="color: #0000FF;">an</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the day that thou <span style="color: #0000FF;">comest </span>out of thy surroundings, all the world rejoices. Thou art <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>lord of many <span style="color: #0000FF;">fishes </span>and<br/>
gifts, who <span style="color: #ff0000;">bestowest </span>nourishment upon Egypt. Even the nine deities<br/>
know not whence thou art. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thou </span>art their life<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Therefore when thou<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">approachest </span>they redouble their <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings</span>; they furnish the altars richly<br/>
and raise their voices in <span style="color: #ff0000;">sanitation </span>when thou <span style="color: #ff0000;">appearest</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Than </span>metest<br/>
rich measure to us, to nourish the elect, like <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span>when he ruled this land<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Strong and wakeful is he at all times, to seek nourishment for the living,<br/>
to make the corn abundant like the sand of the seashore, and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">land<br/>
</span>the granaries with gifts. Behold, therefore His Majesty <span style="color: #0000FF;">sought </span>how he<br/>
might exalt the father of all gods, the prince and ruler of the flood, and<br/>
meditated like the god Tehuti <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thoth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>to find out what was adequate to<br/>
his love (<span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>. how he might give most adequate expression to his love).<br/>
No king has done so since thy time, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">net </span>And His Majesty spoke:<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Whereas </span>the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">nourishes </span>the world, and blessing <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>abundance<br/>
follow upon his rising, and behold each one <span style="color: #0000FF;">liver</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>in his dwelling, enriched<br/>
through his command; and seeing that I know what stands in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bookstore </span>that is preserved in the library; therefore when the Nile comes<br/>
forth from his two sources, then let the offerings to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gone </span>be <span style="color: #ff0000;">im<br/>
</span>creased; but <span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>the holy stream is at Silsileh<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khennu-t</span>),<br/>

<span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
</span>at the right time, King Ramses II. will redouble the <span style="color: #0000FF;">shortage </span>to it there.<br/>
<br/>
This king appointed two festivals to be kept at Silsileh in honour<br/>
of the Nile, as the following portion of the inscription records. One was<br/>
to be observed at the beginning of its gradual rise (the 15th Epiphi), the<br/>
other on the 15th Thoth, when the rapid rise set <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Stem </span>compares<br/>
these appropriately to the two main festivals of the modern Egyptians,<br/>
the Night of the Drop, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cutting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ofthe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dam</span>, which are also two months<br/>
apart (Vol. <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, p. 239). Merenptah <span style="color: #0000FF;">l. </span>and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">ill. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmed </span>the grants<br/>
made by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bosses </span>II. for the purposes of these festivals, and erected the <span style="color: #0000FF;">above'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mentioned </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Males </span>in commemoration of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fact </span>The nature of the grants<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>bread <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>cakes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">antelopes</span>, beef, veal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>kinds of wine,<br/>
honey, oil, beer, milk, essences, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>) is recorded in the lists below the<br/>
inscriptions, from which we also learn that the king <span style="color: #0000FF;">od'ered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fowls </span>to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">river-gode </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>much corn as a granary could contain to Amman of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-Walls </span>of the two chapels are also occupied with<br/>
scenes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>and worship.<br/>
<br/>
Various opinions have been expressed as to the reason of the<br/>
special reverence paid to the Nile at this particular <span style="color: #0000FF;">defile</span>. The<br/>
narrows of Silsileh were perhaps <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>or even impossible to<br/>
pass in earliest antiquity, and so probably came to be regarded as<br/>
the second entrance of the river into Egypt, the first being at the<br/>
cataract at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assudn</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This is the more probable as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kdm </span>Ombo was<br/>
certainly reckoned as belonging to Nubia.<br/>
