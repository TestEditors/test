</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">es </span>follows:'The fortress, captured by His Majesty in the 8th year;<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shalma </span>(its <span style="color: #0000FF;">name</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Lepsius suggests a <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>translation. Shalma<br/>
is perhaps Salem (or possibly <span style="color: #0000FF;">Selena </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hierosolymai</span>). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">inn<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">scription </span>referring to the second fortress from the top in the third<br/>
row to the right, reads:'Fortress captured by His Majesty in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">land </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amour</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tapur </span>its name'. The mention of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amdur </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>the names of the other fortresses seem to refer Taper to Palestine<br/>
(a fortress on Mount Tabor), in spite of the natural temptation to<br/>
connect Tapur with the ancient name of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tapurs</span>, a people<br/>
dwelling in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Margins</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>between <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bactria </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyrcania</span>, and to<br/>
recall <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>statement that the warlike representations on the<br/>
tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osymandyas </span>referred to the campaigns of the builder against<br/>
the Bactrians. Between the fortresses Egyptian youths appear<br/>
leading the captured Asiatic princes, most of whom are chained by<br/>
the neck, though some of them have their hands tied together<br/>
above their heads. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>conquerors accelerate the steps of their<br/>
unhappy victims with <span style="color: #0000FF;">stoves</span>, and in the second row <span style="color: #0000FF;">from </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot</span>,<br/>
a young <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer </span>is shown plucking the <span style="color: #0000FF;">board </span>of an aged Asiatic.<br/>
Farther to the right, and reaching to the fallen and more or less<br/>
severely injured summit of the pylon, are some very varied military<br/>
representations, some of which are unfortunately much defaced.<br/>
To the right is a realistic battle-scene<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Egyptian chariots have<br/>
overwhelmed those of the Asiatics; and below appear fresh regiments<br/>
of Egyptian infantry, marching in step. Each soldier is armed<br/>
with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">lance</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>short or curved sword, and a large shield. Before<br/>
every four soldiers is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">non-commissioned </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">officer </span>with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">staff</span>. The<br/>
command to pitch the camp has already been given, and below and<br/>
to the left of the combatants are <span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>and animals enjoying their <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-s<br/>
</span>earned rest. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Weapon </span>and booty lie in heaps; soldiers are drinking<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">leather-bottles</span>; and others are foddering the horses and <span style="color: #0000FF;">asses<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">war</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chariots </span>are drawn up in two long lines, and the veterinary<br/>
surgeon is operating with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pointed </span>instrument on the hoof of an<br/>
ass. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">camp-police </span>are using their <span style="color: #0000FF;">stoves</span>, not in jest merely,<br/>
for beside a man drinking from a wine-skin are some drunken and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">roystering </span>soldiers. Immediately above the horizontal surface,<br/>
whence the broken part of the pylon rises in steps, we see the warhorses beside the chariots, and the recumbent <span style="color: #ff0000;">fighting-alien </span>of the<br/>
Pharaoh guarding the royal tent. The chariots approach in good<br/>
order like the infantry; in the lowest row the wheels pass over<br/>
slaughtered enemies. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>extant rows of chariots excellently<br/>
illustrate the passage in Exodus xiv, 7:<span style="color: #0000FF;">'And </span>he <span style="color: #0000FF;">took </span>six hundred<br/>
chariots, and all the chariots of Egypt, and captains over every one<br/>
of them'.<br/>
<br/>
The representations on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span>. Half of the W. side (Pl. <span style="color: #ff0000;">h</span>) of the<br/>
first pylon, also representing scenes from the war with the Kheta,<br/>
are even more realistic. (Other similar scenes from the Kheta<br/>
campaign are to be seen on the pylon at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luxor </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p-412 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
