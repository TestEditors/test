</span>of the king, the symbol of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'panegyric </span>tent, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">number<br/>
<br/>
</span>of stars. A dedicatory inscription, dividing the ceiling into two<br/>
parts, records that'this Memnonium was erected in the temple of<br/>
Abydos to his forefathers and all the cycles of gods of heaven and<br/>
earth, by the king, lord of the diadems, who is born again, who<br/>
surpasses all in strength and <span style="color: #0000FF;">annihilate</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the barbarians, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">vie-torious </span>Horus, who appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>new glory, bearing <span style="color: #0000FF;">away </span>over the<br/>
barbarians in all countries, the king of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Upper </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Lower Egypt,<br/>
who achieves noble deeds, the lord of both worlds, Ra-ma-men<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>He erected to them these venerated sanctuaries outside the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis</span>, building them of stone and inlaying them with gold, in<br/>
an everlasting work outlasting human life, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ete</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>By the right<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">well </span>on entering the corridor from the second hypostyle is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">celebrated </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a*Tablot </span>of Abydos, consisting of three long rows of royal<br/>
<br/>
shields or <span style="color: #ff0000;">cartonches </span>0, before which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sad </span>and his son Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.<br/>
<br/>
</span>stand in adoration. The praying king raises his right hand and holds<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">concur </span>in his left hand; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">boy-prime</span>, standing in front of him,<br/>
still <span style="color: #0000FF;">beam </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">look </span>of youth, hanging over his temples. In his<br/>
raised hands he <span style="color: #0000FF;">bears </span>written <span style="color: #0000FF;">ons</span>. The adjoining inscription reads:<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Recitation </span>of songs of praise by Prince Ramses, son and firstborn of<br/>
the king who loves him'. Above the shields is another inscription,<br/>
which describes the king's <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>as made to Ptah-Sokar-Osiris,<br/>
the lord of the sarcophagus in the Memnonium of Abydos and <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nab<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Met</span>) the royal forefather of Seti<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He enumerates his gifts<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>1000<br/>
loaves of bread, 1000 barrels of beer, 1000 cattle, 1000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">gease</span>,<br/>
1000 <span style="color: #ff0000;">incensenofi'erings</span>, 1000 <span style="color: #ff0000;">oilwofierings</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>1000 pieces of cloth,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">%</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>garments, 1000 barrels of wins, 1000 holy <span style="color: #0000FF;">otterings </span>The<br/>
figure 1000 here, which occurs in almost all <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>lists and also<br/>
in other <span style="color: #0000FF;">formulae</span>, is not, of course, to be taken literally but simply<br/>
as equivalent to many. The king, as we see, brings his youthful<br/>
son into the hall dedicated to his ancestors, where the earlier rulers<br/>
of Egypt, under the symbol of their name, dwell beside the tomb<br/>
of Osiris. He teaches the boy to <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>rich gifts, such as hereafter<br/>
he would wish <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>to his own <span style="color: #0000FF;">manes</span>. It is beyond doubt that<br/>
Seti was still living when this inscription was set up, and yet<br/>
he already adds his own name to those of his predecessors; it<br/>
occupies the whole of the lowest row (the third from the top) of the<br/>
royal table, being repeated 19 times with <span style="color: #0000FF;">prefix </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">affix</span>. The<br/>
living Seti provides for the future Osiris <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>for his worship at the<br/>
holy grave<span style="color: #0000FF;">...</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">...</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">... </span>In the first volume of this Handbook (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">80</span>) it has<br/>
been shown that the establishment of the chronology of the Egyptian<br/>
kings was rendered possible only by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">collation </span>of the lists <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofManctho<br/>
</span>with the lists of Pharaohs preserved <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the monuments. Among<br/>
the latter none approaches in importance the royal tablet <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
