from right to left, is as follows:<span style="color: #0000FF;">'He </span>has built the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Silver </span>Chamber for<br/>
the olden one, as a building for eternity, he has adorned it with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">multitu </span>e of stones, with all the wonderful gems of the mountains, so as to<br/>

according to the precepts of the ancients referring thereto'. The room<br/>
here and elsewhere named the Gold Chamber is in the central story of<br/>
the temple, and is entered from the W. staircase. In this room, if we<br/>
have interpreted the inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">Might</span>, were made all kinds of statuettes,<br/>
necklaces and bracelets for the sacred images, amulets, and other precious<br/>
articles <span style="color: #ff0000;">used </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-services5 </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">goldsmith</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>working according to<br/>
strictly prescribed rules and under the immediate control of the high<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">prism</span>. Possibly, however, such articles were only repaired here.<br/>

The lower part of the wall of the silver chamber is decorated<br/>
with a representation of considerable geographical importance. At<br/>
