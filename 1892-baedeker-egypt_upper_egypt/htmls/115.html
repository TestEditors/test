<span>68 Route <span style="color: #0000FF;">d</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>ABYDOS. Temple of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
<br/>
</span>here is all the more striking from the obvious pains of the founder<br/>
to make a costly and enduring monument. Where Seti contented<br/>
himself with limestone, Ramses made lavish use of granite, Oriental<br/>
alabaster, and black <span style="color: #ff0000;">graywaoke</span>. The remaining <span style="color: #0000FF;">fragment</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>show<br/>
that Ramses erected <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>of granite in <span style="color: #0000FF;">front </span>of his cenotaph, and<br/>
that caryatide-like figures of Osiris, <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>long since shattered, stood<br/>
at the sides of the first peristyle court. Plastic ornamentation was<br/>
freely used and so richly painted that the colours have to this day<br/>
clung to some of the fragments. Ramses followed the example of<br/>
his father in consecrating a chamber to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">manes </span>of his ancestors.<br/>
In 1818 Mr. Bankes discovered in the chamber to the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">first </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cctostyle </span>room a royal list of eighteen names, two of which<br/>
were partly destroyed, and the relics of these tablets are still in <span style="color: #0000FF;">aim</span>.<br/>
M. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mimaut</span>, the French Consul General, tore down the walls on<br/>
which the important <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>were represented and sent the stones<br/>
to Paris, whence they passed by purchase to the British Museum.<br/>
Almost no inscription has been left intact here. We learn, however,<br/>
that Ramses was much more anxious than his father to record his<br/>
own achievements. Not a few names of peoples and towns which he<br/>
subdued or captured may still be discerned among the ruins.<br/>
<br/>
The visitor will gladly arrest his steps by the representation of<br/>
a grand procession, which is to be found inside the great court, to<br/>
the right and left of the entrance. The procession, beginning at<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. corner of the hall, which was formerly surrounded with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris-pillars</span>, extends over the whole of the N. wall. Four temple<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>are represented, one described as a secretary, two with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">leopard-shins </span>as priests of Osiris and of the house of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramada </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Menriamon </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khnumt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abdu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>connected with Abydos), and the fourth <span style="color: #ff0000;">as<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kerhub</span>. Animals, some living and some dead, are brought to them<br/>
for <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Among these are <span style="color: #ff0000;">antelopes</span>, geese, and oxen of <span style="color: #0000FF;">extraordinary </span>size and fatness. On the right side of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">foreucourt </span>are<br/>
similar scenes, in which the procession is still more grandly equipped.<br/>
Here appear the royal <span style="color: #ff0000;">wsruchariot</span>, numerous officials, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes</span>,<br/>
while incense is burned before the statue of the monarch. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">co </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">louring </span>of these figures is surprisingly well preserved.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the outside of the temple, N. side, is an inscription relating to<br/>
the Kheta war, discovered by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eisenlohr </span>in 1870; unfortunately only the<br/>
lower parts of lines are preserved. Adjacent, to the W. and <span style="color: #0000FF;">N</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">... </span>are<br/>
representations of events in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">War</span>. similar to those of the<br/>
Ramesseum at Thebes. The exterior of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>wall <span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span>covered with a<br/>
long inscription, recounting the building of the temple, of which the<br/>
following is a translation.'Behold his Majesty, Life, Salvation, and<br/>
Health, the beloved <span style="color: #0000FF;">son </span>representing his father <span style="color: #ff0000;">Unncfer </span>and makin him<br/>
a beautiful and lordly dwelling, built for eternity of white, <span style="color: #0000FF;">goo</span>, fair<br/>
stone, the two great pylons of finished workmanship, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">door-ways </span>of<br/>
syenite. The doors therein of <span style="color: #0000FF;">bronco</span>, plated with real <span style="color: #0000FF;">electrum</span>; the<br/>
great seat (to. the inner sanctuary) of alabaster; its sanctuary covered<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">gr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nite</span>, and its exalted seat of <span style="color: #0000FF;">up </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">up</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">meshes </span>(cradle) for its<br/>
cycle of gods. <span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span>exalted father lies within, even as Ra is united <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
</span>heaven; his lordly <span style="color: #ff0000;">ortrait </span>is by him that <span style="color: #0000FF;">beget </span>him, even as Horus on<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">i</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>the throne of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">other</span>. He has daily multiplied the <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">all<br/>
