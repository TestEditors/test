</span>astronomical representations <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>, others seem to apply much more closely<br/>
to the temple at Medinet <span style="color: #0000FF;">Habu</span>, built by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">I. </span>who <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>the name<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Elsewhere </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ascension </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Osyrnandyas</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>well as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramses </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ill</span>. Among these<br/>
latter points are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lion-hunt </span>on the temple-library (p. 167). Possibly<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">explanation </span>is that <span style="color: #0000FF;">iodorus </span>wrote his description from memory after<br/>
leaving Thebes and mingled features of both temples in his account.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller will he <span style="color: #0000FF;">assisted </span>to form a judgment on the question<br/>
for himself by the following main points from the description by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diodm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tile</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nu </span>the entrance is a pylon of coloured stone (probably granite is<br/>
intended<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>though erroneously), 2 plethra long (<span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">45 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ells </span>high.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Then </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fellows </span>a square <span style="color: #0000FF;">peristyle</span>, with sides measuring <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>plethra (404 ft)<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The roof is <span style="color: #0000FF;">supported</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>not by columns, but by 16 figures <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">living </span>beings,<br/>
each carved in an antique style out of a sin le stone. The entire roof<br/>
is 2 orgyia (<span style="color: #0000FF;">111/2 </span>ft.) broad, and is formed 0 solid stone, decorated with<br/>
stars on a blue ground<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Beyond the peristyle are another entrance and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pylon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">amazing </span>from the first only in having various figures carved<br/>
upon it. Beside the entrance are 3 monolithic <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Humane </span>of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Syene </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span>, according to a better reading'of stone from Syene'). <span style="color: #0000FF;">One </span>of<br/>
these, a sitting figure, exceeds in size all other statues in Egypt; at its<br/>
foot (<span style="color: #0000FF;">footstool</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>it measures more than 7 <span style="color: #0000FF;">oils</span>. The others, to the right<br/>
and left <span style="color: #0000FF;">ge'ie</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">r</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,1</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">y</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>of the knees of this statue, represent the sister and<br/>
mother, an are smaller <span style="color: #ff0000;">then </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first</span>. This work is not only noteworthy<br/>
for its size, but deserves admiration <span style="color: #0000FF;">also </span>for its artistic beauty<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is<br/>
also remarkable for the character of the stone, in which neither a crack<br/>
nor <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>flaw is to be seen in spite of its unusual <span style="color: #0000FF;">sire</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">V </span>This pylon is<br/>
succeeded by a peristyle court which seems even more worthy of remark<br/>
than the preceding. It contains various sculptures <span style="color: #0000FF;">carved </span>in the stone,<br/>
representing the were carried on by him (the. the king) against the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bootrians</span>, who had revolted against him'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Diodorus farther informs us that<br/>
the army consisted of 400,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">soldiers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20,000 </span>cavalry, in four<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">divisions </span>commanded by the king's sons<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">am </span>wall the king was<br/>
represented <span style="color: #0000FF;">storming </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fortress surrounded by a river, and hurling himself<br/>
against the enemy, along with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fierce </span>lion which accompanied him in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">battle</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>front of the last wall were two <span style="color: #0000FF;">monolithic</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nutmeg</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">27 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">all</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>in height, and beside these were three exits from the peristyle, <span style="color: #0000FF;">admitting </span>to a hy <span style="color: #0000FF;">ostyle</span>, which had the form of an <span style="color: #0000FF;">odeum </span>(music-room), and was<br/>
2 plethra (<span style="color: #0000FF;">502 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>long on each side"<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>According to Diodorus this building<br/>
also possessed a library. The last part of the temple and its upper story<br/>
are too completely <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined </span>to be satisfactorily compared with the report<br/>
of the Sicilian geographer.<br/>
<br/>
We are able to <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognize </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>pylon, the caryatides in the second<br/>
peristyle court, the largest colossus in Egypt, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">battle</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sculptures </span>with<br/>
the lion <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the fortress surrounded by water, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hypostylc </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">odcnm</span>, and<br/>
traces of the library<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Diodorus describes them in <span style="color: #0000FF;">tolerably </span>correct order,<br/>
but as <span style="color: #0000FF;">vaguely </span>as hasty travellers usually do who are unable to take<br/>
notes on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">spot<br/>
<br/>
</span>We enter the temple by the most easterly of the three extant<br/>
Pylons. This was originally 220 ft. broad, but its ruined exterior<br/>
is now more like a quarry than a building. Many representations<br/>
are still recognizable, though much defaced, on the broad surface<br/>
of its W. Side, next the first court. Beginning our inspection with<br/>
the N. Wing (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. a), to the extreme left (NE) of the beholder, we<br/>
first notice the slender representations <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofpinnaclcd </span>Asiatic fortresses,<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>rows, the two highest of which have been destroyed. Fourteen<br/>
of the original eighteen are still recognizable, each with an <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>containing its name, and in some cases also the <span style="color: #0000FF;">year </span>in<br/>
which it was taken by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>The isolated inscription at the<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">top</span>, to the left, is translated by Burton, Champollion, <span style="color: #ff0000;">andB </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">etch<br/>
