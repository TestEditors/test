queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kammat</span>, and on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">wall </span>of the second chamber, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Take</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>and his consort <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koremama</span>, may be read here. The last<br/>
chamber (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. p) dates from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.On </span>the other side of the girdle-wall, <span style="color: #0000FF;">its</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>the hill, is another<br/>
Building (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. P), erected by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, but where also are found<br/>
the names of King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hams</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebako</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Taharka</span>, and several of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>, including Philometor and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Neos </span>Dionysus. This temple was<br/>
dedicated to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pink </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Harbor</span>, whose priests are represented. In a<br/>
chamber, which may be described as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Promos</span>, are traces of the<br/>
staircase leading to the roof, now fallen in. Here also are two polygonal columns, which, taken in connection with <span style="color: #ff0000;">dedieatory </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span>, indicate that the erection of the temple was begun under the<br/>
18th Dynasty. As we again approach the N. wall of the hypostyle<br/>
of the great temple and the door by which we issued to view the<br/>
battle-reliefs of Seti L (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">127</span>), we pass, a little to the N. of the<br/>
latter, two small ruined temples (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. Q) of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">26th </span>Dynasty<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
princes of this illustrious line were less able to rear <span style="color: #0000FF;">elaborate </span>buildings at Thebes in proportion as they devoted the means at their<br/>
disposal to building <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>temples in honour of the gods of<br/>
Memphis and still more of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sale</span>, their residences in Lower Egypt.<br/>
These little temples, <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>surrounded by the ruined huts of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lo-sorted </span>Arab village, were, according to the inscriptions, built by<br/>
Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ankhnes</span>, who here appears with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psemmetikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">UL </span>(perhaps<br/>
her son?) and with her husband Aahmes. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ankhnes </span>was the daughter<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psemmetikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>To the right of the entrance and in the doorway<br/>
to the left of the smaller temple is the queen accompanied by her<br/>
young <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chamberlain </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheshonk</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ascion </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bubastites </span>of the 22nd<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>, in whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">reins </span>flowed royal blood. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">itocris</span>, wife of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Psammem<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mm </span>11., also appears in the second doorway of the interior. Her<br/>
magnificent <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>in the museum at Gizeh, while that<br/>
of Queen <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ankhnes </span>is in the British Museum.<br/>

<br/>
</span>The short projecting wall, on which is the treaty mentioned at<br/>
p. 142, is part of the series of courts and pylons which connected<br/>
the temple of Ammon with that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Math</span>, lying to the S. Before<br/>
inspecting this remarkable part of the great temple, we find our way<br/>
through the ruins to the somewhat more distant Lake. The Arabs<br/>
name this Birket <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mullahs </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>or Lake of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salt-pit</span>, as the water has<br/>
become saline and undrinkable through infiltration<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is known<br/>
that each temple formerly possessed a Sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lake</span>, and there is no<br/>
doubt that in antiquity the golden boat of the god used to <span style="color: #0000FF;">float </span>upon<br/>
the water of this pond, kept pure and fresh. The banks were <span style="color: #0000FF;">anciently </span>faced with hewn stones, and traces of these are still to be<br/>
seen on the W., <span style="color: #0000FF;">8</span>, and especially on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>or nearest side, though<br/>
at most points they were covered by rubbish in the course of ages.<br/>
Between this lake and the part of the main temple <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">enclosed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
