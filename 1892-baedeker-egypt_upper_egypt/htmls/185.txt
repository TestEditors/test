<br/>
temple, which we reach by proceeding at once to the right (E),<br/>
afterwards returning to the N. wall in following the description<br/>
below<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wall </span>the reliefs are in two divisions, an upper<br/>
and a lower. The series begins at the top, to the left of the beholder.<br/>
Here we see King Seti alighting from his chariot, in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-wooded<br/>
</span>country belonging to the tribes of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Romanian </span>(Armenians) and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Retennn </span>(Syrians). These are compelled to fell trees, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">are</span>"<br/>
leafy and seem to he tell and slender; and were probably to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>used<br/>
for ship-building (as Solomon used the trees felled by the people<br/>
of Hiram) or for <span style="color: #ff0000;">fug-stsifs </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">physiognomies </span>of the Asiatics are<br/>
distinctly characterized. The fortress appearing behind the horse<br/>
is named'Katbar to the N. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hennma</span>'. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the representation below<br/>
the king is shown driving in his chariot above the slain. Beside<br/>
the horses, which drew the king on state occasions, are their names;<br/>
the king's favourite horse is here called'Victory in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes'.</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Terms </span>en pa Kanana, the fortress Kanana, is overcome. This was<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Seti</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>first great exploit, which he performed, as the inscription<br/>
informs us, in the first year of his reign, when he <span style="color: #ff0000;">overthrew </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Sheen</span>, the Semitic neighbours of Egypt from Zar (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusium</span>) to<br/>
the fortress of Kanana (Canaan)<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wig </span>majesty was towards them<br/>
as a furious lion. They were transformed to corpses, hewn down<br/>
in their blood within their valleys'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Confused heaps of slain appear<br/>
below the fortress (to the left). An Asiatic, with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">list</span>, prays with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">praised </span>hands for mercy; several fall pierced with arrows. Only<br/>
one escapes from among ten thousand to proclaim in distant lands<br/>
the bravery of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">king.-We </span>now reach the N. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall</span>, where also<br/>
there is an upper and a lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">series </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>In the first<br/>
scene (to the extreme left), above, the army has penetrated far<br/>
enough to storm the fortress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ninfia </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nineveh</span>), in the land of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Chaldaeans</span>. The stream which washes the stronghold <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the Tigris<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The inhabitants of the country, who are represented full face somewhat awkwardly and contrary to the usual Egyptian method,<br/>
conceal themselves among trees. The king, advancing to the attack<br/>
in his chariot (his head and that of his galloping horse have been<br/>
broken <span style="color: #0000FF;">off</span>) seizes two of them standing in their chariot, and<br/>
shoots arrows against the mounted fees. In the adjoining scene<br/>
(nearly obliterated) the king is binding captives with his own hand,<br/>
and drags others behind his chariot; to the right he appears dragging <span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span>captives with him <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>drawing others in two rows behind<br/>
him. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>single line inscription between the rows <span style="color: #0000FF;">name</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>these<br/>
prisoners the mighty princes of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retennu </span>(Syrians or Assyrians).<br/>
In the representation higher up, beyond a damaged portion of the<br/>
wall, the king appears in his chariot, with his right hand raised<br/>
and holding in his left his bow and the cords to which other two<br/>
rows of prisoners (described as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retennn </span>hart, or Upper Syrians)<br/>
are fastened. The scene takes place before the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thebes </span>triad, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amm</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ink</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">when </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>king <span style="color: #0000FF;">aka </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mu</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
