<br/>
</span>with by modern buildings. The<br/>
house of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moharb </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Todrus/ </span>the German consular agent <span style="color: #0000FF;">e. </span>102), lies<br/>
farther to the N., near the <span style="color: #ff0000;">landingplace</span>, where traces of an ancient<br/>
construction may be seen, which<br/>
is unfortunately disappearing before the annual inundations, and<br/>
not far from the principal pylon. To the left of the main pylon<br/>
is the village, with a shop, kept<br/>
by a Greek, at which provisions<br/>
of all kinds and porter, ale, candles, etc. may be purchased. Farther to the N.E. dwell numerous<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ghawazi</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The removal of later buildings<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'Temple </span>of Luxor has<br/>
rendered it easy to reconstruct its<br/>
ground-plan (see <span style="color: #0000FF;">opposite</span>), and to<br/>
see that its erection was gradual<br/>
and more or less <span style="color: #0000FF;">affected </span>by the<br/>
existence of still <span style="color: #0000FF;">earlier-buildings</span>.<br/>
The general main axis of the temple<br/>
lies from S.W. to N.E.; but the<br/>
axis of the N. portion <span style="color: #0000FF;">deviate</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>considerably from the direction of that<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>portion, partly on <span style="color: #ff0000;">account<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>of the shape of the river-bank<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>partly because it was desired to have<br/>
the pylons at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Luxorjcorrespondlng<br/>
</span>to those of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kamak</span>. A careful<br/>
examination indeed reveals three<br/>
different axial directions. These<br/>
deviate from the true meridian, at<br/>
an angle of <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>' 21" on the 8., and<br/>
at an angle of <span style="color: #ff0000;">51Â° </span>on the N. As<br/>
was the custom, the part of the<br/>
temple containing the sanctuary<br/>
(the S. part) was built <span style="color: #0000FF;">first</span>, including the large peristyle <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall</span>. This<br/>
took place in the 18th Dyn. under<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amenhotep.III.</span>, while the W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">portions </span>were added by Ramses II.<br/>
From the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisk</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>to the back of<br/>
the sanctuary, the total length of<br/>
the temple is 284 yds. Later kings<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
