square, in the decoration of which the central block is treated as if it<br/>
were an enormous sarcophagus. In fact the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sarcophagus </span>of the deceased<br/>
lies below the centre of this block, and is reached by means of a perpendicular shaft, 18 ft. in depth, at the end of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Corridor to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">right </span>of<br/>
the main passage. By descending the shaft, a room <span style="color: #0000FF;">191/2 </span>ft. deep is reached,<br/>
and from the roof of this there is an entrance to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus-hall</span>,<br/>
which is exactly beneath the <span style="color: #0000FF;">square </span>block above described. The length<br/>
of this private tomb without the <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-chambers </span>is 862 <span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span>, and its <span style="color: #0000FF;">superficial </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">area </span>2470 sq. yds. or with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Metsftrrllaushers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2600 </span>sq. yds.<br/>
<br/>
To the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>this huge tomb are several smaller ones of the<br/>
same period, with finely worked antechambers, and false doors, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>carefully executed inscriptions. Some of these, especially those <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>

</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">butions </span>to the knowledge of the family of Pharaohs which formed<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">28th </span>Dynasty. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>queen Nitocris of the 6th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>, known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">e<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">pyramid-builder</span>, is said to have been beautiful and <span style="color: #0000FF;">light-haired</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>With her may have been confounded the princess of the 26th Dyn.<br/>
with the same name, who was buried at <span style="color: #ff0000;">elvAsasif</span>, and lived shortly<br/>
before the famous <span style="color: #0000FF;">courtesan </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Naucratis</span>, named Rhodopis or the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rosy-checked</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Nitocris the <span style="color: #ff0000;">older </span>and Rhodopis were probably called<br/>
by the same name, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the fair one, in the mouths of the Egyptians,<br/>
and Herodotus hearing that the'Fair one' had lived shortly before<br/>
Amasis, confused the two, and reported that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">courtesan </span>Rhodopis<br/>
was considered the builder of pyramids<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">See </span>Vol. 1., p. 346.<br/>

This temple derives its name, meaning the North Church or<br/>
North Monastery, from an ecclesiastical brick building of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Christion </span>period, the remains of which are mentioned on p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">227</span>. Der<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">el-bahri </span>is reached from <span style="color: #0000FF;">tsl-Asus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">iOminutes</span>. Its situation is<br/>
remarkably fine, its terraces which we ascend, being framed by a<br/>
semicircle of high and rugged rocks, of a light brown and golden<br/>
colour. If Thebes had been in Greece, this is where its citizens<br/>
would have placed their theatre. The Egyptians whose thoughts<br/>
were <span style="color: #0000FF;">Inner </span>of death than of life, founded a sanctuary for the<br/>
worship of the dead. Apparently an avenue of sphinxes, of which<br/>
some traces remain, connected this with the landing-stage, where<br/>
boats coming from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak </span>on the W. bank were anchored. This<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>work was carried out during the rise of the New <span style="color: #0000FF;">Empire</span>, and the numerous processions of pilgrims began in the<br/>
16th cent. <span style="color: #ff0000;">3.0</span>. The laying out of the terraces was begun by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>L, and completed by his daughter, Queen Hatshepsu, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ha-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tatra-Ramaka</span>, familiar to us as the raiser of the great obelisk of<br/>
Karnak <span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>133). Here too her brothers, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>111.,<br/>
although their names are mentioned, fall into the background<br/>
when compared with their energetic and ambitious <span style="color: #0000FF;">F </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ter</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">After<br/>
