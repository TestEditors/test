<br/>
Isis, the life giving goddess of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Act</span>, he. of Abaton or the holy island. The last name deserves mention here, for the spot known to<br/>
the ancients as Abaton, which must have been peculiarly holy in<br/>
their eyes, is named innumerable times in the inscriptions of the<br/>
temple of Isis. It must therefore be looked for <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Philae </span>itself. The<br/>
inscription on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Architrave </span>of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">enter </span>or West Side states that<br/>
the king erected this building for his mother Isis, and that he rebuilt the hall for her of good white hewn stone, surrounded with<br/>
columns, with inscriptions throughout its whole extent, and, as the<br/>
line below the architrave adds, painted in colours. The inner side<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave </span>bears an invocation to <span style="color: #0000FF;">leis</span>, mother of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gods<br/>
<br/>
</span>This little temple had doors on the E. and W. sides, not,<br/>
however, opposite to each other, and another on the N. side, next<br/>
the main temple. The last <span style="color: #0000FF;">lamb </span>into a spacious <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fore- </span>Court<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. B), enclosed on the right and left by covered <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnades</span>. The<br/>
W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">colonnade </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>F) follows the bank of the river, while that to<br/>
the E. or right (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span>D) runs <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the direction of the centre of the<br/>
first great pylon, but not at right angles to it, <span style="color: #0000FF;">affording </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>example<br/>
of the variety of axial direction exhibited throughout the temple.<br/>
<br/>
When we remember that a portion of the first pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">hypwthral </span>Space, which we have just quitted, were built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectar<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nebus</span>, and that all the other parts of the temple are of later data,<br/>
we have an adequate explanation of the great irregularity displayed<br/>
in its plan. It is quite certain that the structures that now <span style="color: #ff0000;">hear<br/>
</span>the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Neotanebus </span>(a portal and a vestibule) were not the<br/>
only buildings on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>under that king, for the construction of<br/>
every temple, without exception, began with the sanctuary and<br/>
ended with the doors. We may assume that an extensive temple<br/>
stood here before its removal by the Persians; and that the latter<br/>
largely destroyed the works of their rival. The parts that were<br/>
spared were then incorporated by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolomaic </span>builders, while the<br/>
Romans united the work of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lagidae </span>with the ancient vestibule<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectauebus </span>by means of the tapering peristyle court.<br/>
<br/>
b<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Colonnaded Court<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This space is bounded on the W.<br/>
side by a long wall, pierced here and there with windows, which,<br/>
based on a firm substructure on the river-bank, forms the back of<br/>
a narrow, but unusually long Colonnade (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. F<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>100 <span style="color: #0000FF;">wing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The<br/>
latter, built under the Romans, <span style="color: #0000FF;">hue </span>a row of 31 (<span style="color: #0000FF;">formerly </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">2</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span>, each 16 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>high, on its E. side, and has a roof of good <span style="color: #ff0000;">casssetted </span>work<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The colour of the hieroglyphics and representations<br/>
is still remarkably vivid in various places, especially in the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">portion </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the vestibule of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus</span>. There appear <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">em </span>with his<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches</span>, Claudius <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesar </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Germanium </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Autocr-wr </span>before<br/>
Horus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tasentnefert </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pinebtati </span>(who also appears at Ombos,<br/>
p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">261</span>) worshipping the lord of Ombos. Farther to the N., on the<br/>
back wall of the colonnade are the name of Tiberius and a fine<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Greek </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beginning</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">imsrs</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
