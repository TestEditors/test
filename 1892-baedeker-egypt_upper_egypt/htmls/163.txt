<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">spicuous </span>as a city of temples and priests, but its inhabitants <span style="color: #0000FF;">tie</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>clined in wealth. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>may be easily conjectured that these, formerly<br/>
the chief among the citizens of Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">here </span>but ill the <span style="color: #0000FF;">face </span>which<br/>
now placed them far behind the Alexandrians. Strangers sat on the<br/>
throne of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Its</span>, and cared not to take the trouble to visit in person<br/>
the remote Diospolis, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coronation-town </span>of the Pharaohs, who<br/>
had been <span style="color: #0000FF;">accustomed </span>to make <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>triumphal entry after each victory<br/>
and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>thanks to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">noble </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lagidae </span>were succeeded by worthless rulers, whose extravagant tastes forced them<br/>
to drain the resources of the Thebe'id and other provinces. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Under </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gluttonous </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">II</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and his consort Cleopatra <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">loose<br/>
</span>the Alexandrians rose in revolt and <span style="color: #0000FF;">expelled </span>Alexander <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, the<br/>
king's son. The citizens of the capital of Upper Egypt dared <span style="color: #0000FF;">else<br/>
</span>to rise in the attempt to win back their lost independence; and<br/>
they refused to <span style="color: #0000FF;">lay </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dome </span>their arms even when Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Soter </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ll</span>.<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Lathyrus</span>) was recalled from banishment by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alexandrians </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and<br/>
</span>was universally recognized in Lower Egypt. The army of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lathyrus<br/>
</span>besieged the town, whose inhabitants bravely defended themselves<br/>
in the huge temples, each of which served as a fortress<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Finally,<br/>
however, Thebes was stormed; its treasures were plundered and<br/>
its venerable monuments terribly mutilated. Thenceforward Thebes<br/>
is only mentioned as a goal of inquisitive travellers, who under the<br/>
Roman emperors were attracted to the Nile by two monuments in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">particular </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>the pyramids and the musical colossus of Memnon on<br/>
the W. bank at Thebes. Diodorus (60 <span style="color: #0000FF;">BAY</span>) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Strobe </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">24130</span>.)<br/>
describe Thebes as it was after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">destruction </span>The latter found<br/>
only a few relies on each side of the Nile, just as the traveller of<br/>
to-day does. An earthquake, no common occurrence in Egypt,<br/>
had done more than the hand of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fierce </span>warrior to destroy the<br/>
monuments of thousands of years. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>27 <span style="color: #ff0000;">or'24 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">3.0. </span>a convulsion<br/>
of this nature wrought such havoc <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>Eusebius declared, though<br/>
not without exaggeration, that the Egyptian Thebes <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>been<br/>
levelled with the ground. In the absence of some such natural<br/>
force, we should be tempted to declare that the annihilation of<br/>
many parts of the monuments of Thebes must have been a <span style="color: #0000FF;">task<br/>
</span>only less <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>than their construction. At many points, especially in the temple at Karnak, the injury is plainly to be ascribed<br/>
to human hands. The representations, dating from the period of<br/>
the Ptolemies, within the second main pylon, to the left as we <span style="color: #0000FF;">approach </span>the large hypostyle hall, have been removed with <span style="color: #0000FF;">axes </span>or<br/>
hammers. Some smaller injuries, especially to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>of the<br/>
kings, were due to political reasons, as when <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>111., after he<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">obtained </span>the sole power, destroyed the cartouches of his too ambitious sister and guardian; others are to be ascribed to the evil habit<br/>
of certain Pharaohs of appropriating the monuments of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">predecessors </span>by substituting their own names for those of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">real<br/>
</span>builders; <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>yet others had religious causes, as when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">name </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
