<br/>
who lives with his children and grandchildren on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bigch</span>, willingly<br/>
assists travellers. The view of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-bank </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">1mm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">expectedly </span>beautiful, especially to those who have just <span style="color: #0000FF;">quitted </span>the<br/>
rugged rocks of the cataract or the arid desert; while, on the other<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hand</span>, the views from the island, especially from its rocky S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span>,<br/>
are imposing and sometimes peculiarly wild.<br/>
<br/>
The buildings on the island which demand a visit are: i. The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Templ</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of Isis; 2. The Chapel of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather</span>; 3. The Ruins and the<br/>
Portal of Diocletian, in the N.W.; and <span style="color: #ff0000;">d. </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">*eioNut</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Bigets<br/>
</span>and the Cataract Islands also repay a visit.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple of Isis.<br/>
<br/>
This beautiful structure dates from various periods, and its<br/>
different parts show an almost capricious irregularity in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">positions </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>reference to each other. The traveller is <span style="color: #0000FF;">recommended<br/>
</span>to visit the various portions in the following order, but he is warned<br/>
against lingering too long over any of them, if his time be limited<br/>
or if his inspection have no Special <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>aim. It is better to<br/>
obtain a good general impression from the whole, than to examine<br/>
the details minutely. In order to understand the arrangement of<br/>
the temple, it must not be forgotten that it was <span style="color: #ff0000;">predminently </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">a<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">pilgrim-resort</span>. The processions of pilgrims, whether they <span style="color: #0000FF;">approached </span>from Egypt or from Nubia, were compelled to steer for<br/>
the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>of the island, for the rocks to the N. of it prevented<br/>
anything like a ceremonial approach. The portals of the temple<br/>
therefore faced the 8., and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">festal </span>boats disembarked their <span style="color: #0000FF;">passengers </span>on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>coast. We likewise begin our visit from the S.,<br/>
or more exactly from the extreme S.W., to which we proceed<br/>
direct from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Our attention is first attracted by<br/>
the strong erection of <span style="color: #0000FF;">been </span>stones facing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stream </span>The steps of<br/>
a Stone Staircase within the quay-wall are still to be seen on the<br/>
S.W. coast; and there was another staircase on the S. coast, to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">E. </span>of the building of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The Building of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebns </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. A). Two <span style="color: #0000FF;">Obelisk</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the entrance to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hyptethral </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ForcaCourt</span>, which the pilgrim entered<br/>
first, and where he was received, and perhaps also examined and<br/>
taxed. With the exception of the central portion of the first pylon<br/>
(p. 287), dating from this <span style="color: #ff0000;">some </span>king, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, this is the<br/>
oldest part of the whole temple. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">obelisks</span>, made of sandstone,<br/>
instead of the usual granite, were small and stood upon stone chests.<br/>
The W. obelisk is still standing, but the E. obelisk is represented<br/>
by its chest merely.<br/>
<br/>
The E. obelisk itself was found prostrate by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Banker </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">1815</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>at<br/>
his request removed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Belzoni</span>, despite the protests of<br/>
Drovetti who regarded <span style="color: #ff0000;">at </span>as his private property. From Alexandria it<br/>
was taken to England, where it now <span style="color: #0000FF;">thud</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>at Kingston <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall </span>in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dorsetshire</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">9n </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lotus</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>part of the pedestal is a long Greek inscription<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">containing </span>a petition addressed by the priests of Isis <span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">g </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Eu </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">gates </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
