his enemies. To the left, he again receives the <span style="color: #ff0000;">scoptre </span>and leads<br/>

<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">111111111011. </span>of the pavilion can only be gained from one of<br/>
the walls of the court to our left as we enter. The attempt is not<br/>
without <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty</span>; and some <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the rooms are not <span style="color: #0000FF;">accessible </span>at all.<br/>
In several of the apartments are <span style="color: #ff0000;">wellmpreserved </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wall</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sculptures </span>of no<br/>
little interest; <span style="color: #0000FF;">up</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>in the apartment above the passage and in the<br/>
right wing. Ramses III. is here represented in his harem. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nude<br/>
</span>maidens with whom he is playing <span style="color: #0000FF;">chose </span>(the scene in the ruined <span style="color: #ff0000;">N.<br/>
</span>entrance-room to the right is well <span style="color: #ff0000;">soon </span>from before the facade of the<br/>
building), or who hand to him one a fig, another a pomegranate,<br/>
another a melon, another a flower which he smells, appear from the<br/>
shape of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">feces </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>from the arrangement of their hair to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>captive princesses <span style="color: #0000FF;">rather </span>than his own children. This supposition<br/>
is farther strengthened by the occurrence here of several <span style="color: #ff0000;">reproachtations </span>of a distinctly immodest character.<br/>
<br/>
The vicious propensities of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>are <span style="color: #ff0000;">bbeted </span>with biting scorn<br/>
on other monuments<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He himself appears to <span style="color: #0000FF;">hue </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">looked </span>with peculiar<br/>
pride upon his harem, which was rich in beauty of all kinds, and to have<br/>
immortalized its memory in his Memnonium. At all events his reign<br/>
<br/>
marks the beginning of <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>epoch of luxury <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>immorality, upon which<br/>
decay <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">close</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>After passing through the gateway a, we traverse an open Space<br/>
between the pavilion and the first pylon. Before we reach the pylon,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">210m </span>wide, which conceals the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">peristyle </span>court, we pass a number of ruined walls of baked and <span style="color: #0000FF;">unbaked </span>bricks, which belonged<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic </span>village built within the temple. In <span style="color: #0000FF;">from</span>, to the left,<br/>
is a small Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ameniritis </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">26th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dyno</span>, to the rights block<br/>
with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cartonohe </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Buhlnd </span>is the temple founded<br/>
under the 18th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dyn</span>, which we visit later (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">184</span>). Standing on<br/>
the rubbish <span style="color: #0000FF;">heap </span>in front of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>pylon and looking through the<br/>
gateway into the temple, our view penetrates to the last court. There<br/>
is no more remarkable perspective in Egypt.<br/>

<br/>
</span>The large First Pylon (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">C</span>) is covered with representations<br/>
and inscriptions. First to the right we see the Pharaoh <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the conqueror of his enemies, and opposite is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Animus-Ra</span>, the king of the<br/>
gods, holding in his right <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">curved </span>sword, in his left the<br/>
sceptre, and several <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall-rings </span>surmounted by <span style="color: #0000FF;">boats </span>of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">prince</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>we read the name of Punt or Arabia, which, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, must be here interpreted in a narrow sense, as equivalent to<br/>
the coastlands <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the Red Sea. Between the king and the group of<br/>
his enemies is the inscription:'He strikes to the earth the princes<br/>
of all lands', beneath which is a horizontal row of <span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>of some<br/>
tribes (partly damaged). Beneath that again is the chief Inscription,<br/>
from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">lick </span>year of the king, relating his great deeds.<br/>
