</span>who stood in it; I led them as living captives to His Majesty, and once<br/>
more was awarded the golden necklace. I have become great, I have<br/>
reached old <span style="color: #ff0000;">age</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>I shall rest in the vault, which I have prepared<br/>
for myself<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>The tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ream</span>, still farther to the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>W.), contains<br/>
numerous representations of interest. The deceased, a son of a lady<br/>
named Aahmes and father of another Aahmes, was a prince (erpa<br/>
ha) and a large landed proprietor<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Two obelisks seem to have stood<br/>
at the entrance to this vault<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the statue of the deceased is to<br/>
be seen in its recess.<br/>
<br/>
The roof of the chapel is vaulted, and covered like the walls with a<br/>
thin coat of stucco, on which the representations and inscriptions were<br/>
painted. 0n the right <span style="color: #ff0000;">well </span>are the funeral of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ronni </span>and other scenes<br/>
connected with his death, while on the left wall are scenes from the life<br/>
of the deceased, who accompanied by his dog, surveys his possessions.<br/>
Here appear his carriage, his serfs <span style="color: #0000FF;">busted </span>in tilling the ground, and his<br/>
family in friendly union. Beside each of <span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">persona </span>waited on by the<br/>
servants of the deceased appears his name and his <span style="color: #ff0000;">relationshi </span>to the<br/>
head of the family. Among the livestock belonging to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Renni </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span>swine<br/>
are mentioned, a circumstance which appears somewhat surprising at<br/>
first, for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flesh </span>of swine was an article of diet as strictly forbidden<br/>
to the Egyptians as to the Jews. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ronni</span>, however, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>prophet of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Reboot</span>, and had to provide swine to be sacrificed to this goddess, which<br/>
accounts for his possession of the otherwise abhorred animals. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>circumstance did not escape the notice of Herodotus, who<br/>
writes:'They <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>swine to no <span style="color: #0000FF;">god</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">excel</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>Selene (goddess of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>moon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Reboot</span>) and Dionysus; making this <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacrifice </span>to the moon <span style="color: #ff0000;">always </span>at full moon, at which time they also eat swine's <span style="color: #ff0000;">flegh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">TheEgyptiana </span>assign a particular reason for <span style="color: #0000FF;">abhorring </span>swine at other <span style="color: #0000FF;">mum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>them at this one, but although I know it I am not permitted<br/>
to reveal it'. Herodotus was bound by an oath not to reveal the mystery,<br/>
from which, however, we may be able to lift the veil <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a study of the<br/>
monuments. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>related that Typhon (Seth), while hunting by moonlight,<br/>
fell in with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffin </span>of Osiris, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">barred </span>the corpse into <span style="color: #ff0000;">it</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>parts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span>.<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">id </span>nights of the waxing and waning moon. This orb is called the<br/>
left eye of Horns, and, as the inscriptions explain, it was in jeopardy<br/>
on the 15th night, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lev </span>the time of the full moon. It had been observed<br/>
that eclipses of the moon <span style="color: #0000FF;">affected </span>the light only of the full moon, and<br/>
thus arose the myth that Seth Typhon, in the form of a swine, attacks<br/>
the orb of night at the full moon and endeavours to swallow it. The<br/>
desire of <span style="color: #0000FF;">injuring </span>the enemy of the moon and of assisting the latter in<br/>
her contest against the animal that seeks to devour her, <span style="color: #ff0000;">finds </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">symbolise</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">!<br/>
</span>expression in the slaughter of swine at the time of the new moon<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Many<br/>
other Egyptian customs are also to be explained by reference to the<br/>
contest betwixt Horns and Seth<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The last three tombs farther to the left <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">WJ </span>appear to date from<br/>
the 13th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>, and are therefore much more ancient than those<br/>
just described, unless we regard the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ids-17th </span>Dyn. as ruling in<br/>
Upper Egypt contemporaneously with the Hyksos in Lower Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The first was erected to a lady named <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebeknefru</span>, by her father<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bebe</span>, who possibly himself is buried here too. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sebeknefru </span>was<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eaten </span>am, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as</span>. belonging to the king's court.<br/>
