<span>168 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span>THEBES. West <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bank</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>portion of the Ramesseum <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>in a very ruinous condition, but their<br/>
arrangement may be partly made out.<br/>
<br/>
Behind the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum </span>especially towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nw</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>are the remains<br/>
of a number of extensive <span style="color: #0000FF;">drink </span>Buildings, some of which were erected in<br/>
the time of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, as we learn from the stamps on the bricks. Among<br/>
the rest are some <span style="color: #0000FF;">walla-constructed </span>vaults. As the tomb of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H.<br/>
</span>has been discovered at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bibdn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">clwhiuldk </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">207</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span>, there can <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>no question<br/>
of his grave being here. On the other hand we learn from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">papyrusrolls </span>that a celebrated university and a seminary for scholars, comparable<br/>
to the Museum at Alexandria, were connected with the Ramesseum, and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">stood </span>at the zenith of their prosperity under Ramses and his son <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mercer<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ptah</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">light</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured </span>soil, strewn with fragments of bricks and tiles,<br/>
between the Ramesseum and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sh√©kh'Abd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">eluliurnah</span>, covers a multitude of<br/>
<br/>
raves whose existence is <span style="color: #0000FF;">undreamed </span>of by those who walk over them<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">no </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0 </span>these, belonging to a certain <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ham</span>, contains some interesting representations, the style of which indicates (for no king is named) that <span style="color: #0000FF;">it<br/>
</span>dates probably from the early empire, and is certainly not later than the<br/>
beginning of the 18th Dynasty. We may therefore conclude that Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL<br/>
</span>built his votive <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium </span>on an ancient portion of the Theban <span style="color: #0000FF;">near-spells</span>.<br/>
<br/>
About 500 paces to the N. of the Memnonium we observe the<br/>
remains of an extensive well built of Nile bricks. The name of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">HI</span>. found here on many tiles renders it probable that <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>temple built by this king or dedicated to him stood on this site.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The Tombs <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">finest-Mural</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Travellers who are not pressed for time should visit one of the<br/>
tombs of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kurost-Murra'i </span>(viz. that of Hui), on the way to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Medicatiiabu</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>reaching the fields of W. Thebes, if we look towards the<br/>
Libyan mountains, our eye falls upon numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb-entrances</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>The vaults of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diospolites </span>of the zenith of the ancient empire<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">are </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hcwn </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">limestone </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hills </span>that bound the plain of Thebes to the<br/>
W. They have recently been <span style="color: #0000FF;">classified </span>in groups, bearing the names<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellihmvillages </span>in whose domain they lie. The tombs on the<br/>
slopes behind the Ramesseum are called those of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shdhh'Abd </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">elliurnah</span>. Following thence the undulating desert region at the foot of<br/>
the Libyan hills in a S.W. direction towards Medinet Habu, we<br/>
soon pass, on the right, the gorge of Der <span style="color: #0000FF;">ohm-Medical </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">than<br/>
</span>direct our way towards the mountain-slope, projecting between the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum </span>and Medinet Habu. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">slope</span>, on which stand so me<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fetish </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hate </span>is known to the guides as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Xumet </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Hmei</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Several of<br/>
the tombs here date from the 18th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dym</span>, but the majority are of no<br/>
interest to the ordinary traveller. Only one, to which the guides<br/>
conduct travellers at once, is of exceptional interest (though recently<br/>
much injured)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>on account partly of the subject and partly of the<br/>
vivid colours of the representations it contains. Near the village<br/>
(the dogs of which are <span style="color: #0000FF;">cross-grained </span>though cowardly) is a tomb<br/>
partly converted into a stable by the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fellihin</span>. In the adjoining<br/>
tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">HoramKhsmti </span>are some <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>, of interest only to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>traveller .--Then <span style="color: #0000FF;">follow</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>tomb in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis</span>, belonging to a certain Hui, who held the high rank <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">aprince<br/>
