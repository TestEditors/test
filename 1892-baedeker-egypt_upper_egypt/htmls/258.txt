<br/>
No. 26 (see above) to the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramenkheporseueb </span>(No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>),<br/>
which, having been <span style="color: #ff0000;">Opened </span>only for a few years, is remarkably well<br/>
preserved and is well worth a visit. For stout people, however, the<br/>
entrance is almost too narrow. The deceased was chief architect to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ill</span>. The right hand inner wall of the large hall tells us of the<br/>
important works which were entrusted to him, such as the carving<br/>
of a statue of the king from a single stone, the erection of a hall of<br/>
pillars, and of numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks</span>. Here again we see tribute being<br/>
brought by princes, of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Keftu </span>(the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phoenicians</span>), of Kheta, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Trump</span>,<br/>
Kat, Katesh, etc. The arms and helmets of the foreigners, their<br/>
carriages and handsome vases are <span style="color: #0000FF;">remarkable </span>Near this, a little<br/>
to the right, is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>well-preserved tomb (No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>) of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen<br/>
</span>the scribe of the harvest, in which should be noticed the<br/>
harper and the long list of relations of the deceased, whose father<br/>
and mother were <span style="color: #0000FF;">named </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Enter</span>. In a passage there are<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">represented </span>barges with mummies of himself and his wife <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baht</span>.<br/>
In the last chamber there is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">State </span>of the 28th year of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ill</span>.<br/>
The shaft in the tomb contains a large room covered with writings<br/>
Still farther to the right is the tomb (No. 60) of a prince (<span style="color: #0000FF;">erpa-hii</span>)<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Enteiaker</span>, and on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">slope </span>that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amhhont</span>, the son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Auto</span>,<br/>
which was completely excavated in 1883. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>descent should now<br/>
be made to the gallery, in front of which is seen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wilkinson </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>House,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>to the tomb (No. 88) of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Imaiseb</span>, who was scribe of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">altars<br/>
</span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>under Ramses IX<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Neferkara</span>). The <span style="color: #0000FF;">foetal </span>barges with<br/>
the name of the king should be noticed, as well as the many golden<br/>
utensils, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">money-bags</span>, and also a series of kings, among<br/>
whom appears King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rashenen</span>, who fought against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos</span>, and<br/>
whose remarkable mummy is in the museum at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Giseh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We now descend to the plain, where there are a few more tombs<br/>
to be seen in the direction of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ssl-Asif</span>, including that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Refers<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hotep</span>, who lived under King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home</span>, the last of the 18th Dynasty.<br/>
In this should be especially noticed the funeral processions by boat<br/>
which have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">copied </span>by Wilkinson <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>Manners and Customs). The<br/>
funeral services are also recorded.<br/>
<br/>
We have to crawl through the entrance which is choked up. The<br/>
ceiling is decorated, and has a regularly recurring series of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">signifying'First</span>' and'Pro het<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>; the deceased in fact held the <span style="color: #0000FF;">office </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oi<br/>

the 39 rows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>above record the names of the relations of<br/>
the deceased, who on the left are paying homage to King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home </span>with<br/>
whom they were closely <span style="color: #0000FF;">connected </span>In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>room we see Neferhotep, sitting by the side of his sister who is adorned with flowers. Behind them is <span style="color: #0000FF;">an'freer-PMOS </span>which indicates that distinguished Egyptian<br/>
families kept private hands of music; and it may be that the special<br/>
duty of the harper <span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">song </span>has been handed down to posterity by<br/>
this inscription, was to gladden the hearts of the family when they were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">assembled </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>their <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancestor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>tomb for the solemnities in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">honour<br/>
</span>The song is not in any way of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mournful </span>character, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>is clear that<br/>
in the time of the Pharaohs, it was a pleasure to be reminded in the<br/>
tombs of the shortness of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tee </span>and the duty to enjoy it, so <span style="color: #0000FF;">ton </span>as it<br/>
lasted<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The song is headed: The words of the harper, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tarr </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
