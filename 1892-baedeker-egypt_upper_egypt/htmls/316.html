temple, flanked on either side by a tower <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>sloping walls, about<br/>

<br/>
This passage was formerly closed with a massive door with two<br/>
wings. The entire lofty <span style="color: #0000FF;">gatehouse </span>is covered from top to bottom<br/>
and on all sides with reliefs and inscriptions, amongst which,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">especially </span>on the right and left, the colossal <span style="color: #0000FF;">Figure </span>of the King (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Neos<br/>
</span>Dionysus) is conspicuous, smiting his foes, whom he holds <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the<br/>
hair, in presence of Horns and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esther</span>. In two rows, above, the<br/>
king appears praying and offering sacrifices before the gods of Edfu.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>Below, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">left </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">WI</span>) pylon, the king and queen conduct a<br/>
procession of representatives of the districts that <span style="color: #0000FF;">yield </span>gold, silver,<br/>
other metals, precious stones, cosmetics, <span style="color: #0000FF;">em</span>, and furnish them to<br/>
the temple. On the front of the pylon towers are four wide incisions,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span>on each side of the central portal<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>These were intended to<br/>
support the huge <span style="color: #0000FF;">copper</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mounted </span>wooden poles with gilded tips,<br/>
which are illustrated in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vol.1</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.168</span>. One of the lower marginal<br/>
inscriptions states that these poles were intended at Edfu to avert<br/>
the storms of heaven, and that they were adorned with gay flags at<br/>
the top.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">pitch-dark </span>lower Pylon Chambers on each side are entered<br/>
from the court by doors to the right and left of the portal, and from<br/>
each of them an easy Staircase of 242 steps in 14 flights ascends to<br/>
the Platforms of the towers. One of the towers should certainly be<br/>
ascended, in spite of the numerous steps. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">view </span>from the top<br/>
is unusually attractive, commanding not only the most imposing<br/>
survey of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">templo'buildings</span>, but also ranging <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">surrounding </span>country. The plain through which the Nile flows, with its<br/>
verdant crops and its villages fringed with palms and mimosas,<br/>
framed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert-mountains </span>in the distance, presents a scene<br/>
of surprising beauty, especially when seen under the evening light<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">renders </span>the Egyptian landscape so wonderfully distinct.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Force-Court </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ph </span>F), which is bounded in front by the<br/>
pylons, at the back by the hypostyle hall (<span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>E), and on the right<br/>
and left by the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">girdle-wall</span>, is a spacious court, <span style="color: #0000FF;">paved </span>with<br/>
broad flags, and surrounded on its E., W., and S. sides with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">COT-'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ered </span>colonnade of 32 columns. The inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">eat </span>it <span style="color: #0000FF;">y </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iously<br/>
