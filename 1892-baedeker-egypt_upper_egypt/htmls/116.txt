wine, and fruit, <span style="color: #0000FF;">filling </span>it with labourers<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>enriching it with <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>presenting cattle, <span style="color: #0000FF;">filling </span>the storehouse with <span style="color: #0000FF;">superabundance</span>, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">arse<br/>
</span>reaching to heaven, the servants of the domains of the offering being the<br/>
captives of his brave sword. His <span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure-house </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">filled </span>with all <span style="color: #0000FF;">game</span>,<br/>
with silver and gold in <span style="color: #0000FF;">bus</span>, the storehouse full of all things sent as<br/>
tribute from all <span style="color: #0000FF;">countries </span>He has constructed numerous canals, and has<br/>
planted timber of all sorts, fragrant plants from the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Foot</span>; he<br/>
has done all this, the son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Re</span>, the lord of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">diadems</span>, the beloved<br/>

<br/>
Like the temple of Seti, that of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">son </span>Ramses was also a<br/>
sanctuary <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicated </span>to Osiris, though in each case the predominant<br/>
feature is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">glorification </span>of the monarch in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">apotheosis </span>as<br/>
Osiris. Mariette was therefore on a wrong tack when he saw a<br/>
special temple of Osiris in the enclosure (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lil</span>; p. 52) to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.</span>,<br/>
near the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Etuthrbch</span>, and spent much time and money in<br/>
an attempt to find the actual grave of Osiris<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Obviously this was<br/>
merely an older sanctuary, erected by the kings of the 12th and<br/>
13th Dynasties on the site of a still more ancient temple. [ Two<br/>
steles in the Louvre, numbered <span style="color: #ff0000;">0 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">M </span>and C 12, and the great <span style="color: #0000FF;">stole<br/>
</span>of Mentuhotep, <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>in the museum of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh</span>, give us information<br/>
concerning these buildings<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>Nowadays this temple is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">more </span>heap<br/>
of rubbish, and the few interesting'finds' made here, such as the<br/>
statues of Usertesen <span style="color: #ff0000;">I. </span>and Usertesen <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, and some inscriptions of<br/>
the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>111., have been sent to the museum of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh</span>.<br/>
The same institution received the many hundred steles found partly<br/>
on the site of this temple and partly in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis </span>of Abydos.<br/>
Three such cemeteries are distinguished. The first, containing<br/>
tombs of the New Empire, from the 19th Dynasty downwards,<br/>
lies to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>of the temples of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Semi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>Another<br/>
(<span style="color: #ff0000;">NdcroPole </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">do </span>Centre) lies to the W. of the path leading from the<br/>
temple of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">so- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â« </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span>temple of Osiris, and contains<br/>
graves mainly of the 6th and <span style="color: #0000FF;">11th </span>Dynasties. Here was found the<br/>
historically valuable tablet of Una (see <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baedeker</span>'s Lower Egypt,<br/>
p. 307), who accompanied three successive rulers of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">8th </span>Dynasty<br/>
in their campaigns. The third or <span style="color: #ff0000;">neeropolis</span>, to the W. of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">so-eil </span>temple of Osiris, contains numerous graves of the 12th<br/>
and 13th Dynasties, but also many of the new empire. Among the<br/>
interesting <span style="color: #0000FF;">steles </span>found here were those of a Neferhotep of the<br/>
13th Dynasty and of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sheshonk</span>, the latter erroneously pronounced<br/>
by H. Brugsch to have been a Persian satrap. The pyramidal <span style="color: #0000FF;">structures </span>found in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">central </span>cemeteries are also interesting.<br/>
Still farther to the W. lies a quadrangular enclosure surrounded by<br/>
a lofty wall and <span style="color: #0000FF;">named </span>Shunet <span style="color: #0000FF;">es-Zebib </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">1V</span>; p. 52; magazine of<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zibehes</span>), which probably served as a place of defence against<br/>
the incursions of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Beddins </span>of the Great <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oases</span>. A Coptic <span style="color: #ff0000;">Consent<br/>
