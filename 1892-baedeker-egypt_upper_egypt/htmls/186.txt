In the corresponding scenes in the lower row the king appears in<br/>
his chariot (at the left end of the N. wall), with his back turned to<br/>

beside the lower ones is a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">fresh-water </span>lake. In the second<br/>
scene the king is shown in his chariot, shooting arrows against his<br/>
foes, who are <span style="color: #ff0000;">named'Shasu</span>' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bedtime</span>). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Fortified </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">waterwstations<br/>

The following representation is one of the most remarkable in<br/>
Egypt, for it clearly proves that a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sues </span>Canal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span>. a canal<br/>
dividing Africa from Egypt, existed as early as the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sad</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>I.<br/>
The relief represents the king on his homeward journey. His<br/>
spirited horses prance along before the light chariot, which carries<br/>
only the Pharoah and the heads of his slain enemies. (The king's<br/>
favourite horse is <span style="color: #0000FF;">named </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon </span>gives the sword'.) In his left hand<br/>
the king holds the reins and his bow, and in his right the sword of<br/>
victory, the scourge, and a number of cords to which pinioned<br/>
enemies are fastened. Three of the latter he drags after him, and<br/>
three rows of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Asiatics </span>fastened together by the neck precede the<br/>
horses. The bastions with reservoirs which the procession has to<br/>
pass are represented at the foot of the relief, in accordance with the<br/>
peculiar Egyptian system of perspective. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert-station </span>immediately beside the hind <span style="color: #ff0000;">boots </span>of the king's horses is called Migdol of<br/>
King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramenma</span>. (Migdol is a Semitic word meaning a fortified tower<br/>
generally.) Between the hind and forelegs of the horses appears<br/>
another fortress, called the castle of the lions. The train of <span style="color: #ff0000;">returns<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ing </span>warriors is separated from their Egyptian fatherland by a canal<br/>
full of crocodiles. That this is not merely an arm of the Nile is <span style="color: #0000FF;">indicated </span>by an inscription above the bridge, to the right, which<br/>
names it <span style="color: #ff0000;">To </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tenet</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ce</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">literally'the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cutting</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The crocodiles, which<br/>
do not live in salt water, show that this canal was supplied from<br/>
the Nile; and the two groups of figures on the farther bank show<br/>
that it marked the boundary of Egypt. In the upper group are<br/>
priests and grandees, with curious <span style="color: #0000FF;">nosegays </span>in their <span style="color: #0000FF;">hands</span>, who<br/>
await the Pharaoh with low obeisances; in the lower group the<br/>
women raise their hands in greeting to the returning king, who<br/>
brings with him their husbands and sons. The inscription runs:<br/>
'The priests, the great ones, and the princes of Upper and Lower<br/>
Egypt approach to welcome the good god (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ale</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the king) on his <span style="color: #0000FF;">return </span>from the Syrian land, with enormous booty. Never has <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
