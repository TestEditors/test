<br/>
</span>temple to Perseus, worshipped him with Hellenic rites and held games<br/>
in his honour<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The citizens <span style="color: #0000FF;">slain </span>ed Perseus as a native of their town<br/>
and told the <span style="color: #ff0000;">garrulons </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Helicarnassian </span>that he had visited Khemmis, when<br/>
on his way to Libya in pursuit of the Gorgon's head, and had recognised<br/>
them as his <span style="color: #0000FF;">kinsmen</span>. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">statue </span>of him stood in the temple. From time<br/>
to time the hero revisited Khemmis, leaving, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>sign of his presence,<br/>
his sandals<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>which were <span style="color: #0000FF;">two </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">elle </span>long; <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">finding </span>of these was considered a portent of good fortune<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The festival of <span style="color: #0000FF;">pole-climbing</span>, celebrated <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>honour of Khem, probably suggested his <span style="color: #0000FF;">identification </span>with the<br/>
Greek Pan. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>is obvious that Perseus has been confused with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>,<br/>
the destroyer of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Typhonbeth</span>. Among the various forms assumed by the<br/>
'Libyan Monster<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>in his long battle with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns </span>was that of a dragon or<br/>
serpent, while Horus, like Perseus, was supported by wings in his encounter<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>hence the mistake of Herodotus. In any <span style="color: #ff0000;">case </span>he is excusable<br/>
for seeking in Egypt the home of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Persons</span>, whose genealogy may be traced<br/>
back to lo<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>It is an interesting fact that a later author states that the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Person </span>tree was first planted in Egypt by Perseus. As no goat-footed<br/>
deities have been so far discovered in the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">me</span>, it is somewhat<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to explain how Khem came to be identified with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Palm</span>, unless on<br/>
account of his <span style="color: #ff0000;">Priapian </span>characteristics. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pam </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>at Khemmis<br/>
first received and disseminated the news of the death of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris </span>and hence,<br/>
says Plutarch, the sudden dread and confusion of a multitude is <span style="color: #0000FF;">called<br/>
</span>panic. Akhmim is thus the true home of Panic Fear. A white <span style="color: #0000FF;">bull </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>black cow were sacred to Khem. He appears in the triad along with the<br/>
child Horns and Isis <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sekhet</span>, surnamed <span style="color: #0000FF;">tarps</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">trepha</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>whence the Greeks<br/>
may have formed the name <span style="color: #ff0000;">Triptsis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Trypmmm </span>was also a <span style="color: #0000FF;">cognomen </span>of<br/>
some of the queens of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemaic </span>line.<br/>
<br/>
Khemmis still flourished in the Roman period, and its ancient<br/>
and famous temple was finally completed in the 12th year of Trajan.<br/>
After Christianity established itself here, the vicinity of Panopolis<br/>
became crowded with <span style="color: #ff0000;">convents</span>. Nestorius, Bishop of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Constantinople</span>, who had been banished to the oasis of Hibeh (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khdrgeh</span>,<br/>

motherhood of the Virgin Mary, was attached there by the plundering Blemmyes, and carried captive into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebaid</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">.where </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he<br/>
</span>surrendered himself to the prefect of Panopolis, to avoid a charge<br/>
of wilful flight<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He died in <span style="color: #ff0000;">PanopoliSwAkhmim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Even after the<br/>
conquest of Egypt by <span style="color: #ff0000;">lslam</span>, the temple of the'great town<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>of<br/>
Akhmim was, as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ahulfeda </span>and other Arabs relate, among the most<br/>
important remains of the days of the Pharaohs. Edrisi gives the<br/>
following account of it:'At Akhmim we see the building called the<br/>
Barbe (<span style="color: #0000FF;">as</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Perpa</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Septic </span>for temple), which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>Hermes erected<br/>
