<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">distinguished </span>for the beautiful modelling of the kings horses dashing into the fight, and for the representation of the Asiatic fortress<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tapers</span>, which is stormed by the Egyptians on <span style="color: #ff0000;">scaling-ladders</span>,<br/>
while the defenders are hurled headlong from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">battlements</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Several </span>sons of the Pharaoh, the names of whom are given, distinguish<br/>
themselves in the battle. Two of these (towards the left) are <span style="color: #0000FF;">depicted </span>on a larger scale than the others, viz. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khanem</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">us</span>, the favourite son of Ramses, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Menth</span>, prince of the blood, each of whom<br/>
is in the act of slaying an enemy. The younger princes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mari-Amen</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Aman-era-as</span>, Seti, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Setters-Rs</span>, covered with their shields,<br/>
take part in the attack (below the fortress). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span>apparently<br/>
had this scene in his mind when he described the Egyptian army as<br/>
commanded by the sons of the king.<br/>
<br/>
The reliefs at the side of and above the portal (adorned with<br/>
the concave cornice) in the Rear <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall </span>are in good preservation.<br/>
Each pillar is divided <span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">four </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fields</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>In the first (top) <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>the<br/>
king is shown <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sour-Osiris </span>(on the left) and to <span style="color: #ff0000;">PM </span>(on<br/>
the right); in both the second <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>he <span style="color: #0000FF;">odors </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>to Amman<br/>
Generator; and in the third to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-Ra </span>as king of the gods <span style="color: #0000FF;">Writ</span>)<br/>
and to the same god as lord of heaven (right)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>From the fourth<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fields </span>we learn the use to which the following rooms were <span style="color: #0000FF;">put</span>; on<br/>
the left is <span style="color: #0000FF;">enthroned </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ibismheaded </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ThothmHermea</span>, god of wisdom<br/>
and of writings; on the right (opposite) is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Safekh</span>, goddess of history<br/>
<br/>
(recognizable by <span style="color: #ff0000;">the'21 </span>above her head), named here'the king's<br/>
<br/>
mother <span style="color: #ff0000;">Safekh</span>, the great mistress of <span style="color: #0000FF;">book-writing</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At the foot is<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicatory </span>inscription, informing us that the king erected this<br/>
palatial building to his father <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, king of the gods and lord<br/>
of heaven, prince of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- On each side of the door is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">procession </span>of youthful forms, with the lock of hair hanging to the side,<br/>
peculiar to the royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">childish</span>. Their left hands are raised, and their<br/>
<br/>
right hands hold the herdsman's crook T, the symbol of princely<br/>
<br/>
dignity, and the fan, the symbol of <span style="color: #0000FF;">court-rank</span>. The list to the<br/>
<br/>
right is the more complete; but at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>of the procession <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the<br/>
left two princesses appear, who are wanting in the other<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Over the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">figures </span>but applying equally to the others appear the full titles<br/>
of Egyptian royal princes<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The first is as follows:'The <span style="color: #0000FF;">fan-bat </span>the right hand of the king, the prince and royal scribe, the leader<br/>
