briefly noted that after the reigns of Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">IE</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and his weaker son<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenptah </span>(under or more probably after whom the Exodus of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Israelites </span>took place), rebels and revolutionists reduced the house of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span>,<br/>
restored order with a firm hand. After <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>reign of seven years he died,<br/>
leaving the once more prosperous kingdom to his son Ramses III. The<br/>
temple which we are on the point of inspecting is a biographical authority<br/>
of the greatest value, for its inscriptions and representations not only<br/>
inform us of the warlike achievements of Ramses 111., but enable also<br/>
the attentive beholder to form a distinct picture of the peculiarities of<br/>
the public and private life of this prince. Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>is the wealthy<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Rhampsinitus </span>of Herodotus, the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">splendour-loving </span>of all the Pharaohs,<br/>
a timid favourite of the gods, whom he <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to propitiate <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>overwhelming the temples and priestly colleges with gifts, while in the<br/>
building of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Habu </span>he shows himself to have been a ruler given<br/>
over to self-indulgence<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The victories <span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>under him were important,<br/>
and it almost <span style="color: #ff0000;">seems </span>as though this luxurious ancestor of a degenerate<br/>
race recovered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">manhood </span>of his forefathers amid the tumult of battle.<br/>
<br/>
a. Pavilion of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>

</span>We first enter a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fons- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â« </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Count</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>A), with two small<br/>
buildings, which were probably the Porters<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>Lodges. Both these<br/>
and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">girdle-wall </span>stretching towards the S. are surmounted by<br/>
round pinnacles, resembling those already noted in the pictures of<br/>
Asiatic strongholds stormed by the Egyptian armies (<span style="color: #ff0000;">6.9. </span>on the ist<br/>
pylon of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>. These small buildings bear (behind,<br/>
above the lintel) the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartouches </span>of Ramses IL, Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">m.</span>, and<br/>
Ramses IV. Passing between the porters<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>lodges, we are confronted<br/>
with another building almost in the shape of a horse-shoe, which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">differs </span>considerably from the pylons of other temples. It consists of<br/>
truncated pyramids, with almost imperceptibly sloping walls, and<br/>
a slightly receding central <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>An excellent survey of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiar </span>structure, which contains numerous apartments, may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">obtained </span>from <span style="color: #0000FF;">without</span>, as there is an open space of <span style="color: #0000FF;">about</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fe </span>between<br/>
it and the entrance between the porters' houses. The French <span style="color: #ff0000;">can<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">plorers </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">have </span>given this <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice </span>the name of Pavilion, and it is now<br/>
generally regarded as the dwelling of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IIL</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>on <span style="color: #0000FF;">M'.count </span>of the reliefs in the interior representing scenes from the<br/>
private life of the Pharaoh <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">camp </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">13</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>174). The apartments were<br/>
probably designed for the reception of the king when engaged<br/>
in festal <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebrations </span>and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">ancestor</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">worship</span>. As has been said<br/>
before, there were no regular royal palaces on this bank of the Nile.<br/>
The royal dwellings looked very <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>from the temple of Medinet<br/>
Hahn, and were never built of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hewn </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stone</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>To the W. opens the<br/>
Gate <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span>, of lesser height. This led from the pavilion to the temple<br/>
proper, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span>a view of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>court.<br/>
