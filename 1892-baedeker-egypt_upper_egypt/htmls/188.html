<br/>
In the second row, to the right, the king in his chariot dashes<br/>
against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">discounted </span>foe, and aims a blow at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hostile </span>leader,<br/>
distinguished by a feather<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Next the king on foot deals the finishing<br/>
blow with his lance to an <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer</span>, who has been brought to his knees.<br/>
To the left the victorious monarch fares homeward, preceded by<br/>
two rows of prisoners, <span style="color: #0000FF;">named'N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ante </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tahil </span>The small figure<br/>
behind the chariot is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crown</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">prince </span>Ramses. Then follows the<br/>
presentation of the prisoners, who are called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retennu </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tahennu<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">crystalwcolcured</span>, white), to Amman, Math, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>, who<br/>
also receive the captured gold and vessels. <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span>Similar <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>occupy the lowest row. To the right is the pursuit of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khota </span>in their chariots. The inscription above compares the king<br/>
to Sutekh and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boat</span>, to a wolf and a lion, that roams through the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">by-paths</span>, to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">bull </span>that destroys the enemy in their blood. To the<br/>
left <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>the homeward journey. The king leads captives on foot, and<br/>
behind him is a chariot containing <span style="color: #ff0000;">lettered </span>prisoners, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">preceded<br/>
</span>by two rows of the same. He brings his captives to the Theban triad,<br/>
who are here accompanied by the goddess Mat. There also are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ito</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tonne</span>, brought by the king from the land of Kheta'to <span style="color: #ff0000;">fill </span>the lordly<br/>
palace of Ammon'.<br/>

<br/>
We now return to the central row of lofty columns with the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-capitals</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>follow it eastwards to Pylon 111., which we pass<br/>
through on our way towards the sanctuary, like the more highly privileged worshippers admitted to the temple in early times. This<br/>
part of the temple has been terribly destroyed, but enough has been<br/>
left standing to <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span>an idea of the general arrangement. The<br/>
picturesque <span style="color: #0000FF;">client </span>of the ruinous scene is enhanced by the variety<br/>
of artistic forms employed, and by the tall and slender shape of the<br/>
largest obelisk <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Egypt, rising from the midst of the ruins, and<br/>
testifying to the past proud splendour of this truly royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, which<br/>
has been ruthlessly <span style="color: #0000FF;">trodden </span>under foot by the monotonous cycle of<br/>
years and shattered by war and earthquakes<span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>we<br/>
approach to the sanctuary the older are the parts of the temple we<br/>
traverse. The inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">afford </span>materials for ascertaining the date<br/>
of each <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>portion; while the practised eye will not find it<br/>
difficult to support the conclusions thus arrived at by comparison<br/>
of the successive styles of art<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>We here find the polygonal <span style="color: #0000FF;">pillar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">column </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finely </span>carved <span style="color: #0000FF;">bud </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">w </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span>, bearing clear and <span style="color: #ff0000;">unmistakeablo </span>evidence as to the idea, to which this order owed its<br/>
origin. The third pylon seems to have marked the limit of the<br/>
temple under the early empire, before the gigantic buildings of<br/>
the 19th Dyn. were added. The W. side of this pylon, within the<br/>
great <span style="color: #ff0000;">bypostylemball</span>, still shows the incisions <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wall<br/>
