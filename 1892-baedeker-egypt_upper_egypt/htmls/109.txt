<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">diderent </span>chapels are still easily distinguishable, partly from the<br/>
plan of the building, partly by the representations and inscriptions;<br/>
for from each of the seven doors a processional approach led through<br/>
the two hypostyle halls straight to the entrance of the corresponding chapel; while the representations on the columns flanking each<br/>
approach refer only to the deity to whom the chapel at the end of it<br/>
was dedicated. In the vaulted chapels, amid the fumes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">incense </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the murmuring of <span style="color: #0000FF;">muffled </span>singing, waited the ministering priests of the sanctuary, pouring out libations and uttering<br/>
benedictions as the processions wound along the aisles, either<br/>
bearing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mummy </span>to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">sanctified </span>or consisting of a group of <span style="color: #0000FF;">privileged </span>laymen bringing offerings to the Osiris gods for the soul's<br/>
welfare of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deceased.</span>--The <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedication </span>are inscribed on the<br/>
door-posts in the traditional forms and with little variation. Similar<br/>
vaults occur at Benihasan and Dér el-Bahri, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>also in the lids of<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagi </span>in the museum at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gireh</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>each case the <span style="color: #ff0000;">menuments </span>to which they belong serve funerary purposes; the shape <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>the vault is, however, intended to represent the vault of heaven,<br/>
which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris-soul </span>has to traverse, and they are usually decorated<br/>
with stars. An inscription preserved on one of the vaults of the<br/>
sanctuary informs us that the Pharaoh erected this structure for his<br/>
father Osiris in the interior of the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-ma-men </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitted<br/>
</span>up the chapel to resemble the heaven of the ninefold deities, <span style="color: #ff0000;">imi<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tating </span>its constellations, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The internal fitting up and appearance of the chapels very little<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">As </span>the<br/>
middle place had to be assigned to Amman, the chief of the gods, it was<br/>
necessary to mark the special dignity of Osiris, to whom indeed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tem </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">le<br/>
</span>was consecrated, by making his chapel (Pl. d) wider than the others. he<br/>
rear-walls of the latter are, in each case, occupied by two <span style="color: #0000FF;">niche</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>with a<br/>
lotus-flower between them, from which rises the <span style="color: #0000FF;">slander </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">form </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oi </span>Osiris,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">symbolising </span>the blossoming of the soul in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a'ha </span>pier sphere<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">back </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>of the sanctuary of Osiris, however, is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">our</span>, leading to <span style="color: #0000FF;">attractors<br/>
</span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">m. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IO </span>which, including the adjoining smaller <span style="color: #0000FF;">columned </span>chambers, is as wide<br/>
as the whole sanctuary. This was the scene of the mysterious rites <span style="color: #0000FF;">celebrated </span>in honour of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Divine-Deceased </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris</span>, whose name even the Greek<br/>
Herodotus shrank from breathing) by the esoteric <span style="color: #0000FF;">9:385</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>of the highest class<br/>
(see <span style="color: #0000FF;">Brewster</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lower- </span>Egypt, p. 124). The inscriptions in the chapels inform<br/>
us that the priestly <span style="color: #0000FF;">processions </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1-</span>, which came from all parts of the kingdom,<br/>
made a complete circuit of the chapel, keeping to the right <span style="color: #ff0000;">Well </span>on entering<br/>
and returning to <span style="color: #ff0000;">We </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">duo</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mung </span>the door along the left wall. Thirty-six rites <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>ceremonies<br/>
had to he <span style="color: #0000FF;">perfumed </span>during this circuit. First came a recitation to prove the<br/>
worthiness of the worshipper to approach the holy place and the image of<br/>
the god. Then the veil was lifted. The worshipper was next allowed to<br/>
witness the <span style="color: #0000FF;">investiture </span>of the god by the priests with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">mum</span>, garments,<br/>
ornaments, and the attributes of his divine ower. Not before this was<br/>
accomplished did the pilgrim prostrate <span style="color: #0000FF;">himself </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>adoration, <span style="color: #0000FF;">brin</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">libations</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">burnt-offerings</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The hymns to be <span style="color: #ff0000;">song </span>at these<br/>
ceremonies are all prescribed, and the pictorial representations show how<br/>
the gods were to be clothed and in what attitudes they were to <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>worshipped. Possibly all these rites were performed only by the priests of<br/>
