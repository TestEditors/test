</span>obese appearance, <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>daughter, as well <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>a donkey, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">carry </span>the<br/>
princess on her travels. Unfortunately this piece of wall has been destroyed by tourists, and only a small fragment showing the princess and<br/>
her husband is preserved in the museum at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gizeh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The representation ends with a settlement of the inhabitants of Punt.<br/>
It lies close to the water which is populated <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>fish turtles, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">crayfish</span>,<br/>
and it would seem as if <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inhabitants </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">we</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'re </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lake</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dwellers</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>At all events<br/>
their conical houses rest upon piles. The door could only <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>reached by<br/>
a ladder, which the artist has not forgotten to represent. Palms <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">insense-trees </span>give shade to the village. In this southern <span style="color: #0000FF;">landscape </span>appear, or<br/>
rather used to appear, on the right a cow reclining, and on the left a <span style="color: #0000FF;">longtailed </span>bird flying through the air.<br/>
<br/>
The third terrace was formed by the roof of this hall, on the<br/>
inner wall of which were the above-described paintings, together<br/>
with a Temple, placed in the centre <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>supported by round columns<br/>
and by the ground behind. From this terrace <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>well-preserved<br/>
granite doorway leads to the burial chambers lying behind (see<br/>
below.<br/>
<br/>
At) the end of this terrace to the left there is a remarkable small<br/>
Sanctuary dedicated to the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather</span>, and built by <span style="color: #0000FF;">liaison </span>and<br/>
her <span style="color: #0000FF;">husband-brother </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, which should not be left unvisited.<br/>
The two outer rooms are in <span style="color: #0000FF;">mine</span>, so that even the partition-walls<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">betweeen </span>the halls lying one behind the other are scarcely <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognizable</span>. Some of the pillars and bases of the columns, however, are<br/>
still upright. We turn to the right and <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>the remains of a Hathor<br/>
Cow. There are also some more paintings of ships, but very faint.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the outer wall of the temple built into the mountain, is an ex<br/>
licking the hand of king, <span style="color: #0000FF;">is</span>. queen Remake. As the adjoining<br/>
text says,'She licks Home to whom she gave birth'. To the right<br/>
of the door is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-men-kheper-ka</span>), and within <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>II. who built the door and gave his name to it.<br/>
<br/>
The Burial Chambers lying behind are reached through an <span style="color: #0000FF;">antechamber </span>with two small niches <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>each side<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This is succeeded by<br/>
another long room with a flat blue ceiling, ornamented with red stars<br/>
at one time probably gilt. On each side of this funeral chamber<br/>
are niches. Next is a narrow <span style="color: #0000FF;">room </span>with two niches. At the back<br/>
of this last on the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-walls </span>above the shaft is an exceedingly<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting'Representation </span>of Queen <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>, drinking the milk of<br/>
life from the udders of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather </span>Cow. The cow is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>piece<br/>
of animal painting which has come down to us from Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity</span>. The cartouche of the queen was erased, probably by order<br/>
of her indignant ward <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111. </span>when he became independent.<br/>
All the inscriptions and paintings in this room (<span style="color: #ff0000;">cynooephali</span>, lions,<br/>
etc.) are perfect in style; those in the niches tell us that these were<br/>
used for the storing of <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>The last or Fourth Terrace is badly preserved<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>We first come to<br/>
a granite doorway built by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IIL </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">en </span>the central path, on the<br/>
left hand side of which we see an inscription of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">3rd </span>year of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Merenptah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>Next we reach the tower and fragments of <span style="color: #ff0000;">well</span>, both<br/>
of rough Nile bricks, belonging to the monastery or <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">church </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
