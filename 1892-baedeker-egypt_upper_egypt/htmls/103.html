<span>56 Route <span style="color: #ff0000;">4. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">names</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mcmnonium<br/>
<br/>
</span>of the Pharaohs just as at the neighbouring <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemais </span>divine honours<br/>
were paid to the deceased princes of Macedonian <span style="color: #0000FF;">origin</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>It was<br/>
natural enough that in a sanctuary devoted to purposes of this kind<br/>
no boisterous festivals or ceremonies should take place, and we are<br/>
not surprised to learn that neither singer nor flute-player nor <span style="color: #0000FF;">lute </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">player </span>was allowed within its walls<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The great building of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos</span>, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>sight, impresses neither<br/>
by its size nor by its beauty<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">walk </span>consist of <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine-grained<br/>
</span>limestone, while a harder material (sandstone) has been selected for<br/>
the columns, architraves, <span style="color: #0000FF;">door-posts</span>, and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">burden-bearing<br/>
</span>parts<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The foundations are nowhere more than 41/2 ft. thick, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>the platforms on which the columns rest are equally shallow<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Numerous blocks have become disjointed, owing, as Mariette has<br/>
shown, to the giving way of the dove-tails of sycamore wood<br/>
with which they were fastened. The inscriptions of Seti and the<br/>
earlier ones of his son and successor show great purity of style, but<br/>
this quality disappears in the later <span style="color: #ff0000;">tents </span>of the latter. It has been<br/>
established that a sanctuary of some importance stood at Abydos<br/>
even in the days of the ancient empire, and indeed we hear of its<br/>
restoration in that remote epoch. Our witness is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">stale</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">now </span>in<br/>
the Louvre, on which <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ameniscneb</span>, a priest <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>architect, who lived<br/>
in the reign of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertesen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span>. (12th <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dye</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span>, records the fact that <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
</span>renewed the colouring <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>inscriptions in the temple of Abydos<br/>
from top to bottom. This probably means the building of which<br/>
some fragments, belonging to the 12th Dynasty, are seen to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N.<br/>
</span>of the Memnonium (see p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">87</span>). Under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos </span>the ancient<br/>
sanctuary was entirely neglected, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the only record here of the<br/>
18th Dynasty, which was almost wholly absorbed by its wars and<br/>
foundations in Thebes, is an inscription of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">HI</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>,<br/>
however, of the 19th Dynasty, built an entirely new temple, and<br/>
his son Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>completed the adornment that his father left<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-plan </span>of the structure is unusual, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">differs<br/>
</span>materially from that of other great Egyptian temples. Among the<br/>
features, however, which it has in common with these are the<br/>
pylons, a first and second <span style="color: #0000FF;">fore-court</span>, hypostyle halls, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sane-v<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">teary</span>. The last, however, is much more richly articulated than<br/>
usual. The wing to the S. (to the left on entering) <span style="color: #0000FF;">forme </span>an <span style="color: #0000FF;">new<br/>
</span>curate right angle with the main <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The whole structure <span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span>in<br/>
the shape of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">masonic </span>square.<br/>
<br/>
We enter the temple from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">RE</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the<br/>
walls enclosing Court <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>are in ruins. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coons</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>B, which <span style="color: #0000FF;">open</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>to the<br/>
S. on the temple proper, is in better preservation. The sons and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">daughters </span>of Ramses H. were represented on the right and left walls,<br/>
but the figures and inscriptions have been almost <span style="color: #0000FF;">effaced</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>In spite<br/>
of the fact that all the inscriptions and representations here refer to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramsas </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span>, it has been proved through the discovery by Mariette<br/>
of a dove-tail (see above) bearing the name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">l.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
