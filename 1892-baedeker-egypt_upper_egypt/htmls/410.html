<span style="color: #0000FF;">loving </span>his mother), lord of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span>, and before Apt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Beneath are<br/>
three large warlike scenes. The first represents the king in his<br/>
chariot at the storm of a fortress. The horses with handsome harness<br/>
are <span style="color: #ff0000;">gaIIOping</span>, while the king launches an arrow against the fortress.<br/>
Above him is the guardian vulture, and behind him are his three<br/>
sons <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amhikhopcshf</span>, Ramses, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rehiuansmif</span>, with their shieldbearers in chariots. The defenders of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Weil-drawn </span>fortress are<br/>
pierced by arrows; one is falling from the walls<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A herdsman takes<br/>
to flight with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">haul<br/>
<br/>
</span>Beside the <span style="color: #ff0000;">king</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>horses are the words, referring to the king:'The<br/>
good god, son of Ammon, the advancing lord of the sword, protector of<br/>
his soldiers, shield of the fighters, bravely knowing the place of his hand,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">firm </span>in his war-chariot like the lord of Thebes, a lord of victory he <span style="color: #0000FF;">clays<br/>
</span>hundreds of thousands, one <span style="color: #0000FF;">bull </span>against <span style="color: #0000FF;">number-less </span>(foes), he sweeps<br/>
away the <span style="color: #0000FF;">confederates</span>, he defeats the rebels on the summit of their<br/>
mountains, he penetrates into their valleys like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">grasshopper</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Thou<br/>

with the royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">sickle</span>'.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>second picture exhibits the king on foot, treading upon a<br/>
prostrate enemy, and piercing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Syrian </span>with a lance so that his<br/>
blood gushes forth. The king is represented as a young man of<br/>
vigorous frame, probably as at the beginning of his warlike career.<br/>
<br/>
The inscription runs:'The good god who breaks in pieces the nine<br/>
tribes of the bow, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">exterminate</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the lands of the N., <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">strong </span>hero<br/>

<br/>
The third picture exhibits the triumphal return of the king<br/>
from battle. His chariot is preceded by two rows of fettered captives...<span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>black and brown people from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Nubians <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Sibdtmuss </span>)--clad in skins and wearing <span style="color: #0000FF;">tapa </span>of straw or <span style="color: #0000FF;">reads</span>. The<br/>
king follows calmly in his chariot<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>his horse, named <span style="color: #ff0000;">chhtu </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cm </span>was<br/>
(Victorious in Thebes), paces proudly along; and beneath the horse<br/>
is the king's lion, which accompanied him in battle<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The inscription is as follows<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span>living and good god, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">tamer<br/>

<br/>
A large picture on the opposite (<span style="color: #ff0000;">N</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>wall) deals with the warlike<br/>
events connected with the storming of the fortress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Katerh</span>, on the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Grantee </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Aranuta</span>), with which we have already become acquainted<br/>
in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Remesseum </span>(p. 161), and at Luxor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak</span>, and Abydos.<br/>
<br/>
In the upper half of the picture the besieged <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortress </span>is depicted, with<br/>
the king, bending his bow, attacking it on the left. The E <span style="color: #ff0000;">yptian </span>chariots<br/>
surround that of the king. Beneath the fortress are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ivisions </span>of the<br/>
army of the Kheta (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hitches</span>) and their allies, of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">0<br/>
