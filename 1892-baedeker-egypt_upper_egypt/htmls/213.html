<span>154 Route 12, <span style="color: #ff0000;">moses</span>. West <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bank</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>seated are <span style="color: #0000FF;">carved </span>out of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>pebbly <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">quartsose </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sandstonemconm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">glomerate</span>, of a yellowish-brown colour and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sexy </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to work.<br/>
The S. Colossus is in better preservation than the N. one, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but<br/>
</span>there is little <span style="color: #0000FF;">difference </span>between them in point of size<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The dimensions of the former, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>which the original form is more easily seen,<br/>
are as follows: height of the figure, <span style="color: #0000FF;">62 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span>, height of the pedestal on<br/>
which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot </span>rest, 13 <span style="color: #ff0000;">in</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">height </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">entire </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">monument</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">64 </span>ft<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>But when the figure was adorned with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">longwsirlce </span>vanished<br/>
crown, the original height may <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>reached 69 ft. The legs from<br/>
the sole to the knee measure 191/2 ft., and each foot is <span style="color: #0000FF;">10</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>long<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The breadth of the shoulders is <span style="color: #ff0000;">193/4 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">it</span>; the middle finger<br/>
on one hand is <span style="color: #0000FF;">4</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">n</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>long; and the arm from the tip of the<br/>
finger to the elbow measures 151/2 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>. The entire colossus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">including </span>the throne and pedestal, weighs 1175 tons.<br/>
Both statues face <span style="color: #0000FF;">E.S.E</span>. and stand parallel to the course of the Nile,<br/>
though they are no longer <span style="color: #0000FF;">perpendicular </span>as one <span style="color: #0000FF;">innings </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">little </span>towards<br/>
the other and both are canted slightly backwards<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The S. colossus is a<br/>
little in front of the N. one, from which it is 22 paces distant. Both are<br/>
seamed with cracks. and such large fragments have fallen from them, that<br/>
one could imagine that an attempt has been made to destroy them by fire.<br/>
The Arabs call the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>colossus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tame</span>, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">8. </span>one <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shame</span>, and both together <span style="color: #ff0000;">Salamdt</span>, or'the <span style="color: #0000FF;">greetings</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>When the Nile is at its highest, its waters reach the soles of the feet<br/>
of the colossi and sometimes the upper surface of the pedestal on which<br/>
they rest. As this pedestal is 13 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>high and as the statues must have<br/>
been beyond the reach of inundations in the time of the Pharaohs, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lopsius<br/>
</span>is correct in assuming from his observations of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nilometer </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Scrunch<br/>
</span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">342</span>) that the bed of the Nile at that point <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>have been considerably<br/>
raised within historical times. He estimates the total rise at <span style="color: #0000FF;">225 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In<br/>
</span>winter, however, the traveller reaches the statues <span style="color: #0000FF;">dry-Shad</span>. These <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossi<br/>
</span>were not always solitary monuments, remote from all other buildings. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On<br/>
</span>the contrary they originally stood on either side of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">gigantic </span>Pylon, which<br/>
rose behind them and formed the entrance to a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memnwsiem</span>, of which <span style="color: #0000FF;">extensive </span>relics still remain, though for the most part covered with earth.<br/>
This temple, now completely annihilated, was founded <span style="color: #0000FF;">b </span>Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>,<br/>
who is represented by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossi</span>. Neither this <span style="color: #0000FF;">monarch </span>nor his statues<br/>
have any connection whatever with the Greek Memnon, who was the <span style="color: #0000FF;">son<br/>
</span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eat </span>(the dawn) and Tithonus, became one of the allies of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Prim</span>, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">slew </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Antiloehns</span>, the brave son of Nestor, for which he was himself slain<br/>
by Achilles. Homer mentions <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span>Memnon twice in the Odyssey:<br/>
'For he thought in his mind of the likeness of the noble <span style="color: #0000FF;">Antilochus'<br/>
</span>'Whom the lordly <span style="color: #0000FF;">son </span>of the brightening <span style="color: #0000FF;">down </span>slew'.<br/>
<br/>
And of Neoptolemus, the son of Achilles, it is said: <span style="color: #0000FF;">i<br/>
</span>'No one handsomer than he have I seen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">next </span>to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">gudlike </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Memaoi</span>.<br/>
<br/>
This <span style="color: #ff0000;">Heinrich </span>was an Asiatic hero, who is said <span style="color: #0000FF;">also </span>to have built the<br/>
fortresses <span style="color: #0000FF;">of</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Echatana</span>. When the <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hem </span>became acquainted with<br/>
the Nile valley and its monuments, they imagined that they had found<br/>
sumptuous buildings of the Homeric hero in the commemorative <span style="color: #0000FF;">monuments </span>named'mennu' by the Egyptians (<span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">53</span>)<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossi </span>before us<br/>
were also <span style="color: #ff0000;">called'mcnnu</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>by the inhabitants of Thebes, and soon came to<br/>
be described by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hellenes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>statues of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monsoon</span>, though the Egyptians<br/>
even to a late period knew that they represented Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, a king<br/>
of the 18th Dynasty. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pausanias </span>was informed of this fact, and Greek <span style="color: #ff0000;">ins<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">scriptions </span>on the legs of the statues also mention it<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>When it <span style="color: #0000FF;">afterwards<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>That at least is the present name. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepsius </span>states that they were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">named-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>his <span style="color: #0000FF;">time </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">t5'anamdt</span>, or the'idols<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, which seems more in keeping<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">oral</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>conceptions<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
