<br/>
being then completed by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pelusiac </span>arm of the Nile. The canal,<br/>
frequently <span style="color: #ff0000;">sufiered </span>to fall into disuse, was restored by Nekho (7th<br/>
cent. <span style="color: #0000FF;">30</span>.) and at a later period by Darius <span style="color: #ff0000;">I. </span>Communication<br/>
between the Nile and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Red </span>Sea was maintained even under the<br/>
Arabs, but it was afterwards interrupted, and not restored until the<br/>
construction of the present fresh-water canal by Lesseps. The<br/>
bastions which defended it are those that compelled the Jews during<br/>
the Exodus to change their NE. <span style="color: #0000FF;">route </span>at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ethan </span>or Etam, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ate.the </span>fortified places (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Meters</span>), and to turn towards the Red Sea on<br/>
the S. The relief, which is gradually becoming more and more<br/>
indistinct, deserves careful study. The conqueror of the Semites,<br/>
who is here joyfully welcomed as he approaches in his chariot, is<br/>
the ancestor of the Pharaoh of the Bible narrative who perished in<br/>
the Red Sea.<br/>
<br/>
The victorious monarch next appears, after his arrival at Thebes.<br/>
As in the upper representation, he conducts to Amman two rows of<br/>
rebellious Asiatic princes, captured in the land of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Retennu</span>, and<br/>
presents to the god magnificent vessels<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>We have now returned to the door by which we left the hypostyle hall<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>It is adorned with the name of Ramses the Great.<br/>
To the right and left are two <span style="color: #0000FF;">colossal </span>companion reliefs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>which<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>is represented holding several rows of captives by cords, and<br/>
presenting the <span style="color: #0000FF;">weapons </span>of victory to King Seti, who raises his sword<br/>
against a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">fees </span>whom he holds by the hair<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mums-rings<br/>
</span>on both sides refer to the conquered tribes. The legend on the relief<br/>
to the left is noteworthy<span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>smites the great ones of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Anna<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Mentau </span>(with the symbols of the shepherds), all the remote regions,<br/>
all lands, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fenekhu </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">thnicians</span>) of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">region</span>, the Sati,<br/>
the great circle of the green <span style="color: #0000FF;">ocean</span>' (<span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span>. the Mediterranean <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sea</span>).<br/>
<br/>
We <span style="color: #0000FF;">turn </span>next to the representation on the RIGHT (<span style="color: #0000FF;">wo </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">SIDE </span>of the<br/>
door<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>To the extreme right, at the corner of Pylon <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, above, we<br/>
see the storming of Katesh in the land of Amara (the Amorites).<br/>
This is the fortress which <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>such serious resistance to the army<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ILL</span>, and it was the greatest obstacle to the victorious<br/>
progress of the Egyptian army in the wars of Seti and <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>son<br/>
Ramses. The scene is depicted with great vividness. The Aramaic<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fees </span>of the king (the Kheta) appear both on foot and in chariots;<br/>
and Seti overcomes his foes fighting also <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>foot and in his chariot.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">fees</span>, who wear curious peaked hoods, <span style="color: #0000FF;">bee </span>in wild <span style="color: #0000FF;">confusion<br/>
</span>The Egyptian artist here shows some appreciation of landscape<br/>
effects. A forest region is represented, though somewhat crudely,<br/>
with six different kinds of trees and shrubs. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">hard </span>of cattle belonging to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">terrified </span>by the approach of the king, <span style="color: #0000FF;">By </span>from<br/>
their pasture, accompanied by the herdsmen, who toss their arms<br/>
in despair. Katesh is taken, and the defenders are thrown from<br/>
the walls. This is the only relief that has been preserved in the<br/>
upper row<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
