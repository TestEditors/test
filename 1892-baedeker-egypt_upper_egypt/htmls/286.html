have been connected with the shaft of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diir </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tsi-tsum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span>, in which the<br/>
royal mummies were discovered.<br/>
<br/>
'21. From <span style="color: #0000FF;">man </span>el-Muh'ik to <span style="color: #ff0000;">ol-Asasif<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Der</span>.<br/>
<br/>
From Bib <span style="color: #0000FF;">e1-Multk </span>we need not return by the way we came,<br/>
but may take the path over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hill </span>which separates the Tombs of<br/>
the Kings from <span style="color: #0000FF;">D6</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-bahri </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">ole-Asasif</span>. The path, which cannot<br/>
be missed, begins at tomb <span style="color: #ff0000;">18</span>; from tomb 17 which every one will<br/>
visit, it is reached by going a few steps to the west. Persons not<br/>
equal to the climb may ride to the top, but it is a great strain upon<br/>
the donkeys. Riding down the hill is by no means to <span style="color: #0000FF;">393 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">recommended</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-boys </span>usually lead the animals by a narrow<br/>
path over the ridge, and await <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>travellers at the foot. The zigzag<br/>
path is fatiguing but safe, and is easily accomplished in 3/4 hr. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'5</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>View is most remarkable; first into the desolate valley of the Tombs<br/>
of the Kings, then from the summit and as we descend into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">peculiar </span>ravine of Dér <span style="color: #0000FF;">el-bahri</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>we see the steep projecting mountain<br/>
side with its tombs, and buildings old and new, with the rich green<br/>
of the fertile plain below spread out on both sides of the Nile, and<br/>
here and there its groups of palms and gigantic temples, as far as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kernels </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Luxor on the E. bank<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Those who are interested in the prehistoric <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone-age</span>, and the flint<br/>
implements of the childhood of the world, may notice at the beginning<br/>
of the path as well as on the top of the hill, and as they descend to Der<br/>
el-bahri, several open spaces covered with fragments of flint<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Lenormant<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Henry </span>considered these to be prehistoric <span style="color: #0000FF;">knife-manufactories</span>, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">myriads </span>of fragments lying about to be the work of man; but Lepsius<br/>
has proved that they are nothing more than the fragments of flint nodules<br/>
such as may now be seen lying about, which split owing to the rapid<br/>
changes of temperature. The traveller will in fact find thousands of<br/>
fragments resembling knives and scrapers. And this is only <span style="color: #0000FF;">natural </span>for<br/>
whether the splitting is due to nature or to art, the same shapes are likely<br/>
to be constantly produced. The calcareous limestone of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">hills </span>is full<br/>
of crystals of <span style="color: #0000FF;">silex</span>. The walls of the tombs may be remembered with<br/>
the dark broken nodules which stand <span style="color: #ff0000;">out </span>against the <span style="color: #0000FF;">light</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured </span>limestone. What <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hamy </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lenormant </span>took for <span style="color: #0000FF;">flint</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">manufactories </span>at the<br/>
entrance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bihan </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Multi</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>are only heaps of stone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>out of the rock<br/>
with metal tools at the making of the tomb. The fragments of limestone<br/>
and flint were necessarily removed from the excavations and were thrown<br/>
down on the sides of the valley<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the other hand <span style="color: #0000FF;">Virchew </span>assumes<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">prehistoric </span>Egyptian stone period, and considers the stone-fragments<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">df </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dér </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ei-baVi </span>to be to some extent <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificial </span>productions.<br/>
<br/>
Before turning to the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">al-balm</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>which is seen, with<br/>
the tower of <span style="color: #0000FF;">elay-bricks</span>, as we descend the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hill</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>visit should be<br/>
paid to the Necropolis lying between <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shékh'Abd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Kumah </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">o</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>190)<br/>

periods lie here in the series of low hills, which form the back as<br/>
