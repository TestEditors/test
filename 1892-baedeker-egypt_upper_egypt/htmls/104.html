<br/>
latter founded this <span style="color: #ff0000;">N. </span>part of the temple and left merely the <span style="color: #0000FF;">decoration </span>of it to his <span style="color: #0000FF;">son</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- The facade of the temple is of very<br/>
unusual form<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A row of <span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>limestone columns stand a short distance in <span style="color: #0000FF;">advance </span>of the temple wall, forming with it a kind of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pronaos</span>. In the time of Seti seven <span style="color: #0000FF;">doom</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponding </span>to the seven<br/>
chambers of the sanctuary (see below), pierced the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall</span>, which<br/>
was adorned with a cornice of its own<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>ceremonial occasions<br/>
the processions in honour of the king seem to have entered by the<br/>
door to the extreme left; the next served for processions to Ptah,<br/>
the third for <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, the fourth for Amman, the fifth for Osiris,<br/>
the sixth for Isis, and the seventh <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Home</span>. Ramses, however,<br/>
walled up six of these doors, leaving the central one alone, the<br/>
decoration of which had been begun by Seti, as the main entrance<br/>
to the temple. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">small </span>door in the Home gateway, to the extreme<br/>
right, is still open. The pillars bear huge figured representations<br/>
and a few inscriptions, which refer to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Soil </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1. </span>as <span style="color: #0000FF;">deceased </span>and introduce Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">H. </span>in the company of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman-site</span>, Osiris, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>, and<br/>
other gods. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics </span>inform us that Ramses erected this<br/>
part of the temple in honour of his father, one phrase, for instance,<br/>
reading:'The king of Upper and Lower Egypt, the Lord of the<br/>
Barbarians (Nine Nations), to make great the name of his father'.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">entrancewwall </span>behind the pillars <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirms </span>this pious filial wish<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond </span>the shadow of a doubt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the wall, to the left of the main<br/>
entrance, is a large and <span style="color: #0000FF;">conspicuous </span>inscription in <span style="color: #0000FF;">95 </span>vertical lines,<br/>
which, after the lists of kings, must <span style="color: #ff0000;">he </span>called the most important<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos</span>. It consists of two parts. In the first Ramses relates<br/>
how, on coming to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos</span>, he found his father's work unfinished<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>resolved to carry it to a conclusion. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">grandee</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span>rejoiced at<br/>
this resolution, and workmen and artists of every kind were <span style="color: #0000FF;">summoned </span>to aid in the task. In the second part Pharaoh recalls to his<br/>
consciousness all the honours he had paid and the gifts he had<br/>
presented to his father. The gods show him favour on account of<br/>
his <span style="color: #0000FF;">piece </span>acts and advance, one by one, to bestow upon him the<br/>
richest gifts of heaven: strength, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fearlessness</span>, victory, immortality,<br/>
etc. A picture accompanying the inscription represents Ramses,<br/>
with a crown on his head, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofiering </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices </span>to the goddess Ma and<br/>
to a <span style="color: #0000FF;">triad </span>consisting of Osiris, Isis<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and his father Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, who takes<br/>
the place of Horus. Recently deceased, Seti'appears as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">youthful<br/>
</span>god, the victorious opponent of the might of Death, who will soon<br/>
become Osiris, after <span style="color: #0000FF;">subduing </span>all his enemies beneath his feet. On<br/>
one of the pillars, indeed, Seti is already described as the'royal<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris</span>'. The inscription dates from the first year of the single<br/>
rule of Ramses and from the time of his first journey to Thebes,<br/>
when he erected statues of his father in the city of Ammon<br/>
and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memphis </span>At <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abydos </span>he <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>undertook the restoration of<br/>
his father's monumental structures in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis</span>, on the spot<br/>
specially sacred to Osiris <span style="color: #ff0000;">Unnefer</span>. After <span style="color: #0000FF;">mentioning </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">regtora<br/>
