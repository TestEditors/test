to the gods of the temple. Some of the resisting oxen are remarkably<br/>
true to nature<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Probably the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificial </span>animals were actually slain<br/>
in this court, a conclusion strengthened by the broken pottery found<br/>
here by Mariette and the two springs of turbid water<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A well has<br/>
also been discovered outside the E. wall of the temple, which may<br/>
be the spring described by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Strobe</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Room marked F on the plan is the most interesting of the<br/>
other apartments in this wing. The entrance to it is on the left<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">F</span>) side of the space between the sanctuary and the third row<br/>
of columns in the second hypostyle hall. The door leading to it is<br/>
named'the great door of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rennie-men </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">to</span>. Seti), the favourite of<br/>
Sokar'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>To this deity, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osiris-Sour </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptah-Sour-Osiris</span>, keeper of<br/>
the realm of shades, this room is consecrated, though other gods,<br/>
such as Nefer Tum, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home</span>, and Thoth are also represented here.<br/>
The king appears in the act of <span style="color: #0000FF;">adoring </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>To the extreme<br/>
right on entering, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>the wall between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">doom</span>, are reliefs of<br/>
richly adorned <span style="color: #ff0000;">Niiometcrs</span>, the symbols of the state of stability<br/>
and permanence aimed at by Pharaoh; the inscriptions inform<br/>
us that they were dedicated to the Osiris of the under-world, <span style="color: #ff0000;">PtahSukaruTatnnen</span>, who was worshipped in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium </span>of Abydos.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-wall</span>, to the right of the door, is the bark of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sekar</span>,<br/>
and a list is given of the titles of this god of the many aliases,<br/>
who was revered <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>so many <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>spots<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The form of the three<br/>
columns preserved here is peculiar. The cylindrical shafts, which<br/>
bear the abacus without any transitional member, are flattened at<br/>
the points where their periphery would touch an <span style="color: #ff0000;">cxscribed </span>square,<br/>
and hence their section is in the shape of an octagon with four<br/>
straight and four curved <span style="color: #0000FF;">sides</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">._._.. </span>The doors to the right, on each<br/>
side of the above-mentioned <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nilometers</span>, lead into two oblong rooms<br/>
with vaulted ceilings, which have partly fallen in (<span style="color: #ff0000;">P1</span>. q, r<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>The<br/>
other apartments of this wing contain nothing of special interest.<br/>
They are all ruinous, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>of them cannot be entered except from<br/>

should <span style="color: #ff0000;">bear </span>in mind that he has to do with a cenotaph, dedicated<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">manes </span>of a king <span style="color: #ff0000;">apetheosised </span>as Osiris and to his forefathers;<br/>
and he should also remember that the site of the building was determined by the belief that the souls of those who had <span style="color: #0000FF;">been'sanctified</span>' near the Holy Tomb could look forward with <span style="color: #0000FF;">confidence </span>to the<br/>
highest joys of the world to come.<br/>

erected a cenotaph to himself near the tomb of Osiris. To reach<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">skirt </span>the margin of the desert for a few minutes. It is in a very<br/>
ruinous state, but still presents many features of interest. The<br/>
ground-plan of a peristyle court, several rooms, and the sanctuaries<br/>
beyond them can still be traced; but the average height of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">remaining </span>walls is only <span style="color: #0000FF;">5'6 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>.
