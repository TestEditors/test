</span>towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, all the inhabitants of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ombo </span>went with him as his <span style="color: #ff0000;">cumpanions</span>, leaving the town by night. It was then the season for sowing.<br/>
When the wicked prince <span style="color: #0000FF;">mum </span>his vizier said to him,'All thy subjects<br/>
have left the country along with <span style="color: #0000FF;">my </span>brother; who will now plough the<br/>
fields?<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>The wicked prince was very angry when he heard that; but as<br/>
he was a great magician he said,'Then the dead must help me<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. So he<br/>
summoned the dead from their graves; and in the morning he beheld from<br/>
his castle (the temple) the dead at work, ploughing and sewing. But<br/>
when the harvest came, not a blade grew in the fields, for the dead had<br/>
carried the ploughs in the air above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">earth </span>and had sowed sand instead of grain. Then the wicked prince once more was angry and descended from his castle to convince himself with his own eyes of the<br/>
failure of the harvest. When he saw not only that no blade of corn <span style="color: #0000FF;">ew<br/>
</span>green, but also that the former fields were now covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">can</span>, he<br/>
uttered a terrible <span style="color: #0000FF;">cum </span>so fearful that his castle fell to the earth, and a<br/>
block of stone crushed him to death<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wim </span>Ombo is a Double Temple, and it is the<br/>
only one in Egypt that is divided along its longer axis into two distinctly <span style="color: #0000FF;">defined </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">parts</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Even the entrance has two <span style="color: #0000FF;">portals </span>In the interior<br/>
the various chambers are not approached as usual by one door each;<br/>
everywhere two doorways are seen, by broad pillars each of<br/>
which is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">point </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the imaginary <span style="color: #0000FF;">line </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">indicating </span>the division between<br/>
the two portions of the temple. The plan of the whole may be made<br/>
out with perfect certainty, though many of the rooms, especially<br/>
those towards the rear, are largely sanded up. The temple moreover<br/>
contained two sanctuaries, a fact which is scarcely surprising after<br/>
what has been said of the two chief deities, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arueris </span>and Sebek.<br/>
<br/>
The Hypostyle <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pronaos </span>.--<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Double Portal of the main<br/>
temple consists of two doors, framed by three columns and each<br/>
displaying a concave cornice and a winged <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun-disc</span>. The floor of<br/>
the hypostyle is encumbered with sand. Thirteen columns are still<br/>
standing, each of which measures no less than 20 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>round the<br/>
middle of the shaft. The two corner columns in front are apparently<br/>
wanting; there were in all three rows of five or perhaps three rows<br/>
of seven. The capitals, of great variety of form, belong to the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaiangyptian </span>order; but they differ in various points from<br/>
those to be seen at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Denderah</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edfn</span>. The middle column<br/>
in the back row has a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Calyx-capital</span>, with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">foliage-eup </span>displaying<br/>
a unique ornamentation, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>three flowers and three buds <span style="color: #0000FF;">springing </span>from it<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unfinished </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">calyxucapital </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>northerly<br/>
column in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">same </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Crass</span>) row has, at its base, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">month </span>of flowers<br/>
with serrated edges, between which are arranged pairs of buds, each<br/>
pair surmounted <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a <span style="color: #ff0000;">slam-pointed </span>star, though elsewhere the Egyptian star is always <span style="color: #0000FF;">five-pointed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">X</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
