<br/>
the feather of truth on their <span style="color: #0000FF;">heath </span>In two rows before and behind<br/>
the king appears the rest of the procession. In the upper row (before the king), a drummer and a trumpeter turn towards the <span style="color: #ff0000;">gran-dees </span>of the kingdom, who wear the double feather on their heads<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>in their hands the symbols of their power. The last of<br/>
these, a bald priest, with a <span style="color: #ff0000;">censor </span>turns towards the king. A<br/>
short inscription explains that he is offering incense to the Pharaoh,<br/>
and names <span style="color: #0000FF;">him </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fan-bearer </span>at the right hand of the prince, the<br/>
royal scribe, general, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">crown-prince</span>, whom he (Ramses) loves.<br/>
In the lower row are various dignitaries, preceded by two young<br/>
princes. These, according to the inscription above, are'the royal<br/>
relatives of the king, young and old; great and worthy, all <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>who<br/>
have appeared) to march before his majesty as he proceeds in his<br/>
litter, in order to cause his father Khem to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>carried in procession,<br/>
at his beautiful festival of the staircase'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Immediately before the<br/>
king is a priest, turning <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards </span>him and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>incense, and then<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">orator </span>of festivals (<span style="color: #0000FF;">kherheb</span>),'who performs all his customary<br/>
ceremonies before the king at his solemn procession<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>. Behind the<br/>
king, the procession is also arranged in two rows. In the upper<br/>
row are dignitaries, with the symbols of their rank, and armed<br/>
warriors; in the lower, royal princes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fan-bearers</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">pastophori<br/>
</span>with portions of the sacred staircase and cases containing sacred<br/>
vessels. At the <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>of the relief is a kind of grated door, with<br/>
a vertical inscription in front of it, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">effect </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wis </span>Majesty<br/>
arises solemnly, like the sun's disc, from his dwelling of life, <span style="color: #0000FF;">constancy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and power (in other words, his <span style="color: #0000FF;">palace</span>). The king <span style="color: #ff0000;">betakes<br/>
</span>himself in his litter to the abode of his father <span style="color: #ff0000;">thm</span>, to gaze upon<br/>
his beauties<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. Then follows the main object of the procession, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>.<br/>
the image of the ithyphallic Khem, who here stands beneath a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">narrow </span>crowned with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Uraeus-snakes</span>. Farther on towards the E.<br/>
wall, the image appears <span style="color: #0000FF;">home </span>by priests on a stand covered with<br/>
a <span style="color: #ff0000;">gailyucoloured </span>carpet and adorned with enormous wreaths of<br/>
flowers<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The priests, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>aloft fans of <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>shapes, are<br/>
completely covered by the carpet, with the exception of their heads<br/>
and feet. Behind and a little above, two priests spread out a sail,<br/>
the emblem of breath, freshness, and joy, and beneath them four<br/>
others bear a chest with five ornamental trees. Before the former<br/>
figure of the god the king, <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>incense and <span style="color: #0000FF;">drink-offering</span>,<br/>
wears the helmet of the ruler of Upper Egypt; while before the<br/>
image on the covered stand the Pharaoh, <span style="color: #ff0000;">bearing </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">staff </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sceptre<br/>
</span>and following a white bull, wears the crown of Lower Egypt. Above<br/>
him hovers the vulture of victory <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>in nearly every place where<br/>
the king appears in the present series), <span style="color: #ff0000;">bearing </span>in its talons the<br/>
symbol of the innumerable periods, which (according to the inscription beneath) <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-khern </span>has bestowed upon the Pharaoh<br/>
for his appearance at the festival. An inscription in front of the<br/>
sacred bull names it'the white bull'. Its horns are, <span style="color: #0000FF;">shape </span>like<br/>
<br/>
