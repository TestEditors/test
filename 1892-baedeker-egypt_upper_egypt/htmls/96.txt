<br/>
as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tmove-mentioned </span>Greek inscription informs us, to the old<br/>
temple of Pan, who is here <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented </span>in an ithyphallic form. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ala<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>all the inscriptions are rapidly becoming <span style="color: #0000FF;">effaced</span>, and the same<br/>
fate is overtaking a circle divided into twelve parts and <span style="color: #0000FF;">supposed </span>to<br/>
be intended for the Zodiac. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>the second temple of Khemmis,<br/>
which Herodotus describes as dedicated to Perseus, the only <span style="color: #0000FF;">remains </span>are a few stones of the 18th Dynasty and some scanty fragments of a building of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemaic </span>and Roman period. These are<br/>
reached by the water when the Nile overflows its banks and are<br/>
gradually being swept away.<br/>
<br/>
In 1884 <span style="color: #0000FF;">bloopers </span>discovered an extensive <span style="color: #ff0000;">NeeeopRit </span>adjoining a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Coptic<br/>
</span>monastery among the mountains to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NE</span>. of Akhmim. Thousands of<br/>
mummies have been taken thence and some of them were sent to Europe.<br/>
A visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis </span>is well worth undertaking. The best plan is<br/>
to secure the company of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khalil-Setter</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>keeper of the Egyptian Museum,<br/>
and ride with him to the N.E., in the direction of the mountains. On<br/>
a hill beyond the village of (<span style="color: #ff0000;">3/4 </span>hr.<span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l-Hawm'theh </span>we see the deserted Coptic<br/>
monastery, round which, in a wide circle, lie the tombs, now mostly<br/>
destroyed. They date from the 6th Dynasty (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pepiaaneh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">KNsausakhteta</span>,<br/>
Ankhu, etc.) down to the Greek and Roman period. The grave of Tutu,<br/>
son of Sit <span style="color: #0000FF;">aere </span>(daughter of Osiris), with liturgical inscriptions, is well<br/>
preserved (1885). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Most </span>of the mummies found here were in good <span style="color: #ff0000;">preserve<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ration</span>, and many contained rolls of papyrus. Among them were many<br/>
priests (<span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sud </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">priestesses </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mm </span>of Khem, whose genealogies are carried<br/>
up for eight or ten <span style="color: #0000FF;">generation</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The town of Akhmim has now become the seat of an active<br/>
trade in mummies. Objects of considerable interest and value may<br/>
often be obtained from the dealers in antiquities, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">relic-hunters<br/>
</span>should not try to make purchases in the presence of the keeper of<br/>
the museum.<br/>
<br/>
Continuing our journey up the Nile, we soon see, close to the<br/>
E. <span style="color: #0000FF;">bank</span>, a conspicuous <span style="color: #0000FF;">convent-village</span>, resembling a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fortress </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ort<br/>
</span>account of its whitewashed walls the sailors call it <span style="color: #0000FF;">Der </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el-Ahyad</span>,<br/>
a name that properly belongs to the monastery mentioned at p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">go</span>,<br/>
which lies much farther to the W. About 50 men, women, and<br/>
children occupy the convent, which has little of a religious character in its mode of life. The pretty little church, built of light<br/>
and dark bricks, is lighted by cupolas, the largest of which is above<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tha </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">newt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nave </span>is separated from the aisles by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wooden </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stream</span>.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">HÃ©kel</span>, or Holy of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Holies</span>, at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">it</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>end, is carefully enclosed.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the nave, below the dome, stands the <span style="color: #0000FF;">reading-desk </span>of the priests,<br/>
and at the W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>of the church, separated from the priests, are<br/>
the seats for the laity. The paintings are wretched, and there are<br/>
no old <span style="color: #0000FF;">MSS</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>but the church is an excellent specimen of a Coptic<br/>
place of worship and is worth visiting, especially as it is only<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>min. walk from the river. The monks are very <span style="color: #0000FF;">obliging </span>and are<br/>
grateful for a small donation (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">19.</span>, or more) <span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thoma</span>, which<br/>
was occupied by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Woman </span>garrison, must have lain in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">neighbourhood</span>.<br/>
