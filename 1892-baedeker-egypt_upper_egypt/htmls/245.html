<br/>
formerly supported by <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>columns in 4 rows of six, of which the central row was considerably thicker than the others. The roof, however,<br/>
has long fallen in, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>nothing remains of the columns save the plinths<br/>
and the lower part of the shafts. Two smaller chambers follow,<br/>
with four couples of columns, and then <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Central Apartment with four<br/>
pillars. On both sides these are adjoined by a series of rooms (<span style="color: #0000FF;">comp<br/>
</span>PL), of which those to the N. are accessible, those to the 8. covered<br/>
with rubbish except the two front apartments <span style="color: #0000FF;">on</span>. g). A special<br/>
door leads from the colonnaded hall to the latter, which are arranged<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">differently </span>from those on the N. These rooms have been carefully<br/>
examined by Prof. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diirniehisrti </span>and from the inscriptions in and near<br/>
them they are now known as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">TREASURY </span>of this Memnonium of<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">1H</span>. Even on the external walls of these apartments are<br/>
artistic representations of vases, jars, and other vessels in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">precious<br/>
<br/>
</span>metals.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">INTERIOR </span>of the treasury consists of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span>turned towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">t</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">widowed </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">each </span>side by two chambers. The inscriptions without exception<br/>
relate to the gifts of gold, silver, electrum, <span style="color: #0000FF;">malachite</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>and<br/>
other stones <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>Ramses III. <span style="color: #0000FF;">extravagantly </span>heaped upon Amman, so<br/>
that'the <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>of his gifts found no end'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Even those visitors who <span style="color: #0000FF;">do<br/>
</span>not understand the inscriptions will at once <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognize </span>that they are in a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure-house</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations </span>which adorn all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls</span>, especially<br/>
<br/>
those of the chambers on the right<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphic </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>nub means<br/>
gold <span style="color: #ff0000;">and'V </span>nub <span style="color: #0000FF;">her </span>white gold or <span style="color: #0000FF;">silver</span>. Whole heaps of these <span style="color: #0000FF;">metals<br/>
<br/>
</span>are seen lying in grains or nuggets<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Sacks of gold from different lands and<br/>
all <span style="color: #0000FF;">kinds </span>of precious vessels meet the eye<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Pieces of <span style="color: #0000FF;">lupin-lazuli </span>and<br/>
malachite shaped like <span style="color: #0000FF;">brick</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>are built up in stepped <span style="color: #0000FF;">mum</span>, each in three<br/>
rows. Arabian indiarubber (Kathi) <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the tree whence it is obtained are<br/>
also <span style="color: #0000FF;">depicted</span>. In the chambers on the right appear also sheets of silver,<br/>
and plates of brass and lead<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pharaoh </span>boasted ceaselessly that he<br/>
had <span style="color: #0000FF;">tilled </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tremors</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">house </span>of his father Amman; <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the god Thoth<br/>
(in the second chamber to the right) writing reckons it by the countless<br/>
hundreds of thousands and <span style="color: #0000FF;">lens </span>of thousands (a million altogether) in<br/>
silver, gold, brass, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lupin-lazuli</span>, malachite from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ream</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>(Sinai Peninsula),<br/>
etc., which he has <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>to his venerable father <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-Ra</span>, king of the<br/>
gods, who on his side has accorded to the king the periods <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ba </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the<br/>
years of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tum </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>--It is impossible not to recall the passage in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Diodorus's<br/>
</span>description of the tomb of Osymandyas (p. 159), in which the king is<br/>
represented as <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>to the divinity gold and silver to the value of <span style="color: #ff0000;">82<br/>
</span>million <span style="color: #0000FF;">mines</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Ramses III. was no other than the rich Rhampsinitus of Herodotus<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">H</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">1213</span>; and it is not impossible that we here stand before the very<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure-hears </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rhamprinites </span>which figures in the pleasant tale <span style="color: #0000FF;">narrated<br/>
</span>by the Father of History.<br/>
<br/>
Rhampsinitus the Pharaoh was possessed of such vast treasures that<br/>
he commanded a builder <span style="color: #ff0000;">to </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">erect </span>for their <span style="color: #ff0000;">safe </span>custody <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>stone building<br/>
beside the palace. The architect coveted the treasures, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>being a cunning<br/>
man <span style="color: #ff0000;">so </span>arranged a stone in the wall that two men, or indeed one, could<br/>
easily withdraw it<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Before his death he <span style="color: #0000FF;">impacted </span>the secret to his sons.<br/>
These immediately on the death of their father <span style="color: #ff0000;">betook </span>themselves to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure-house</span>, removed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone</span>, and favoured by the darkness of night,<br/>
succeeded in carrying <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>a large amount of <span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure</span>. They repeated their<br/>
visits, until the king remarked that his treasure was decreasing, without<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>however, being able to accuse anyone of the theft, as he invariably found<br/>
the seals unbroken and the doors <span style="color: #0000FF;">fut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Locked</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ea </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">maxim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l<br/>
