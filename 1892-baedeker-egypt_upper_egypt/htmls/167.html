<br/>
rubbed out. On the left (<span style="color: #ff0000;">E.</span>) wing, however, the life-like figure of<br/>
the king, shooting arrows from his chariot, and the fine rearing<br/>
horses of his chariot, are still clearly to be distinguished. On the<br/>
right <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W0 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>also a good deal may be made out<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The king is here<br/>
represented in his camp. He has dismounted from his chariot, which<br/>
waits for him, and has seated himself upon his <span style="color: #0000FF;">throne</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">His </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">officers<br/>
</span>await his instructions, and farther in the background the troops<br/>
rest in their camp. The inscriptions are much injured, but it can<br/>
be made out from them that they were <span style="color: #0000FF;">graven </span>in the stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly<br/>
</span>in honour of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s </span>victory over the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Aramaeans</span>) and<br/>
their allies. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the 5th year of the king, on the 9th Payni, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">fore<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tress </span>of Katesh on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Orontes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>stormed. The river and the<br/>
contest on its banks are still distinguishable. The Epic of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Persians<br/>
</span>in 90 vertical lines, covers the lower part of the W. wing and part<br/>
of the E. wing; some of it has recently been uncovered, the rest is<br/>
still concealed by rubbish. This poem was the national <span style="color: #0000FF;">epos</span>, the<br/>
Iliad, of the ancient Egyptians. It occurs twice on the E. bank <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
</span>Thebes--on the N. side of the pylon at Luxor and on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>side<br/>
of the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Karma </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>(here also partly concealed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">earth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>It is<br/>
also found, though in a very fragmentary condition, on the N. wall<br/>
of the temple of Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">H. </span>at Abydos (discovered <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eisenlohr</span>), and in the most complete (<span style="color: #0000FF;">hieratic</span>) form in the Papyrus<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Haifa </span>(now in the Louvre) and the Papyrus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Settles </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">111</span>. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>in<br/>
the British <span style="color: #0000FF;">Museum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)<br/>
<br/>
</span>The poetic text on the pylons at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luxor </span>is followed by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">prose<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">text</span>, dealing mainly with the arrival of two hostile spies, who gave<br/>
out at first that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta </span>had fled into the land of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khirabu </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Helm<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bon </span>or Aleppo) to the N. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tnnop</span>, but who on being scourged revealed the real <span style="color: #ff0000;">lurking-place </span>of the enemy to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. of Katesh.<br/>
The king hastily recalled the Egyptian troops, but too late to <span style="color: #0000FF;">prevent </span>his camp being suddenly attached <span style="color: #ff0000;">on </span>the S. by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span>. The<br/>
Egyptians were surrounded, and only the personal bravery of the<br/>
king secured the final victory. This prose inscription, preserved in<br/>
full at the Ramesseum and in the temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ahu-Simbel</span>, describes<br/>
the same event as the poem of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pentaur</span>, though it dates it a month<br/>
later<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The most important and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finest </span>episodes according to the restoration<br/>
of the text by E. <span style="color: #ff0000;">de </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Rhuge </span>are as <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Then </span>the miserable and<br/>
worthless <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kheta </span>with his numerous allies lay hidden behind the fortress<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Katesh </span>His majesty found himself alone (with his servants<span style="color: #ff0000;">) </span>The<br/>
legion of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>marched after him<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the legion of <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>passed through<br/>
the valley to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>of the fortress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shabtun </span>and marched forwards<br/>
<br/>
In the centre was the legion of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fish</span>, supported by the fortress<br/>
of Amara<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the legion of Sutekh (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Seth </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ty </span>hon) went upon <span style="color: #0000FF;">its </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">way<br/>
</span>The king had summoned all the leaders 0 his <span style="color: #0000FF;">may</span>, who were in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">valleys </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the land of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amour</span>. The miserable and worthless prince of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khata </span>was in the midst of his soldiers<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and for fear of His Majesty dared<br/>
not prepare himself <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>battle Yet he ordered forward <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span>archers and<br/>
his chariots, that were more in number than the sand of the sea shore. Three<br/>
<br/>
men were in each chariot, and they had united themselves with the warriors<br/>
of the land of the Kheta, expert with all <span style="color: #0000FF;">weapons </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">remained </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hidden<br/>
