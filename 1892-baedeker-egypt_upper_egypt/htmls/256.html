<br/>
</span>ing their arms in prayer, others kissing the dust. Among them are <span style="color: #ff0000;">sum<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">nuchs</span>, easily recognized by the fatty swellings on their breasts. The garments of the Asiatics are peculiar, white with coloured stripes down the<br/>
seems even of the sleeves. Many of them wear white bands on their <span style="color: #0000FF;">foreheads</span>. Their <span style="color: #0000FF;">profile </span>is strongly Semitic; the red pointed <span style="color: #0000FF;">beards </span>and the<br/>
hooked noses being carried almost to the point of caricatures. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Some<br/>
</span>bring cattle, others finely worked vases. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-em-heb </span>was a great<br/>
lover of flowers, as we learn from <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span>inscriptions in the first chamber<br/>
of his tomb.'<br/>
<br/>
In the Second <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hall </span>on the left inner <span style="color: #ff0000;">well </span>there is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>remarkably <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>picture of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-em-heb </span>on his chariot, the latter unfortunately<br/>
half obliterated. In his left hand he holds a long pointed <span style="color: #0000FF;">stair</span>, perhaps<br/>
for urging on his horses, in his right a golden necklace, with which he<br/>
has been decorated, his diploma (which is frequently mentioned), and the<br/>
reins<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the right hand side of the inner <span style="color: #ff0000;">well </span>there is a curious representation of an Egyptian party. There is an abundant provision of <span style="color: #0000FF;">food<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">drink </span>The servants in attendance carry flowers on the arm as modern<br/>
waiters carry napkins. The wife of this lover <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flowers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>green <span style="color: #0000FF;">had<br/>
</span>in her hair. The guests, two of them on easy chairs and three on stools,<br/>
are <span style="color: #0000FF;">od'ered </span>refreshments. Below, in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>row, the ladies are seated.<br/>
An attendant holds in each hand a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Maff </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">wreathed </span>and crowned with flowers,<br/>
and all the lady guests have blossoms in the hair and round the neck<br/>
and hold a lotus flower in the hand<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In the lowest row is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>music in <span style="color: #0000FF;">run </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">activity </span>It consists of two harpers, a man sitting and a<br/>
woman standing, a flute-player <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">lute-player</span>, both of them <span style="color: #0000FF;">woman<br/>
</span>standing<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>The women's faces, including those of the musicians, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">exceedingly </span>pretty. On the wall to the right are <span style="color: #ff0000;">fowlingwseenes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the Third Room the dwelling-house is represented, and its roof is<br/>
supported by a wooden pillar with a capital consisting of a rich variegated <span style="color: #0000FF;">flower </span>in red, white, and two shades of green, with two <span style="color: #ff0000;">campamtively </span>large buds on long stems projecting from the upper part of the<br/>
shaft. Below <span style="color: #0000FF;">lathe </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sledge </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sarcophagus </span>drawn by servants<br/>
and a white cow, and the arrival before Osiris. On the wall to the right<br/>
is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amen-em</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">heb</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>garden, in the centre of which, surrounded by plants, is<br/>
a pond with <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish </span>swimming in it. There is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>plentiful supply of flowers and<br/>
fruit, which the gardeners are preparing to carry into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">house<br/>
<br/>
</span>We <span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">second </span>still further to No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>, the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pehsnukher<br/>
</span>who was adjutant to the lord of both lands, colonel in the army,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">fanmbesrer </span>to the king<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In this tomb which has been for a long<br/>
time known, the colours are particularly well preserved. A large<br/>
party of ladies and gentlemen is represented. On the large <span style="color: #0000FF;">stole </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>festivals kept by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptians </span>are mentioned. <span style="color: #0000FF;">If </span>there is<br/>
time we may visit No. 39 (to the left), the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tomb </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Finer, not to be<br/>
confounded with the mayor of the same name of the time of Seti <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>,<br/>
at the foot of the hill<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>This <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pillar </span>was a companion of King <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen-hotep </span>IL, and followed him, it is said, into all countries by land<br/>
and water, and was therefore honoured with gifts<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>To the right and a little above the tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pebsn-Kher </span>(No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">M</span>,<br/>
see above) there is a deep pit into which one can <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>let down with<br/>
ropes brought from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dhahabiyeh</span>. The tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amtmomliit</span>,<br/>
who <span style="color: #0000FF;">has </span>here, is remarkable for some <span style="color: #0000FF;">hunting-Seamus</span>, and in the<br/>
inner chamber for copious extracts from the Book of the Dead,<br/>
written in <span style="color: #0000FF;">black </span>and red on white stucco. Ascending to the right<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">N</span>) we reach the tomb (No. 26) <span style="color: #ff0000;">of</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>prince <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ems-ha</span>) and<br/>
