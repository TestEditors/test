Ptolemaic columns, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Esther-masks </span>on the abacus. To the right<br/>
and left of this wide <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span>are two rooms, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>behind are three<br/>
others, the middle one of which gives access to the Sanctuary. The<br/>
inscriptions on the walls owe their origin to the Ptolemies; the<br/>
earliest, as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedication</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span>also informs us, to Ptolemy IX.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Euergetes </span>IL, and to Cleopatra, his sister <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>wife. The pregnant<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">hippopotamuagoddess </span>Apet was the goddess of births. Her <span style="color: #0000FF;">finely<br/>
</span>executed statue of serpentine, found in the ruins of the ancient<br/>
city, is now in the museum at Gizeh. It dates from the 26th <span style="color: #0000FF;">D </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nasty</span>. The inscriptions <span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'representations </span>refer largely to Osiris,<br/>
whose birth was commemorated here, and to the gods associated<br/>
with him. On the outside of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">templeuwall </span>and on the walls adjoining it are found the names of Ptolemy Auletes and the emperor<br/>
Augustus. <span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>list of homes, also found here, is unfortunately much<br/>

The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Temple </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Modernist</span>, at one time a large and beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, is<br/>
now so completely ruined that even its <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-plan </span>cannot be traced. The<br/>
village, a kind of suburb of Thebes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Teman </span>and lay to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N.<br/>
</span>of the temple. Month of Thebes was the god <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>worshipped here, but<br/>
Buto (<span style="color: #0000FF;">seal</span>) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">hpet </span>were also revered<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Um </span>erection of this temple dates<br/>
from the time of Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, of the 18th Dynasty. His name occurs<br/>
on the large granite'pillars which are still standing and which probably<br/>
formed part of the Sanctuary. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Numerous </span>blocks of granite lie scattered<br/>
around. The sanctuary was adjoined by a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice</span>, lying <span style="color: #0000FF;">approximately </span>from E. to W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Much </span>farther to the W. was a Pylon, facing the<br/>
river, but now destroyed, leaving nothing <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>a heap of blocks of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandstone</span>. Various fragmentary inscriptions in a good style inform us that<br/>
it was built by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sell </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1. </span>and Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">IL </span>Under the Ptolemies an addition<br/>
was made to the earlier temple, including the Colonnade, which is <span style="color: #ff0000;">new<br/>
</span>the most conspicuous and most interesting feature of the ruins. Five<br/>
columns are still standing. Four of these, on which still rests the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone<br/>
</span>architrave, appear to have bounded a <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>destroyed peristyle court and<br/>
to have formed the first row of columns in a hypostyle hall, which cannot<br/>
have existed before the time of the Ptolemies. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">column </span>is the<br/>
only relic of the second row<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Both this <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the two <span style="color: #0000FF;">bud-columns </span>(to the<br/>
left) in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>row appear to belong to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Â£11616</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Has </span>two latter<br/>

the artistic idea which dictated their form still retained a vigorous<br/>
freshness at the time of their erection. On the other hand the late <span style="color: #0000FF;">elaborate </span>plastic decoration of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">calyx~capitals </span>of the other two columns<br/>

</span>of barrier-like <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls</span>, half as high as the shafts, and crowned with a concave<br/>
cornice, and the treatment of the doors, whose absent covering was merely<br/>
indicated on both sides <span style="color: #ff0000;">b </span>erections with <span style="color: #0000FF;">concave </span>cornices, would in themselves be proofs that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">nilding </span>was not erected before the epoch of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>, even if the inscriptions did not contain the same information.<br/>
