<span>280 Route 28. FIRST CATARACT.<br/>
<br/>
sixty years of age<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>who <span style="color: #ff0000;">sat </span>with his long neck <span style="color: #0000FF;">erasing </span>forward so long<br/>
as we hovered in danger, and who, with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">eye </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span>sparkling with intense<br/>
excitement and his <span style="color: #0000FF;">lean </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bird-like </span>face, looked like an eagle on the look<br/>
out for prey. <span style="color: #0000FF;">All </span>went well at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first</span>. Only a man and boy, however,<br/>
were rowing on the left side, while two men were <span style="color: #ff0000;">rcwin </span>on the right.<br/>
As we <span style="color: #0000FF;">quilted </span>the second rapid and were entering a di <span style="color: #0000FF;">crest </span>channel,<br/>
the sailors on the left side had to row with all their strength; that,<br/>
however, proved inadequate and the stream swept the boat round, so that<br/>
the stern was foremost. This was the culminating point <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the passage.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">rain </span>without losing his presence of mind for an instant, guided the<br/>
helm with his foot, while he assisted the rowers with his <span style="color: #0000FF;">arms </span>turned<br/>
the boat round <span style="color: #0000FF;">once </span>more, brought it into the right channel, and finally<br/>
into the less rapid part of the Nile, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assets</span>. The entire <span style="color: #0000FF;">passage<br/>
</span>lasted <span style="color: #0000FF;">42 </span>minutes.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Faun </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Maninan </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">T0 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Puma </span>the crooked road skirts the bank of<br/>
the river. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">villageuchildren </span>pursue the traveller, begging for<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bakshish</span>. When the path, covered with <span style="color: #0000FF;">granite-dust</span>, grows narrower<br/>
and begins to lead over smooth granite, the traveller <span style="color: #0000FF;">should </span>dismount. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">curiously-shaped </span>rocks in the bed and on the bank of the<br/>
Nile <span style="color: #ff0000;">hear </span>numerous inscriptions. Some of them look as though they<br/>
had been built up out of <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span>rounded blocks. These forms<br/>
seem to have struck the ancient Egyptians most forcibly, <span style="color: #0000FF;">form </span>the<br/>
relief of the Source of the Nile at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phillis </span>(p. 294<span style="color: #ff0000;">)</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.. </span>one of the few<br/>
representations of landscape in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">river-god </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">crouches<br/>
</span>under a pile of blocks like these. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>25 <span style="color: #0000FF;">min</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>we reach a small plain<br/>
and obtain a charming view of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Platter</span>, the most beautiful spot on<br/>
the Nile, and the goal of travellers who do not wish to go on to the<br/>
second cataract. The small plain <span style="color: #0000FF;">above-mentioned</span>, to the E. of the<br/>
island, is shaded with handsome sycamore <span style="color: #0000FF;">tress</span>, near which is a<br/>
long low building of a semi-European appearance, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">battlemented<br/>
</span>roof. This is the deserted station of the Roman Catholic missionaries,<br/>
who <span style="color: #0000FF;">house </span>founded settlements in Central Africa, all of which, <span style="color: #0000FF;">how<br/>
</span>ever, including <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span>that at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khartdm</span>, have <span style="color: #ff0000;">been<br/>
</span>smooth water, presents, with its imposing temple<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">D </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p </span>graceful kiosque, and flourishing vegetation, <span style="color: #ff0000;">a<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">l </span>beautiful contrast to the rugged, bare and <span style="color: #ff0000;">precipim<br/>
<br/>
</span>W. To the N. a massive double rock, with the name<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Z </span>above the rest; to the W. rises the rocky island of<br/>
<br/>
scriptions. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">ferry-boat </span>is to be found at the<br/>
<br/>
village of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shelli </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span>. Between the <span style="color: #0000FF;">railway-station </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">811811511 </span>and the<br/>
<br/>
Nile is a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>palm-grove, with the tents of the Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">troops<br/>

board, but those who come by rail are recommended to bring their<br/>
provisions with them from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
