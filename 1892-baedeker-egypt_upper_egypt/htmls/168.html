behind the fortress of Katesh. Then they pressed forth on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">S. </span>side of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Katesh </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mum</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the centre of the legion of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Re</span>, which was on the<br/>
march, and having no warning was unprepared for the battle. The archers<br/>
and chariots gave <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>before them. His Majesty alone had made a halt<br/>
to the N. of the fortress <span style="color: #0000FF;">Katesh</span>, on the W. bank of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Grantee</span>. News<br/>
was brought to His Majesty of what had happened. And behold, the king<br/>
rose up like his <span style="color: #0000FF;">lather </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">HUM </span>(the god of war); he seized his weapons and<br/>
put on his armour, like Baal in his hour. The noble <span style="color: #0000FF;">karma </span>that bore his<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">majesty </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Victory </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lor</span>" was their name) came forth from the stable<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramses</span>, the beloved of Amman, and the king dashed in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">attack<br/>
</span>into the midst of the miserable Kheta. He was alone and no other was<br/>
with him. And as he hastened on before the eyes of those that followed<br/>
him, he found himself surrounded by <span style="color: #0000FF;">2600 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chariot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of war, (<span style="color: #0000FF;">cut </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">off</span>) from<br/>
his return by all the warriors of the miserable Kheta and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">home<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">runs </span>peoples that accompanied them; by the people of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arados</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mysis</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pisidia </span>(Aratu, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mass</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pidasa</span>). Each of their chariots bore three men,<br/>
and they had all united themselves.'No prince was with <span style="color: #0000FF;">me </span>no general,<br/>
no commander of the archers or chariots. <span style="color: #0000FF;">My </span>soldiers have deserted me,<br/>
and my knights <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>fled before them; not one of them has made a stand<br/>
to <span style="color: #0000FF;">fight </span>by my side<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Than </span>spoke his majesty:'Who art <span style="color: #0000FF;">than</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">n </span>father<br/>
Amman? does a father forget his son? Have I ever undertaken anything<br/>
without thee? Have I not walked and do I not stand <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>according to<br/>
thy words? Never have I <span style="color: #0000FF;">tres </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eased </span>thy commands<span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>What are these<br/>
Semites to thee? Amman <span style="color: #0000FF;">ten </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>the godless helpless. Have I not <span style="color: #ff0000;">altered<br/>
</span>to thee countless <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>Through me thy holy dwelling was filled<br/>
with my captives. I have built thee a temple for millions of years, and<br/>
I furnish thy <span style="color: #0000FF;">store-houses </span>with all my <span style="color: #0000FF;">goods </span>I brought the whole<br/>
world to thee to enrich thy possessions; <span style="color: #0000FF;">dim </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">oxen </span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrificed </span>to thee on<br/>
all manner of <span style="color: #0000FF;">sweet-smelling </span>wood. I have not failed to make thy <span style="color: #0000FF;">fore<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">court</span>. Stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">pylons </span>I erected for thee, and I myself erected the <span style="color: #ff0000;">flag-studs<br/>
</span>before <span style="color: #0000FF;">chum </span>caused <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisks </span>to be brought from Elephants, and it was<br/>
I who caused stones of eternal duration to be brought. For thee ships<br/>
plough the deep and bring to <span style="color: #0000FF;">then </span>the tribute of the nations<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Surely a<br/>
wretched fate awaits him who resists thy commands, but happiness will<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>to him who knows thee. I beseech thee, <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span>father Amman, look upon<br/>
me here in the midst of countless peoples who are strange to me. All<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">madam</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>have united themselves against me, and I <span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>alone and no one<br/>
is with me<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>My numerous soldiers have deserted me; no one of my<br/>
knights looked <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>upon me when I called them; none of them heard<br/>
my voice<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>But I believe that Amman is of more value to me than a<br/>
million of soldiers, than a hundred thousand knights and a hundred<br/>
thousand brothers and young sons, even were they gathered together in<br/>
one lace. The work of multitudes of men is as nothing, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Amman </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">autweig </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s </span>them all. This <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">accomplished</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>0 Amman, according to the<br/>
counsel of thy mouth, and have not exceeded thy commands. Behold,<br/>
I have aid <span style="color: #0000FF;">banal</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>to thee to <span style="color: #0000FF;">tile </span>". My <span style="color: #0000FF;">mice<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sound </span>to Hermonthis and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>came at my cry. He gave me his<br/>
hand I uttered a cry of joy, and he spoke behind me: "I hasten to thine<br/>
aid, <span style="color: #0000FF;">6 </span>Ramses, my son, <span style="color: #0000FF;">beloved </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>Amman. I am with thee" .--In the<br/>
farther course of his speech, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>says<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"Not one of them (the foe)<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">finds </span>his hand to fight<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>their hearts have vanished from their <span style="color: #0000FF;">brush </span>for<br/>
fright; their arms have become <span style="color: #ff0000;">week</span>. They are no longer able to launch<br/>
their arrows, and strength fails them to hold their spears. I thrust them<br/>
into the water, so that <span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span>fall in like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">crocodile</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>They lie prone, one<br/>
upon another, and I <span style="color: #0000FF;">spread </span>death in their midst. I will not that one<br/>
should look behind him or that another should turn himself. <span style="color: #0000FF;">He </span>who<br/>
falls there shall not rise again"<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The king of course, as the apes goes on<br/>
to narrate, completely vanquished the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deletion </span>allied against him after<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fighting </span>and after his <span style="color: #0000FF;">charioteer </span>himself had lost courage. <span style="color: #0000FF;">__</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dining</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>

is accepted; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>greets the Pharaoh returning in <span style="color: #0000FF;">triumph.<br/>
