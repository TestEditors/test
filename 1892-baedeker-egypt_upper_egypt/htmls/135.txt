<br/>
</span>lee, Augustus is constantly indicated by the accompanying <span style="color: #ff0000;">eartouchee'Autokrator </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kitret</span>'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The temple was probably built in the<br/>
unsettled times of the later <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemies</span>, and the priests were <span style="color: #0000FF;">therefore </span>left in doubt whether to <span style="color: #ff0000;">fill </span>in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cartonches </span>with the name of<br/>
Ptolemy or of Augustus.<br/>
<br/>
The representations on the walls and columns, many of which<br/>
well deserve special attention, exhibit here also the Egyptian ruler<br/>
worshipping <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather </span>or some other of the divinities revered in her<br/>
temple. They illustrate several most remarkable ceremonies, which<br/>
the king performed according to the prescribed ritual in presence of<br/>
the images of the gods in the temple. We have seen reason to believe that the sculptured decorations of all the <span style="color: #ff0000;">templewchambers<br/>
</span>were executed about the end of the period of the Ptolemies and the<br/>
beginning of the Roman empire. (The <span style="color: #0000FF;">sculptures </span>in some of the<br/>
chambers in the sunk-floor and in several of the higher secret <span style="color: #0000FF;">passages</span>, date from the reigns of Ptolemies <span style="color: #0000FF;">X</span>, XL, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">XIII </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tet </span>in<br/>
spite of that, the entire adornment on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walleis </span>arranged according<br/>
to early Egyptian patterns; so that the ceremonies here depicted<br/>
were not <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>introduced under the empire, and probably no Roman<br/>
emperor ever took part in these ceremonies in this temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather</span>.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">WIRE </span>of the temple at Denderah exhibit exclusively Early <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>Manners and Customs. What we here learn are the ceremonies<br/>
imposed by the priesthood on the early Egyptian monarch who <span style="color: #0000FF;">desired </span>to worship the goddess. Thus in a representation to the right<br/>
of the entrance the king appears twice over in the same design.<br/>
First we see him, clad in a long robe and carrying a <span style="color: #0000FF;">staff</span>, entering<br/>
the hall, preceded by the priest wearing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">panther-skin </span>and<br/>
sprinkling incense on the burning <span style="color: #0000FF;">censor</span>. Next we see him <span style="color: #0000FF;">standing </span>before the image of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather</span>, his robe laid aside; bending forward he goes through the motion of cleaving the earth with the<br/>
short <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand-plough </span>in his hand, because it was an immemorial<br/>
custom that the Egyptian king should turn the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>on the site<br/>
of a temple. (In the explanatory inscription here, as elsewhere,<br/>
this ceremony is <span style="color: #ff0000;">named'boi </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">to</span>', cleaving of the ground.) The king<br/>
also smote the first blow <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>the hammer at the laying of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">foundation-stone</span>, and shaped the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>brick for the enclosing walls,<br/>
which were usually built of unburned bricks of Nile-mud dried in<br/>
the sun. All these ceremonies performed by early Egyptian monarchs<br/>
at the foundation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>temple, are here faithfully recorded <span style="color: #ff0000;">amrding<br/>
</span>to early <span style="color: #0000FF;">models </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>both in visible shape and by explanatory inscriptions. They are also recorded in the lowest of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mar </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">row</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>on the W. and E. exterior walls of the temple. In the temple of<br/>
Home at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edfn </span>the king is represented performing similar ceremonies.<br/>
<br/>
Another picture, also referring to the founding of a temple,<br/>
appears on the immediately adjoining <span style="color: #ff0000;">well</span>. Here <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>king once<br/>
more appears before <span style="color: #0000FF;">Humor</span>, bearing in <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hand </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rebuilding-Moi<br/>
