<span>32 Route 1. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ASSI'O'T</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>From Cairo<br/>

teacher<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>once <span style="color: #0000FF;">puma </span>and watered a piece of <span style="color: #0000FF;">an </span>wood and that a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit-tree<br/>
</span>sprang up, called the'Tree of Obedience<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span>, yielding fruit for the monks.<br/>
<br/>
From very early times <span style="color: #0000FF;">[ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mint </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Was </span>considered the northernmost point<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thebaid</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The steamers and <span style="color: #ff0000;">dhahabiyehs </span>are met at <span style="color: #0000FF;">et-Hamrah </span>by donkey<br/>
boys with well-saddled donkeys and by sellers of pottery, which<br/>
can nowhere in Egypt be obtained better <span style="color: #ff0000;">than </span>here. The fine pottery<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">health</span>, especially its bottles and pipe-bowls, is justly celebrated<br/>
and forms an important article in its <span style="color: #0000FF;">export </span>trade, which also <span style="color: #ff0000;">deals<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">in</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>linen, embroidered leather goods, ostrich feathers and other products <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sfrddn</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">natron</span>, soda, and corn. It has, however, lost<br/>
part of its commercial importance since the great caravans from W.<br/>
Africa have frequented other routes <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>places. Large trains of<br/>
camels still come from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Darfdr </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kordofdn</span>, generally encamping<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bent'Adin </span>(p. 29), 19 M. to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">N.W</span>. of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assidt</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The vicinity<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assidt </span>is one of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">best-cultivated </span>districts in the valley of the<br/>
Nile, the fertile strip between the Libyan and Arabian Mts. here<br/>
attaining a width of 12 M. The province of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assifit</span>, the mudir of<br/>
which resides here, contains 234 villages with <span style="color: #ff0000;">583,596 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">inhab</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>(incl.<br/>
the cases of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khdrgch </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">mad</span>). Near the harbour are several large<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">palm-gardens</span>, in which also grow pomegranate, fig, and other fruittrees. These gardens are <span style="color: #ff0000;">lot </span>at enormous prices and produce rich<br/>
harvests of fruit.<br/>
<br/>
Those who have <span style="color: #ff0000;">21f2~3 </span>hrs. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">share </span>should not omit to ride<br/>
through the town and to the tombs on the slopes of the Libyan<br/>
limestone hills, not only for the sake of the antiquities, but to see<br/>
the busy Oriental life in the bazaars and to enjoy the view from the<br/>
graves. Candles and matches must not be forgotten. To visit <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assidt<br/>
</span>from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dhahabiyeh </span>and to ride through it takes about <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>hr. The<br/>
town lies about 3/4 M. from the river and is reached from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hat </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hour </span>by an embanked road shaded with beautiful trees. Outside<br/>
the town lie the long government buildings. The streets are full<br/>
of busy life, especially on Sundays, when the people of the neighbourhood <span style="color: #0000FF;">flock </span>into the market. Oriental wares are cheaper in the<br/>
bazaars of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assidt </span>than at Cairo, but European goods are <span style="color: #ff0000;">dearer</span>. The<br/>
better houses are of burned brick, the meaner of <span style="color: #ff0000;">sun-dried </span>Nile<br/>
bricks. The facades on the street are generally unimposing, but a<br/>
glance into one of the courts of the bigger houses will show that<br/>
the wealthy merchants of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assifit </span>are not <span style="color: #0000FF;">indifferent </span>to comfort and<br/>
display. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">main </span>street <span style="color: #0000FF;">intersecting </span>the town from E. to <span style="color: #ff0000;">W. </span>is<br/>
nearly 3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">M. </span>long.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Neoropolis </span>of Ancient Lycopolis. To reach this from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">herhour </span>we require at least <span style="color: #0000FF;">12 </span>hr. Riding through part of the town,<br/>
we diverge from the main street at the point where it bends to the<br/>
right <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>proceed to the left, through the cultivated land and across<br/>
a handsome bridge, to the foot of the Libyan hills. The dark<br/>
openings of the tombs and caves are conspicuous <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>a distance in<br/>
the abrupt sides of the mountain, below which <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ii </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">u </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">w </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Arab<br/>
