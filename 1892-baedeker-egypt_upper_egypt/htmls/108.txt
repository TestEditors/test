</span>essences were poured out in honour of the god. The framework of<br/>
each scene, the mouldings separating the lines of hieroglyphics,<br/>
and the hieroglyphic symbols themselves are all executed with inimitable care. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-walls </span>of this hall, to the right and left, and<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">walls </span>near the gates leading to the chapels, <span style="color: #ff0000;">beer </span>symbolic <span style="color: #0000FF;">re</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>presentations, like those in the first hall, of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">unrest </span>of Upper<br/>
and Lower Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>At a considerable interval, beyond the third row of columns in<br/>
the second hall, and on the same level with them, is a series of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">SEVEN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">VAULTED </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CHAMBERS </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Onarnns</span>, forming the Sanctuary of<br/>
the Memnonium. The metal doors with which they were once closed<br/>
have long since disappeared. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the piers separating the doors are<br/>
rectangular niches, which probably contained images either of the<br/>
deities to whom the chapels were dedicated or of King Seti. Each<br/>
chapel is vaulted and the vaults are profusely and beautifully decorated with stars and the name <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-ma-men </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">praenomen </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Seti </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dedicatory </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Inscriptions </span>on three of the vaults prove that Osiris must<br/>
be regarded as the chief divinity of the temple. It must be noted<br/>
that the roofs of these chapels are not vaulted in the strict <span style="color: #ff0000;">archintectural </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">signification </span>of that word; they consist rather of blocks of<br/>
stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>in a round fashion and crowned by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">key-stone </span>which is<br/>
hollowed out in the interior<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The chapels were dedicated (<span style="color: #0000FF;">beginning </span>from the left) to the king, Ptah, Harmachis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, Osiris,<br/>
Isis, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horns</span>. All the chief figures in the Osiris cycle of gods are<br/>
represented here with the exception of Seth, the antagonist of Osiris,<br/>
and his wife Nephthys. With them is associated the king who has<br/>
become Osiris (see <span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span>57). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Math</span>, who becomes <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sokaersiris </span>when<br/>
regarded <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>his relations to life beyond the grave, is of course <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented</span>. In the place of honour in the midst of the seven is <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon</span>,'who is the only one and whose years flourish among the gods',<br/>
who <span style="color: #ff0000;">is'loftier </span>in his ideas <span style="color: #ff0000;">then </span>any other god','to whose feet the<br/>
gods crawl, recognising their lord and master', who is'lord of<br/>
eternity and creator of the unending', of whom indeed the other<br/>
gods may be regarded as attributes. To the right and left of Ammon are two groups of three. To the right are Osiris, Isis, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">How<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rue</span>; to the left are Ptah the <span style="color: #0000FF;">primeval</span>, the lord of the past; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harmachis</span>, who announces the new day rising in the East, who <span style="color: #0000FF;">struggles </span>for the victory of life over death, and assures the future<br/>
triumph of good over evil<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and King Seti, the temporal incarnation<br/>
of divine power in the present, in the sphere of human <span style="color: #0000FF;">activity</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>To these gods, conceived as filling these chapels with their <span style="color: #0000FF;">presence</span>, were brought the mummies, to be sanctified for their eternal<br/>
home. The way to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>chapels was indicated on the very<br/>
threshold of the temple, where Seti L, as we have seen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">construct </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1<br/>
</span>seven doors in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pronaos</span>. Most of these, <span style="color: #0000FF;">however</span>, were closed by Ramses, probably to intensify and preserve the<br/>
secret and mysterious character of the temple. But <span style="color: #0000FF;">th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">paths </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
