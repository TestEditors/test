<span style="color: #0000FF;">constructed </span>and placed it beside the <span style="color: #0000FF;">chests </span>containing the gold. The<br/>
thieves once more came, and the one who entered <span style="color: #ff0000;">first </span>was caught in the<br/>
trap. Perceiving what had happened to him, he conjured his brother to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">em </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>his head lest he should be <span style="color: #0000FF;">recognized</span>, and so bring his accomplice<br/>
into trouble. The advice was followed, and the brother departed with<br/>
the head, <span style="color: #0000FF;">denim</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the opening behind him<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The next morning the amazed<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">king </span>discovered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">headless </span>corpse in the securely fastened <span style="color: #0000FF;">room</span>. He<br/>
resolved to <span style="color: #0000FF;">angers </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>body in public, under the care of a guard who<br/>
had orders to o serve the <span style="color: #ff0000;">pastors-by </span>very closely and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>immediately<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">anyone </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>showed signs of grief at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">mournful </span>spectacle. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">architect</span>'s widow, who had learned the occurrence, was, as a true Egyptian,<br/>
beside herself at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dishononrable </span>treatment of her son's <span style="color: #ff0000;">body</span>, and<br/>
threatened to reveal all to the king unless the surviving brother contrived<br/>
to bring the corpse to <span style="color: #0000FF;">ban </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Thus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">many </span>youth soon hit upon a <span style="color: #0000FF;">plus </span>He<br/>
loaded an ass with <span style="color: #0000FF;">wine-skins</span>, three of which he <span style="color: #ff0000;">opened </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">not </span>as he was<br/>
about to pass the soldiers guarding the headless trunk. hen the wine<br/>
began to escape, he broke into loud <span style="color: #0000FF;">lamentation </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Which </span>soon attracted<br/>
the soldiers. They hastened to catch the wine in cups, and drank it up<br/>
in spite of his pretended opposition. Finally the hypocrite appeared to<br/>
reconcile himself to his fate, and pressed the soldiers to drink until they<br/>
fell helpless in a drunken sleep. He then <span style="color: #0000FF;">shaved </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>the right side of<br/>
each man's beard, and taking possession of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">brother'a </span>body, brought<br/>
it to his mother<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The king though enraged, was now devoured with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mummy </span>to discover the author of this trick. He accordingly commanded<br/>
his daughter to <span style="color: #0000FF;">seller </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>love of anyone who consented to relate to her<br/>
his craftiest and wickedest deed. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>any of her wooers should relate the<br/>
above incident, she was to seize him and cause his arrest<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">admit<br/>
</span>thief, no whit alarmed, procured the arm of a corpse, placed it under his<br/>
cloak, and going to the princess, related his adventures with the treasure<br/>
and the soldiers. When the princess sought to seize him, he thrust the<br/>
dead arm into her hands, and escaped. The king, <span style="color: #0000FF;">astonished </span>by such<br/>
cunning <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>boldness, caused a proclamation to be made that he would<br/>
not only pardon the thief but reward him if he <span style="color: #0000FF;">revealed </span>himself. Upon<br/>
this the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architect</span>'s <span style="color: #0000FF;">one </span>presented himself.<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Rhampsinitns </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">expressed </span>his<br/>
admiration and gave the princess as wife to him as the craftiest among<br/>
men; for, said the king,'the Egyptians excel all other men in craft, and<br/>
he all the Egyptians'.<br/>
<br/>
The immense wealth of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Raining </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">W. </span>is a historical fact. We have<br/>
seen representations of it in the rooms which we have just quitted; and<br/>
this Pharoah records in the great Harris Papyrus his donations to the<br/>
temples of Egypt, donations so enormous that we are justified in describing the giver as the wealthiest prince that ever set on the throne of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pharoahs</span>.<br/>
