29. The Island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phflm</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Both the <span style="color: #ff0000;">tourist</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">steamers </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">and </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mail</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">steamers </span>allow one day for a<br/>
visit to <span style="color: #0000FF;">miles</span>. Tourists by the four-weeks steamer may visit the island<br/>
twice, and they are recommended to do so. Travellers to Nubia who are<br/>
unable to find time to visit <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae </span>on the outward journey, <span style="color: #0000FF;">should </span>not<br/>
fail to devote to it at least a few hours on the return, either on the<br/>
evening of reaching <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shelled</span>, or on the next morning, after spending the<br/>
night on board the steamer. When more than one visit is paid the traveller should come once by rail, once by land returning by boat. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Accommodation </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philm </span>can only be obtained if a <span style="color: #ff0000;">dhahabiyeh </span>happens to<br/>
be there<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The name of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila </span>is derived from the old Egyptian, in which<br/>

This name occurs thousands of times on the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">a<br/>

of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lot</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">is</span>. of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Causing </span>or of the End <span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span>, referring to the Nile-voyage<br/>
hither from the N. The Copts called it <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pilot</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Points</span>, and the<br/>
Arabs used to call it <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bites</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Now-a-days </span>none of these names are<br/>
known to the natives, who usually call the island Anus <span style="color: #ff0000;">clu- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Wogdd</span>,<br/>
after the hero of one of the tales in the Thousand and One Nights,<br/>
which has undergone considerable change in the Egyptian version<br/>
and has its scene transferred to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>boatmen relate it as follows.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Once </span>upon a time there was a<br/>
king, who had a handsome favourite named <span style="color: #0000FF;">does </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">el- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wasted</span>, and a vizier,<br/>
whose daughter was named Zahr <span style="color: #0000FF;">31- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Word</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ale</span>. Flower of the Rose. The<br/>
two young people saw and fell in love with each other, and found opportunities of meeting secretly, until they were <span style="color: #0000FF;">discovered </span>through the imprudence of the maiden's attendant. The vizier was violently enraged<br/>
and, in order to secure his daughter from the farther pursuit of the<br/>
young man, <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>her to the island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philm</span>, where <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>caused her<br/>
to be imprisoned in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>strong castle (the temple of Isis) and closely<br/>
guarded. But <span style="color: #ff0000;">does </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">el-Wogdd </span>could not forget <span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">love</span>. He <span style="color: #ff0000;">forsook </span>the<br/>
court and wandered far and wide in search of her, and in the course of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">his </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">travels </span>showed kindness to various <span style="color: #0000FF;">animal </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â» </span>in the desert and elsewhere. At last a hermit told him that he would <span style="color: #0000FF;">find </span>Zahr <span style="color: #ff0000;">oil-Ward </span>on<br/>
the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae</span>. He arrived on the bank of the river and <span style="color: #ff0000;">behold </span>the<br/>
walls of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">came</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>was unable to reach the island, for the water all<br/>
around it <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>alive with crocodiles. As he stood lamenting his fate one of<br/>
the dangerous monsters <span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>to convey him to the island on his back, out<br/>
of gratitude for the young man's previous kindness to animals. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">lever<br/>
</span>was thus able to reach the prison of his mistress, and the guards <span style="color: #0000FF;">endured<br/>
</span>him to remain on the island, as he represented himself to be a persecuted<br/>
merchant from a distant land. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bird</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>belonging <span style="color: #0000FF;">m </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Zak</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">! </span>el-Ward assured<br/>
him that she was on the island, but he could never obtain sight of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hen<br/>
</span>Meanwhile the lady also became unable longer to endure her fate. Letting<br/>
herself down from her <span style="color: #0000FF;">prison</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">window </span>by means of a rope made of her<br/>
clothes, she found a compassionate <span style="color: #ff0000;">shipomaster</span>, who conveyed her from<br/>
the island in which the lover she sought then was. Then followed another<br/>
period of search and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finally </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">meeting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>lovers. A marriage, with<br/>
the consent of the father, ends the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tale</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- The Osiris Room on <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philae<br/>
</span>(p. 295) is regarded by the Arabs as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bridal-chamber</span>. The tale in the<br/>
