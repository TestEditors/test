<span style="color: #0000FF;">Katha</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>used at the festivals; mentions the day of the chief festival<br/>
at Denderah; and concludes with the name of the temple-domains<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>that of the territory behind it in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>of Tentyris. The<br/>
representations on the walls correspond to the marginal inscriptions.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Thus </span>over the portal by which we enter is a double representation<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruler </span>of Egypt. In one case he stands before the altar of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Esther</span>, in the other before that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">his</span>, performing the ceremonies<br/>
of offering incense and libation. This he does in his capacity as<br/>
chief pontiff, as the accompanying inscription <span style="color: #ff0000;">implies</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'The </span>sun,<br/>
the son of the sun (the emperor <span style="color: #0000FF;">Augustus</span>), as priest of the incense<br/>
('lord at the seat of fragrance'), <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>incense to his mother, and<br/>
as priest of the libations, holding the vessel of libation'. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">rearwall </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Opposite </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">bears </span>several representations of the monarch <span style="color: #0000FF;">express</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ing </span>his homage in <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather</span>, who is accompanied by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home<br/>

The first <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-door</span>, to the left of the entrance to Hall <span style="color: #0000FF;">C</span>, admits<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">as</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>us to a narrow Ante-room (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pl</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">syn</span>), <span style="color: #0000FF;">named<br/>

</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Staircascwlioom</span>, in the inscriptions. At the farther <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>are four<br/>
steps, beyond which a door, opening on the right, leads into the<br/>
large <span style="color: #0000FF;">STAIRCASE </span>HALL, whence an easy stone staircase ascends<br/>
straight to the roof. This hall is in complete darkness as it is<br/>
roofed over and admits no light from the sides. Another ascent to<br/>
the roof is found on the opposite or <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>side of Hall <span style="color: #0000FF;">c</span>, reached by<br/>
a door to the right of the entrance to that room, and also by a<br/>
smaller approach from Room <span style="color: #0000FF;">ram </span>(comp. p. 90). This second<br/>
ascent is not by a straight and dark flight of steps, but by a kind<br/>
of spiral staircase, with ten rectangular <span style="color: #0000FF;">bends </span>to the right, lighted<br/>
by means of openings piercing the wall diagonally and widening<br/>
towards the interior. The representations and inscriptions in the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ante-rooms </span>to the right and left and on the walls of both staircases<br/>
refer exclusively to the entrance to the halls and the ascent of the<br/>
staircases on the Great New Year's Festival. On that occasion the<br/>
ceremonial procession of the priests with the images of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rather </span>and<br/>
her fellow-gods, after completing the circuit of the lower rooms,<br/>
ascended to the roof of the temple, in order that'the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hathor </span>might be united with the beams of her father Ra, on this noble<br/>
day, the festival day of the beginning of the year'.<br/>
<br/>
The most comprehensive idea of the festival is given by the<br/>
representations on the two walls (each about <span style="color: #0000FF;">11511 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>the<br/>
straight East Staircase, which begins from Room <span style="color: #ff0000;">rvrr</span>. The left wall<br/>
presents us with a view of the procession ascending from the lower<br/>
rooms of the temple, so that it is advisable to begin our inspection at<br/>
the top of the staircase. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">explanatory </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span>13 <span style="color: #0000FF;">lines<br/>
</span>closes with the following words:'She comes at <span style="color: #ff0000;">herbeantrfnlfestrval</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
