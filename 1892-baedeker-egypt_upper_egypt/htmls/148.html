<br/>
corresponding temple room<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Six of the twelve crypts are beneath<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">ground-level</span>, and of these two are in the first hypostyle hall E<br/>
(Nos<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it </span>and 12 in Pl. <span style="color: #0000FF;">n</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>The entrance to crypt No. 10 is in<br/>
Room <span style="color: #0000FF;">sum</span>, adjoining Hall <span style="color: #0000FF;">D</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>the remaining three subterranean<br/>
crypts (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Nest </span>1, <span style="color: #0000FF;">4</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">7</span>), the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>is only accessible by a flight of steps<br/>
descending from crypt No. 2, which lies above it and is entered by<br/>
an opening in the wall of Room <span style="color: #ff0000;">vrr</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">discomforts </span>of the climb<br/>
are compensated in this case by the sight of two crypts, the lower<br/>
one, the largest of all, consisting of 7 chambers, and the upper one<br/>
adorned with representations and inscriptions in unusually good<br/>
preservation. No<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>4, entered from Room <span style="color: #ff0000;">vm</span>, and No. 7, from<br/>
Room <span style="color: #ff0000;">arv</span>, are closed with doors, which the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">keeper </span>will open<br/>
on request. Good stone stairs lead to both, and no visitor <span style="color: #0000FF;">should<br/>
</span>fail to visit at least these two crypts. Magnesium wire or a lamp<br/>
will be found useful in <span style="color: #0000FF;">examining </span>the painted walls<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">staircase </span>leading to No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">t </span>occurs a mention of a festival celebrated on the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ith </span>Epagomene day, and within the crypt is a painting of king<br/>
Pepi, kneeling and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>a golden statue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Am</span>. All these<br/>
statues, whose dimensions are given, were probably kept in the<br/>
crypts. Still more important are the inscriptions in crypt No<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>9<br/>
(mentioned on p. 81), which is entered by a very narrow hole high<br/>
up in Room x. The calendar-dates of festivals instituted by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>Ill. (1700 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.0.j </span>are here found. Mention is also made of the<br/>
fact that the ancient plan of the temple under Cheops was <span style="color: #0000FF;">rel-dis </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">covered </span>in the reign of King Pepi (<span style="color: #0000FF;">hh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Drs</span>).<br/>
<br/>
We now ascend one of the staircases mentioned on p. 91 to<br/>
the Temple Roof. Caution must be observed on account of the holes<br/>
made in the roof to admit light and air to the rooms below. At the<br/>
S.W. angle of the roof stands a small open pavilion, supported by<br/>
12 columns, which played an important part during the solemn<br/>
procession at the festival of the new year (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">91</span>). We pass through<br/>
this pavilion in passing from the E. staircase to the W. chambers.<br/>
The W. staircase, which ascends <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>successive flights, leads past a<br/>
room in the middle story, probably used as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">workshop </span>for restoring<br/>
and repairing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">status </span>and utensils of the temple. Six chambers<br/>
on the roof, three on the W. and three on the E., the first in each<br/>
case being <span style="color: #0000FF;">unroofed</span>, were used in the worship of the slain and risen<br/>
Osiris, as curious representations indicate. The second room on<br/>
the E. side formerly contained the famous Zodiac of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Denderah</span>, now<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bibliotheque </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nationals </span>at Paris.<br/>
<br/>
Finally a walk round the outside of the temple will be found<br/>
interesting. The Inscriptions, so frequently referred to above, which<br/>
contain the names and dimensions of the various apartments of the<br/>
temple, were laid bare by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Prof. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Diirnichen </span>in 1876, and after being<br/>
copied were again covered up. The projecting lions' heads on the<br/>
sides of the building, probably intended to carry off the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rain-water</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>should <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>noticed. At the left corner of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>is a Portrait<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">BAEDEKER</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'S </span>Upper Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">by </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">7<br/>
