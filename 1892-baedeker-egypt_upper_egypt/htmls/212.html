<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">talus</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the West Bank lay the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Necropolis </span>or City of the Dead,<br/>
connected with which were a large number of temples. These latter<br/>
are called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mammals</span>, because they were dedicated to the memory<br/>
of the lives and deeds of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">great </span>Pharaohs, and because they were<br/>
regarded as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">abode </span>of the dead monarchs, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifices </span>were<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offered </span>within them to the royal <span style="color: #0000FF;">mouse </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>to the gods, to whom<br/>
the kings owed their might. Built on the verge of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">necrepolis</span>,<br/>
they <span style="color: #0000FF;">stood </span>in close relation to the worship of the dead<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Just as<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>institutions etc. were maintained in connection with the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Serapea </span>adjoining the cemeteries of Memphis and Alexandria, so<br/>
the temples here were adjoined by various other establishments.<br/>
These included libraries, schools, dwellings for the priests, medical<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">colleges</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">embalmingwhouses</span>, stables and pastures for the sacred<br/>
animals, and lodgings for pilgrims, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>near the sacred ponds and<br/>
groves were entire streets, containing not only barracks for the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-guards </span>and dwellings for the ecclesiastical and <span style="color: #ff0000;">laycfdcials</span>,<br/>
but also shops and houses of private citizens who carried on trade<br/>
in the various articles used at burials or brought as <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>to the<br/>
deceased. The guild of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kolchytes </span>or embalmers is frequently <span style="color: #ff0000;">mtmtioned </span>(especially at a late date) as <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span>numerous and by no means<br/>
harmonious society. Public works of various kinds are mentioned<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">demotic </span>and Greek commercial contracts which have been<br/>
found here and are dated from this place. Among these a canal, a<br/>
sacred lake, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>large street, etc. are named<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">There </span>were many other<br/>
temples besides those whose mine are new traceable, and round<br/>
each were grouped houses of various kinds, so that <span style="color: #ff0000;">Strobe </span>and other<br/>
Greek writers were <span style="color: #0000FF;">justified </span>in describing Thebes as sporadically<br/>
inhabited. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">last-named</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>reliable geographer writes:<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Thebcs </span>is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>sporadically inhabited. Part of it lies in Arabia (E. bank of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tho </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Nils</span>), including the city proper, and part on the opposite bank,<br/>
where the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnonium </span>is situated'. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Strobe</span>, like all his countrymen, was especially attracted by the so-called <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colossi </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monsoon</span>,<br/>
which he considered as repaying in themselves the trouble of the<br/>
journey to Thebes.<br/>

<br/>
</span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">gigColonel </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Homers</span>, which are visible from a great <span style="color: #ff0000;">dim<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">stance</span>, are reached on <span style="color: #ff0000;">donkeyuback </span>in <span style="color: #ff0000;">20.25 </span>min. after crossing<br/>
the W. arm of the Nile. The route, which leads through <span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cultivated </span>lands, cannot be mistaken, for the goal is in view all the<br/>
way. These two colossal statues have suffered <span style="color: #0000FF;">severely </span>from the<br/>
hand of time and have lost their artistic value, but they still<br/>
exert all their old attraction in virtue of the innumerable associations that cling to them. They are surpassed in size and in beauty<br/>
of material only by the shattered colossus in the Ramesseum. The<br/>
two immense figures and the cubical thrones on <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">they </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">re<br/>
