<br/>
</span>Those who are interested in Christian antiquities should follow<br/>
the E. bank from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shehh'Abhdeh </span>towards the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Si </span>In about 3/4 hr.,<br/>
after passing some ruins of a late epoch, we reach the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ber </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Abu<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Bennie </span>(Convent of St. John), called also simply <span style="color: #ff0000;">cal-Dir</span>. In the<br/>
days of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mameluke </span>persecutions the Christians are said to have<br/>
lived here and at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shélrh </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Abideh </span>in comparative security, as the<br/>
Arabs believed that no Mohammedan could exist here on account<br/>
of the evil spirits. At present there are more fellahin here than<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gopts</span>. There is little to be seen at <span style="color: #ff0000;">cd-str</span>. The crypt, in which<br/>
divine service is <span style="color: #0000FF;">hold</span>, is said to date from the time of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">EmPress </span>Helena. By ascending the hill at the back of the houses, we<br/>
reach, to the left of the ravine, some <span style="color: #0000FF;">cave-like </span>quarries, which<br/>
were fitted up as Christian chapels and were embellished at an early<br/>
date with sculptures. The main chamber contains paintings of saints<br/>
and scenes from the New Testament, but those in one of the side<br/>
chapels (Raising of Lazarus, Wedding at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gena</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">eta</span>) are better.<br/>
To judge from their style these interesting pictures are not earlier<br/>
than the 6th cent. <span style="color: #0000FF;">All</span>. Among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Septic </span>monks who resided here<br/>
(from the 4th cent. onwards) were Victor and his brother <span style="color: #ff0000;">Koluthus</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Silvanus</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Macarius</span>; and the tombs of the last two-are still<br/>
shown. The adjoining quarry was begun by Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill.<br/>
<br/>
</span>About 3/4 hr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">beyond </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Dér </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Aba </span>Hennis we reach <span style="color: #ff0000;">Der </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oh</span>,<br/>
the'convent of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dates-palms</span>'. To reach the <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tomb </span>with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">repvcscntotion </span>of the transportation of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Colossus, we cross the dry<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">water-course </span>beyond the houses, ascend the hill on the left side,<br/>
and near the top reach a path on which, a little to the right, the<br/>
grave is situated. Guides may be procured for a few paras. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Travellers </span>descending the river should visit the tomb from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beulah</span>,<br/>
above which towers the rocky <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gcbct </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Shaikh </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sa'id </span>(with a shekh's<br/>
tomb), in which the tomb in question is <span style="color: #0000FF;">hollowed </span>out. The whole<br/>
district belonged to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">some </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Us </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">HermOpolis</span>. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">represenu<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">tation </span>in this tomb is highly interesting as being the only one that<br/>
gives us an idea of the processes used by the Egyptians in moving<br/>
their colossal statues.<br/>
<br/>
The Arabs thought it impossible that <span style="color: #ff0000;">more </span>human strength could<br/>
move such huge burdens, and hence a legend grew up among them that<br/>
the subjects of the Pharaohs were giants, who knew how to move masses<br/>
of rock with their magical <span style="color: #0000FF;">stoves</span>. Even the men of the present day, at<br/>
whose command stand forces of which the ancient Egyptians never even<br/>
dreamed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span>astounded at their achievements in this direction <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">feel<br/>
</span>inclined to solve the problem by <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascribing </span>to them the use of technical<br/>
aids, which we have no evidence that they possessed. The principles of<br/>
the pulley and the lever seem to have been unknown to them; and <span style="color: #0000FF;">obstacles</span>, which seem to us to demand imperatively the application of<br/>
<br/>
steam <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>machinery, were overcome by enormous multiplication of sheer<br/>
human power<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
