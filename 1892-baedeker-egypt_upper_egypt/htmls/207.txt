across the entire breadth of the temple and having its roof supported<br/>
by eight columns in two rows with <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-capitals</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>This was at least<br/>
adorned, if not built, by Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">XIII</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>; while the door bears the<br/>
cartouche of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nekhnebf </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-capitals </span>are comparatively low,<br/>
and their edges are bent out to a remarkable extent. Beyond this<br/>
hall are the rooms of the Sanctuary. Here, especially in the rooms<br/>
to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">E</span>, are a series of deeply carved inscriptions, some of which<br/>
are of great <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>importance though of little general interest.<br/>
Ramses IV. (<span style="color: #0000FF;">hick </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mi</span>) and Ramses XIII. occur here, and several<br/>
Ptolemaic princes have carved their names. Various Greeks, of<br/>
late date, <span style="color: #0000FF;">have </span>also left their names in longer or short inscriptions,<br/>
placed beside representations, of foot-prints (indicating that they<br/>
had visited the spot<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>as pilgrims), <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>habit illustrated also at Philae<br/>
and elsewhere (<span style="color: #0000FF;">ea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Lashes). <span style="color: #0000FF;">leis </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu </span>(besides Thoth<span style="color: #ff0000;">)<br/>

</span>were the gods to whose shrines pilgrimages were most frequently<br/>
made in search of health. It is worth noting that the temple of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu </span>contains the only representation of circumcision yet <span style="color: #0000FF;">discovered </span>in Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Not only <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>, but also the other gods of the<br/>
triad to which he belonged were worshipped in this temple; both<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Math</span>, called'the great<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>and the'mistress of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ashru</span>', <span style="color: #0000FF;">xnd </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">AmmonRa </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t'lard </span>of the throne of both worlds in <span style="color: #ff0000;">E. </span>Thebes, ruler of<br/>

which abound in wearisome profusion on the architraves and <span style="color: #0000FF;">else</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">where</span>, one, of the time of Ramses XML, will serve as an example:<br/>
'The living good god (<span style="color: #ff0000;">he</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>the Pharaoh) raised this building in the<br/>
house of his father <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>, the lord of Thebes, and built this temple<br/>
of good limestone and sandstone in workmanship for long duration'.<br/>

V. The Small Temple of Apet.<br/>
<br/>
The Temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Apct </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span>. W), once occupied by Champollion as<br/>
a dwelling, lies close to the W. <span style="color: #0000FF;">wall </span>of the temple of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>. It<br/>
is <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>used as a depository for the smaller monuments found at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Karnak</span>, the best of which are periodically transferred to the Egyptian museum at Gizeh. Diab <span style="color: #0000FF;">Timmy</span>, who lives opposite (a boy<br/>
will summon him), opens the temple on request. Among less <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>objects a beautifully executed torso of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span>m. <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
