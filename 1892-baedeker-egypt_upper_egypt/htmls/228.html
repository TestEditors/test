There are in all 23 princes, of whom only the thirteenth need still be<br/>
mentioned. After the death of 12 brothers he <span style="color: #0000FF;">ascended </span>the throne<br/>
at a ripe age. As we may gather from the list to the left, this is<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Mercnptoh</span>, frequently though inaccurately named the Pharaoh of the<br/>
Exodus, whose name as king was afterwards added in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">cartouohe<br/>
</span>above him<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>similar honour naturally could not <span style="color: #ff0000;">fail </span>to any of the<br/>
other princes. 0n the columns appears Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">oderingsacriflces<br/>

conspicuous among whom are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman </span>in his various forms, Seth,<br/>
Thoth, Isis, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ME</span>, Nut, Sekhet, etc.<br/>
<br/>
The Second Smaller <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colonnaded </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Ballon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>D), with four couple<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">papyrus-bud </span>columns, is remarkable for two features. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>is the roof richly decorated with astronomical representations, proving that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum </span>was a monument dedicated to the worship<br/>
of the dead. The second is a representation on the N. part of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">rear-wall </span>(the S. part is <span style="color: #0000FF;">ruined</span>), which seems to support the <span style="color: #0000FF;">state-a<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ment </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span>that a sacred library was deposited in the tomb<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Osymandyas</span>, with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">legend'HoSpital </span>for the soul' <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wort </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">}</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inmates</span>). The Pharaoh, with all the royal attributes, sits upon his<br/>
throne. At his side rises the leafy <span style="color: #0000FF;">persea-tree</span>, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">heart-shaped<br/>
</span>fruit, upon which the king's name is being written by three deities,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">via</span>. to the left Tum on a lofty throne, to the right the goddess of<br/>
history, and behind her <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thoth-mrmes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Behind </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tum </span>are the words:<br/>
'Address of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-Tum</span>, lord of the great hall <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">HeliOpolis</span>), in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum </span>to his son Ramses, the beloved of Ammon<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Up, for<br/>
the distinguishing of thy name to all eternity, that it may <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">preserved </span>on the sacred <span style="color: #0000FF;">persea-tree</span>'. In this hall also, on either side<br/>
of the door, is a procession with the sacred boats of'Muth, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsu</span>,<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">deified </span>king, and his consort.<br/>
<br/>
The following Room (<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>E) is much injured, though four <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns </span>are still standing. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">conning </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">line</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings</span>, and a few not<br/>
uninteresting sculptures (<span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>on the door-pillars), which seem<br/>
still farther to support the belief that we are now in the rooms of a<br/>
Library. The figures of the Theban triad are <span style="color: #0000FF;">notunusual</span>; <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>the forms<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Safehh</span>, mistress of libraries, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Thoth-mrmes</span>, the celestial<br/>
scribe (both facing the room we have now entered) are noticeable.<br/>
The god is accompanied by a form representing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">personified </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sense<br/>
</span>of sight, with an eye as his symbol; the goddess by the personified<br/>
sense of hearing, with an ear above his head<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Thoth writes down<br/>
the resolutions <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>thoughts of the god, while <span style="color: #ff0000;">Safekh</span>, the goddess<br/>
of history, causes the fame of the great deeds of the past to ring in<br/>
the ears of posterity. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">dedicatory </span>inscription states that this<br/>
door was overlaid with <span style="color: #0000FF;">silver-gilt </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">electrum</span>), and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Champoliion<br/>
</span>found that the very low relief was formerly covered with a cloth<br/>
coated with stucco, and was then probably gilded. <span style="color: #0000FF;">No </span>traces <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">gliding </span>is new to <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">found</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- The <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-rooms </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Adjoining </span>this W<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
