The king barred the mouth of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">File </span>as with a wall with well-manned<br/>

The granite gateway of the second pylon admits to the Colonnaded<br/>

period and destroyed after the spread of Islam in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Upperngypt</span>.<br/>
This second court is a specially retired enclosure, in which the<br/>
slightly projecting concave cornice, running round the entire open<br/>
