campaigns, which we have already met with on the pylon at Luxor<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span>112) and which will be mentioned again when we visit the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramesseum </span>(p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">161</span>), occurs also here in long but not easily <span style="color: #0000FF;">accessible </span>lines of <span style="color: #0000FF;">hieroglyphics</span>. About 40 ft. to the right (E) of the<br/>
door through which we quitted the hypostyle, a short wall projects<br/>
at right angles from the wall of the great temple, bearing a most<br/>
interesting <span style="color: #0000FF;">anti </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">important </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">inscription</span>, containing the Treaty of Peace<br/>
destined to put an end to the wars between the Egyptians and the<br/>
<br/>
Asiatics.<br/>
<br/>
This is the most ancient international treaty extent in the world, and it is<br/>
as remarkable for its contents as for its form, which is so conceived in the<br/>
essential points that modern documents of a similar aim <span style="color: #0000FF;">differ </span>from it<br/>
only in the greater <span style="color: #0000FF;">conciseness </span>of their expressions. The bottom of the<br/>
inscription is at resent concealed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">rubbish </span>The treaty is dated the<br/>
21st <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tybi </span>in the let year of King Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">ll</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Miamnn</span>, in the town of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Tania</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as</span>. the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ramsestown</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Kheta </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">prince </span>caused the treaty to be<br/>
engraved on a silver table and sent an ambassador to seek peace. The<br/>
document proper, divided into paragraphs and translated by the eminent<br/>
French Egyptologist <span style="color: #ff0000;">F</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Chabas, begins as follows:'Formerly and for a<br/>
long period the mighty king of Egypt and the prince of the Kheta lived<br/>
in good understanding (God grant that hostility never again exist between<br/>
them). Nevertheless he declared war against the great king (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sen </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1</span>.) of<br/>
Egypt, in the time <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mamnun </span>my brother, prince of the Kheta. But<br/>
from <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>and from this <span style="color: #ff0000;">iuy </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Khamsnn </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">princa </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Kheta, makes a<br/>
treaty in order to arrive at <span style="color: #0000FF;">o </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Mating </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">understanding </span>May Ra, may Seth<br/>
lend them endurance, as well for Egypt as for the land of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Km</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Aramaea</span>), so that hostility may never again arise between them<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>The<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">following </span>points were agreed upon: <span style="color: #0000FF;">linemen</span>, prince of the Kheta, unites<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">llamas </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Miamun </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">um </span>mighty king of Egypt, to cause to exist between<br/>
them good peace and good alliance from this day onwards forever. He<br/>
shall be allied with me, he shall be at peace with me; and I, I shall be<br/>
allied with him, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span>, I shall <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>at peace with him forever<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. After a<br/>
brief historical retrospect, the treaty goes on:'The prince of the Kheta<br/>
will never again invade Egypt to carry <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>anything whatever out of it,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">names </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mmun</span>, the mighty king of Egypt, will never invade the<br/>
land of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Knew</span>, to carry <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>anything whatever out of it<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Then, after<br/>
another historical retrospect:'When enemies turn against the land of<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">bliamun</span>, the mighty king of Egypt, he will send to the prince of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>the message<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Tome </span>and unite <span style="color: #0000FF;">myself </span>with my might against<br/>
them". The prince of the Kheta will <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>at the disposal of the king of Egypt<br/>
and will smite his enemies. If the prince of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khota </span>does not take the<br/>
field in person, he will send his <span style="color: #ff0000;">foetusoldiers </span>and war chariots to smite<br/>
the enemies of the king of Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">...</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and vice <span style="color: #0000FF;">verse </span>(with repetition<br/>
of the above paragraph<span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Than </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">runom </span>a remarkable convention by<br/>
which the parties to the treaty bind themselves not to use force in preventing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">mixed </span>workmen from passing from one country into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">omen </span>The gods<br/>

to punish the breaker of the treaty; while to him who keeps it they shall<br/>
grant life, to him and to his house, his estate, and his servants. Next<br/>
follow two remarkable articles in which the contracting parties bind<br/>
themselves mutually to extradite criminals; though, by a condition which<br/>
speaks highly for the civilization reached by both nations, his crime<br/>
'shall not be permitted to raise itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>against the extradited criminal, <span style="color: #0000FF;">as</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
