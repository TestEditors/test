<br/>
well as from the W., and even for those advancing through the<br/>
series of pylons on the S. <span style="color: #0000FF;">-it </span>is improbable that Cambyses caused<br/>
the destruction of this'heart' of the worship of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">if </span>we may<br/>
use that expression, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nectanebus</span>, who was a mighty builder<br/>
would certainly have restored it, had it been injured. On the other<br/>
hand, nothing is more likely than that one of the later Persian<br/>
kings selected this temple for destruction after some abortive <span style="color: #0000FF;">insurrection </span>on the part of the Egyptians, in order to punish the <span style="color: #0000FF;">rebellious </span>province in its most sensitive part. Ptolemy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sonar</span>, who<br/>
held the reins for Philip <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aridaeus</span>, could have found no easier way<br/>
to win the hearts of his new subjects than to restore the holy places<br/>
destroyed by the Persians; while to do so was to imitate <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexander </span>the Great. In this particular case the work was not <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult</span>,<br/>
for though <span style="color: #ff0000;">now </span>sculptures had to <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>provided for the adytum, its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">want</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>were for the most part still <span style="color: #0000FF;">standing </span>In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dedicationinscription </span>in the interior of the sanctuary, Philip records merely<br/>
that he had restored with granite the sanctuary which was falling<br/>
to ruin,'which was built in the time of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">UL </span>king of<br/>
Upper and Lower Egypt'; and a fragment of the older structure,<br/>
bearing on its upper side a representation of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tutmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>gifts<br/>
to Amman Generator, was used as <span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ceiling-slab </span>in the restoration.<br/>
<br/>
The inscriptions and carvings on the Inner Walls of the first<br/>
chamber are neither imposing nor specially interesting. They still<br/>
exhibit traces of colour, especially of the blue pigment, which was<br/>
lavishly used to make the figures stand out more distinctly from<br/>
the reddish stone. Amman in both his main characters (Amman<br/>
Generator and Amman king of the gods) receives the homage of<br/>
Philip, or rather of the representative of the royal house of Macedon,<br/>
for it is certain that Philip never entered the valley of the Nile. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Math<br/>
</span>of course also appears with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammo</span>, and once is depicted as<br/>
embracing him, an absolutely unique representation. The traveller<br/>
will see with surprise in this sacred spot a representation of the<br/>
king, under the auspices of Khnum, catching birds with a net, and<br/>
promising to bestow his booty upon Amman.<br/>
<br/>
The Exterior Walls of the holy of holies are covered with numerous low <span style="color: #ff0000;">reli </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sis </span>and inscriptions, not easily seen on account of the<br/>
smoothness and polish of the granite. On the right side (<span style="color: #ff0000;">8</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>) the<br/>
Pharaoh is in one place sprinkled with the water of life by Her Hut<br/>
(Vol<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, p. 133) and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Thoth</span>, and in another receives from them the<br/>
royal crown. Elsewhere we see the boat of Ammon being brought<br/>
in solemn procession to the sanctuary, and the king offering four<br/>
calves of <span style="color: #0000FF;">different </span>colours (perhaps symbolizing the nations of the<br/>
four quarters of the globe, over which he watched as shepherd of<br/>
the people). The inscription records that <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman-site</span>, the bull (<span style="color: #0000FF;">husk<br/>
</span>band) of his mother, is highly pleased with the beautiful monument<br/>
which Philip has <span style="color: #0000FF;">erected </span>to him, and that he promises all kinds of<br/>
