<br/>
whose name also occurs with Aahmes', <span style="color: #ff0000;">Binpu</span>, and a king <span style="color: #0000FF;">Season<br/>
</span>on the pedestal of a statuette of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Harpocrates</span>, now in the museum<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Giseh</span>. Those, with the exception, of course, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amines</span>, were<br/>
probably provincial or local kings. Above some ships in the left<br/>
part of the tomb a festival of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill. </span>is mentioned, probably a<br/>
later addition. According to Maspero this tomb dates from the<br/>
20th Dynasty.<br/>
<br/>
Farther to the left lies the tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">defiance</span>, Chief of the Sailors,<br/>
the son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">More </span>and her husband <span style="color: #0000FF;">Babe</span>, who was the maternal<br/>
grandfather of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pihari</span>. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Funereal </span>Inscription is <span style="color: #ff0000;">served </span>in the<br/>
rock instead of being painted on stucco, a fact which lends great<br/>
importance to this tomb.<br/>
<br/>
The inscription covers nearly the whole wall to the right, as we<br/>
enter, <span style="color: #0000FF;">aiming </span>it with the figure of the deceased. Aahmes appears with<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">dips </span>his wife, seated in a chair beneath which cowers a pet monkey;<br/>
before them stand their daughter's son <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pihari</span>, who caused this tomb to<br/>
he adorned for his gallant grandfather<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Beneath is another <span style="color: #0000FF;">Pillar</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>to his father Harari and his wife, and beneath him again are<br/>
three sons, including yet <span style="color: #0000FF;">another </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Khan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Beside the door to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sidechamber </span>is another dedication to Aahmes, the chief of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sailors</span>, from<br/>
his grandson <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pihari </span>(p. 239), to keep his memory green in this spot. The<br/>
biography of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aahmes </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thus </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">begins</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'Aahmes </span>(Amasis), commander of the<br/>
sailors, son of the late <span style="color: #ff0000;">Alina</span>, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">can</span>: I speak to you, all ye people. Learn<br/>
the marks of honour which <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>to my share; for I was distinguished<br/>
seven times with the golden necklace, in the presence of the whole country<span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>Male and female slaves were my own (the names of the slaves<br/>
presented to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Aahmes </span>are inscribed on the outside of the tomb), and I<br/>
received many <span style="color: #0000FF;">fields</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The name of a great hero which he (the speaker)<br/>
won for himself, will nevermore be obscured in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">land</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>He speaks:<br/>
I was born in the town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hehent </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">Eileithyiar</span>, my father was a colonel<br/>
under the late king <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rasekenen </span>(Vol. 1., p. 9), and was named Babe, son<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Roam</span>; then <span style="color: #0000FF;">1 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sawed </span>in his stead as captain on board the ship'The<br/>

and unmarried and slept on the couch of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rheunu </span>(perhaps those <span style="color: #0000FF;">ex.eluded </span>from the dwelling of the married, <span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>. bachelors). But after <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">had<br/>
</span>founded a household (taken a wife), I <span style="color: #0000FF;">meek </span>myself to fight in the N.<br/>
fleet. Then I followed the king on foot, when he mounted his <span style="color: #ff0000;">warchariot</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>When the fortress of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ha-war </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Altoids</span>, a stronghold of the Hyksos,<br/>
Vol. <span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>, p. 89) was besieged, I had to fight on <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot </span>before the king. Then<br/>
I was appointed to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ship'Kha </span>em <span style="color: #0000FF;">hennefer</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Ascent </span>in Memphis); we<br/>
fought in the arm of the river at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abel-is </span>and I acquired booty and won<br/>

king, and I received the golden necklace for velour. Another contest took<br/>
place on the same spot and <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>was again awarded the golden necklace <span style="color: #0000FF;">for<br/>
</span>valour'<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Aahmes was decorated a third time at Takemi, to the S. of the<br/>
fortress.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Abaris </span>was taken and I captured there in <span style="color: #ff0000;">all </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">4 </span>persons, amen<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">3 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">women</span>; His <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bf'esty </span>assigned them to me as slaves'. <span style="color: #ff0000;">~</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>The next<br/>
