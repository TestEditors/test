HEIGHTS above the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea-level </span>and other measurements are<br/>

Though nearly every page of the Handbook has been<br/>
compiled from personal observation and experience, and<br/>
although the conservative East is not nearly so liable to<br/>
changes as the more progressive West, the Editor makes no<br/>
claim to absolute accuracy in every detail; and he will feel<br/>
indebted to any traveller who, from personal experience,<br/>
may be able to indicate errors or omissions in the Handbook.<br/>
The same remark applies equally to the PRICES and various<br/>
items of expenditure mentioned in the volume. The expense<br/>
of a tour is much more directly <span style="color: #0000FF;">affected </span>by the circumstances<br/>
of the moment and the individuality of the traveller in the<br/>
East than in <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">i</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>though it may here be added that the<br/>
arrangements of <span style="color: #0000FF;">com</span>. Cook and Gaze (pp<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">xw</span>, xv), of<br/>
which most visitors to Upper Egypt will avail themselves,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offer </span>a comparative immunity against extortion<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A carefully<br/>
drawn up contract will similarly protect those who prefer to<br/>
