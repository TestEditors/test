<br/>
became known that the N. colossus emitted a musical note at sunrise, a<br/>
new and beautiful myth arose among the Greeks who were always ready<br/>
to invent a legend in order to explain a fact. The hero of this myth was<br/>
a <span style="color: #ff0000;">Riemann</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>hailing from Ethiopia, who fell at Troy. Appearing as a stone<br/>
image at Thebes, <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>greeted his mother <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ems </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>a sweet and plaintive<br/>
note when she appeared at dawn. The goddess heard the sound, and the<br/>
morning dews are the tears which she shed upon her <span style="color: #0000FF;">beloved </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">child</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">enormous </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">size </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">colossi </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the legends that clustered round<br/>
them, rendered them so attractive to the Greeks and Romans<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>that Tacitus<br/>
mentions them among the chief marvels (<span style="color: #ff0000;">proscipoa </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mirocnla</span>) of Egypt;<br/>
and under the Roman empire travellers to the Nile considered that the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">object </span>of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey </span>was attained when they had seen the pyramids<br/>
and heard the musical note of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Memnon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>Northern Colossus is the famous Vocal <span style="color: #ff0000;">Statue </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Eamon</span>.<br/>
This is distinctly indicated by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">effusions </span>of early tourists,<br/>
varying both in length and excellence, which are inscribed on the<br/>
legs. The statue is composed of two parts. The lower and older<br/>
part consists of a single block of <span style="color: #ff0000;">sandstonemconglomerate</span>, and<br/>
reaches to the middle of the arm resting on the knee and, behind,<br/>
to above the girdle. The upper part was broken <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span>by an earthquake in the year <span style="color: #ff0000;">2</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">? </span>B.C., and was not restored until the reign of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Septimius </span>Severus, many years later<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The restoration was not very<br/>
happily managed, for instead of being made out of a single block,<br/>
the body and head were built up of thirteen blocks of common<br/>
sandstone in <span style="color: #0000FF;">fire </span>courses. The care with which the lower part (now<br/>
much injured) was executed <span style="color: #0000FF;">Offers </span>a great contrast to the crudeness<br/>
of this newer part. To the right and left <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>between the legs stand<br/>
female statues leaning against the throne, representing the mother<br/>
and wife of Amenhotep <span style="color: #0000FF;">111.</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mot </span>em <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Til</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>On each side of<br/>
the seat two <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile-gods </span>were represented in sunk relief, holding<br/>
papyrus plants wound round the symbol of the union of Upper and<br/>
<br/>
Lower <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e </span>The inscriptions on the S. colossus enable us to<br/>
<br/>
supply what is here broken <span style="color: #0000FF;">oft</span>; but these, and the hieroglyphics on<br/>
the back of the statue, contain nothing beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">high-sounding<br/>
</span>titles of Amenhotep <span style="color: #ff0000;">1H</span>. and the information that <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>erected these<br/>
palatial buildings and colossal statues of sandstone in honour of<br/>
his father <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amman</span>. The king, whom we have elsewhere found <span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Â»<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">titrmstl </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a3 </span>a great <span style="color: #ff0000;">warriorwprince</span>, is also named a destroyer of <span style="color: #0000FF;">form<br/>

and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beloved </span>of Ammon<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>After the breaking of the colossus by the earthquake of 27 <span style="color: #0000FF;">3.0</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">;</span>,<br/>
attention began to be directed to the musical phenomenon connected<br/>
with it<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Strabo says:<span style="color: #0000FF;">'Of </span>two gigantic monolithic statues situated<br/>
close to each other, one is entire, while the upper portions of the<br/>
other, from the waist upwards, are said to have been thrown down<br/>
by an earthquake. It is popularly believed that a sound, as though<br/>
caused by a gentle blow, is heard once a day proceeding from the<br/>
remaining portion on the throne and pedestal. I myself, when I<br/>
was on the spot <span style="color: #0000FF;">along </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dollar </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Galina </span>and numerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">other </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fri </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">eds<br/>
