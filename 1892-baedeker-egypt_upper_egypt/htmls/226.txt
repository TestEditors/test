idea was indicated merely by lightly carved <span style="color: #0000FF;">root-leaves </span>on the lower<br/>
part of the shafts. Beyond this <span style="color: #ff0000;">colonuade </span>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">*Hypostyle </span>Hall<br/>
(Pl<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>0), which can hardly, however, be identified with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">odeumw<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">shaped </span>hall mentioned by Diodorus in his description of the tomb<br/>
of Osymandyas (p. 159). The inscriptions call it the'Hall of the<br/>
Appearance <span style="color: #0000FF;">{ </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">comp </span>p. 85). <span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodorus </span>describes his hall as <span style="color: #0000FF;">square<br/>
</span>whereas the one before us is 98 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft. </span>deep and <span style="color: #0000FF;">196 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>broad. The<br/>
three Entrances mentioned by Diodorus still exist, and are framed<br/>
with <span style="color: #0000FF;">sculptured </span>blocks of granite. The artistic forms displayed in<br/>
this <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span>are so extraordinarily <span style="color: #0000FF;">congruous </span>with each other, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">dimensions </span>so <span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully </span>calculated, and the proportions so harmonious,<br/>
that we do not hesitate to describe it as the most beautiful hall <span style="color: #0000FF;">extant </span>in any Egyptian temple. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>its arrangement it resembled the<br/>
great colonnaded hall at Karnak. In the centre a passage was<br/>
marked out by six couples of higher columns with <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-capitals</span>,<br/>
on each side of which were three rows of lower papyrus-bud <span style="color: #0000FF;">columns</span>. Upon the latter a wall rose as high as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">calyx-columns</span>,<br/>
with which it shared the weight of the roof, while a subdued but<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>light was <span style="color: #0000FF;">admitted </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span>through openings<br/>
in this <span style="color: #0000FF;">wail </span>On the outside of the still standing S.E. wall of this<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hypostyle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hall </span>appears the kneeling king doing Homage to Amman,<br/>
Math, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Khunsn</span>, farther to the left Thoth writing the <span style="color: #0000FF;">earn<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">touche </span>of the king, and to the extreme left the king between Mentu<br/>
and Tum. Beneath is a procession of the sons of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span>, only<br/>
some of whom, with their names, have been preserved. They are<br/>
found in better preservation to the right and left of the door in the<br/>
W. wall of the hall. Diodorus mentions that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">odeum </span>contained<br/>
numerous wooden statues, representing persons before a tribunal<br/>
and gazing upon the judges<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Beliefs of judges, 30 in number, are<br/>
said to have been seen on one of the walls (but this has possibly<br/>
arisen from a confusion with the sons of Ramses). In the midst<br/>
of the judges appeared a presiding judge, from whose neck hung<br/>
the image of truth with closed eyes, and by whose side lay numerous<br/>
books. These statues were said to intimate by their attitudes (<span style="color: #0000FF;">did<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rob </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">orbiter-cc</span>) that the judges might accept <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>gifts and that the<br/>
president could look only to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">truth</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>That statues actually<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">did </span>stand in this hall is indicated by pedestals found between the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>second columns in the central row. It is also by no means<br/>
impossible that a <span style="color: #0000FF;">trial-scene </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span>like the Judgment of the Dead at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dh<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ei-Medina</span>, p. 189) may have occupied the wall of one of the adjoining chambers; and it is easily conceivable that the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hypostyle </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the<br/>
Ramesseum, with which a library and a famous school of scribes<br/>
were connected, may have been used as a court by the supreme<br/>
college of <span style="color: #0000FF;">3115<br/>
</span>The representations which have remained are concerned with<br/>
other subjects, while the fine inscription on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SE</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall </span>returns<br/>
to the war with the Kheta. The relief <span style="color: #ff0000;">accompangivingghe </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lattpr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">is<br/>
