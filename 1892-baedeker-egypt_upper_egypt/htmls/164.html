Seth was obliterated at various epochs. The introduction of Christianity and the edicts of Theodosius were followed by the destruction of many pagan statues and the obliteration of many pagan inscriptions. At all events the new religion and the closing of the<br/>
temples dedicated to the ancient gods removed all possibility of<br/>
anything being done to preserve the monuments of the Pharaohs.<br/>
The Nile, which annually overflowed as far as the temple of Karnak<br/>
in particular, and the saline exudations of the soil, wrought harm;<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">jackals </span>and other animals sought shelter in the subterranean chambers; many tombs, at first occupied by Christian hermits, were <span style="color: #0000FF;">converted </span>into peasants' dwellings; Christian churches were erected in<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">temple</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">halls</span>, and houses were built between the columns of the<br/>
temple at Luxor. Carefully hewn blocks and slabs were removed<br/>
from the monuments, which were used as quarries, and many<br/>
limestone details were thrown into the furnace and reduced to<br/>
lime. Whither the enormous population of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hundred</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">gated</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Thebes <span style="color: #ff0000;">betooh </span>itself is unknown. A few <span style="color: #ff0000;">widelyuscattered </span>villages<br/>
alone now represent of the giant city. These have given names to<br/>
the various edifices and tombs, whose holy names might only be<br/>
uttered with pious awe in the time of the Pharaohs. The ruins of<br/>
Thebes remained long forgotten. On <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>revival of learning classical<br/>
students recalled their fame; Pococke rediscovered, described them<br/>
and drew them; and finally the publications of the great French<br/>
Expedition revealed to astonished Europe how much of the ancient<br/>
magnificence of the Pharaohs had survived to our time. Each<br/>
succeeding <span style="color: #0000FF;">scientific </span>expedition made its longest halt here and<br/>
found here its richest rewards. The names of Champollion, Wilkinson, Lepsius, and other Egyptologists are familiar words on the<br/>
site of ancient Thebes; and Mariette, who carried on excavations<br/>
under <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">auspices </span>of the Khedive, must also be mentioned<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>

temple in which part of the village of Luxor was built, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>which<br/>
is adjoined by another part. The mosque still stands within the<br/>
temple. The house of the British consul, as well as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sewoalled<br/>
