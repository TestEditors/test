<br/>
</span>including some of the Ptolemies, placed inscriptions with their<br/>
names on the ancient buildings. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">PRINCIPAL </span>PYLON is easily<br/>
recognized by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">obelisk</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and colossi at its portal. The visitor who<br/>
places himself in front of this perceives at once that rubbish <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>earth conceal <span style="color: #0000FF;">one-half </span>of the sloping facade which is richly adorned<br/>
with carvings <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>inscriptions <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>sadly damaged<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Like all pylons,<br/>
the one before us consists of two truncated pyramids with an <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance-door </span>between them. The latter was 55 ft. in height. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-u<br/>
</span>towers, which rose about 20 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>higher, were crowned with an <span style="color: #0000FF;">elegant </span>concave cornice, which has now almost completely disappeared,<br/>
and were framed with the astragal. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">entrance</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">door </span>is completely ruined. Under the cornice is a conspicuous Inscription in<br/>
large letters, which may be traced also on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">architrave </span>of the<br/>
peristyle court, wherever it has remained visible and entire. This<br/>
inscription contains a dedication, intimating that Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">H. </span>built<br/>
this imposing <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifice </span>for his father <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ammon-Ra</span>, the king of the<br/>
Gods. On each side of the entrance were two monolithic Colossi,<br/>
40 ft. in height; the most easterly has disappeared, the three<br/>
others are half-buried in rubbish. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>front of the central figures,<br/>
though not quite symmetrically placed, rose two <span style="color: #0000FF;">Obelisk</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>of pink<br/>
granite, one of which (the W.) <span style="color: #0000FF;">now </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">adams </span>the Place de la <span style="color: #0000FF;">Concorde </span>at Paris. It is to be hoped that a crack, which has <span style="color: #0000FF;">been<br/>
</span>noticed in the monument from the days of antiquity, will not lead<br/>
to its destruction under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">influence </span>of a northern climate. This<br/>
W. obelisk was smaller than its E. neighbour which is still <span style="color: #0000FF;">stand</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>ing; and the ancient architects <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to counteract <span style="color: #0000FF;">this </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">low<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">equality </span>by giving the smaller obelisk a higher base than the other,<br/>
and placing it a little farther forward. The inscriptions on the<br/>
obelisk still standing at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Luster </span>are clearly and finely cut in the stone<br/>
and are perfectly legible<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>They name Ramses the Pharaoh, with<br/>
many pretentious titles, as the founder of this gorgeous building<br/>
erected in honour of Ammon in southern Thebes (Apt res). The<br/>
faces of these obelisks, like those of most others, are slightly convex, as the priestly architects observed that a flat surface was apt to<br/>
appear concave in a strong light. Details supplied by the French<br/>
engineers give a vivid idea of the enormous weight that had <span style="color: #0000FF;">tobe<br/>
</span>handled in the erection of an obelisk, although the Paris obelisk is<br/>
comparatively small; considerably larger obelisks are to be seen at<br/>
Karnak<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The W. obelisk of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lower </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is'75 </span>ft. high, its base is 71/2 <span style="color: #ff0000;">ft.<br/>
</span>square, and its weight is upwards of 212 tons<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The exterior walls of the pylons of nearly <span style="color: #0000FF;">every </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span>temple<br/>
are adorned with representations referring to victories granted by<br/>
the gods of the sanctuaries to the royal builders. <span style="color: #ff0000;">ht </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Lusor </span>these<br/>
representations refer to victories granted by Amman to Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>The rich sculpture with which the broad walls of the pylons were<br/>
covered has <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buttered </span>severely from the hand of time. At several<br/>
places the Beliefs en crew, deeply <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stone </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">practically<br/>
