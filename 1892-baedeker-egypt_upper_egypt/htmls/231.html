<br/>
</span>second row <span style="color: #0000FF;">begin </span>with kneeling chiefs from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shah</span>, who are<br/>
followed by <span style="color: #0000FF;">white-clad </span>Ethiopians with rings of gold, <span style="color: #0000FF;">panther-names</span>,<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">giraffe</span>, and oxen. The last have unusually variegated hides, and<br/>
each has a brown and a black human hand most singularly <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>on<br/>
the points of its <span style="color: #0000FF;">home</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The inscription above this <span style="color: #0000FF;">procession </span>runs:<br/>
'the great ones of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Knob </span>(Ethiopia) speak, Hail to thee, king of<br/>
Egypt, <span style="color: #0000FF;">sun </span>of the foreign peoples. We shall breathe as <span style="color: #ff0000;">then </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">perumittest </span>and shall live according to thy pleasure'. In the third row<br/>
brown and black chiefs from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Knsh </span>bring gold and precious stones,<br/>
and semicircular fans of <span style="color: #ff0000;">ostrichmfeathers</span>, of exactly the same shape<br/>
as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flabellum </span>which <span style="color: #ff0000;">new </span>shades the pope on <span style="color: #ff0000;">certain </span>solemn<br/>
occasions and which was formerly used by the Pharaohs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">A11 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">on<br/>
</span>with artificially bent <span style="color: #0000FF;">home</span>, between which is a pond with <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish<br/>
</span>and bushes, should be noticed. The fourth and fifth divisions are<br/>
much injured. They show bright red persons (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Erythmans </span>who<br/>
dwelt between the Nile and the Red Sea), Egyptians, and very light<br/>
coloured Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">woman </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">nosegays</span>, earthen vessels, <span style="color: #0000FF;">gasoline</span>,<br/>
etc. Hui appears again on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span>. Above and beneath may<br/>
be seen the ships which brought to Egypt the choice tribute of the<br/>
south. The two richly adorned and brightly painted <span style="color: #ff0000;">dhahabiyehs<br/>
</span>(above) resemble the craft (the ornamentation of course excepted)<br/>
in which the products of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sham</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>are to this day transported to<br/>
the north. Five Ethiopian <span style="color: #0000FF;">mince</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span>kneel upon the deck of the second<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">best</span>. Cattle and other goods are being brought to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Emt </span>in the<br/>
smaller vessels below<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>wall c appears the deceased, with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">jackalwheaded </span>Anubis<br/>
on his right and Osiris <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>his left, while between him and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>are <span style="color: #0000FF;">offerings </span>to the dead. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Wall </span>a, near the door, stands the<br/>
deceased, with his domestics, singers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">610.</span>, and two richly adorned<br/>
Nile boats behind him; still farther back is the prince of Rash again,<br/>
surrounded by his <span style="color: #0000FF;">treasures</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>earthen vessels, skins of wild animals,<br/>
bright coloured boxes, <span style="color: #0000FF;">em</span>. Rings of gold are being received and<br/>
are weighed <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a treasurer named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hornofer<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0n </span>the rear wall to the right (a) appears the king (<span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span>the<br/>
corner pillar), with Hui before him<span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-~ </span>Amenhotep, another prince<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Blush</span>, is bringing pieces of <span style="color: #ff0000;">lapisu-laauli </span>on a dish. By his right<br/>
hand hangs a breast-plate, set with precious stones, like that were<br/>
by the high priest of the Jews. Behind Hui are several of those<br/>
gold and silver vessels, which at that time were manufactured by<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">thnicians </span>and Syrians with extraordinary artistic skill<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Here<br/>
also are <span style="color: #ff0000;">lapis~laznli</span>, red cornelians, and priestly <span style="color: #0000FF;">breast-plates</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">An<br/>
</span>inscription extols the Pharaoh in emphatic terms and informs us that<br/>
Syria pays this tribute. Their appearance alone is quite <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>to<br/>
enable us to decide with certainty as to the origin <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>here <span style="color: #0000FF;">represented</span>, casting themselves in the dust before the king, or standing<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>him homage and tribute. Some of them are <span style="color: #0000FF;">light</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">coloured</span>, others of a reddish hue; their <span style="color: #0000FF;">profile </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">is </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unmistakably<br/>
