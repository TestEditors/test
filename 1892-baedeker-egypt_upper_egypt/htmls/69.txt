<span>24 Route I. TELL EL-AMARNAH. From Cairo<br/>
<br/>
of them unfinished, and the colouring of the reliefs is sometimes <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
</span>wonderful preservation. The mummy shafts, in spite of their great<br/>
depth, have all long since been <span style="color: #0000FF;">despoiled </span>of their contents. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>the<br/>
very first tomb we find a representation of the king and his family<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">offering </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>to the sun's disc. The disc is encircled with<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">limes-snake </span>and furnished with several arms, stretching downwards; the hands are symbolic of energy, liberality, and the creative<br/>
faculty. Dwarfs (then, as later, a favourite royal plaything), fanbearers, and bowing courtiers stand below<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>In front is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">provostmartial </span>with his baton. To the left of the first grave, on the hill,<br/>
is the Tomb of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Panto </span>(No. 2), which is in a very ruinous condition<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Farther on to the left is that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Barnett </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">No</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>3), with a <span style="color: #0000FF;">finely<br/>
</span>worked exterior. On the <span style="color: #ff0000;">leftwall </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span>second chamber of this tomb<br/>
is a military scene, which we do not hesitate to describe as the<br/>
most realistic representation found hitherto in any Egyptian grave.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">lean </span>figure of the Pharaoh, above whom the sun spreads its<br/>
arms, stands in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">war-chariot </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">driven </span>the fiery steeds, the introduction of which Egypt owes to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyksos</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sills </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">out-runners</span>)<br/>
with long <span style="color: #0000FF;">stares </span>run in front of the chariot, towards the crowd of<br/>
people offering <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bending </span>to the ground in adoration.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Standardwbearers </span>and soldiers clear the way for the rapidly <span style="color: #ff0000;">advanw<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">sing </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">procession</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">just </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>the mounted <span style="color: #ff0000;">harasses </span>still do for the carriage<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive</span>. The king appears once more followed by his<br/>
children, who also drive their own chariots. The procession hastens towards the royal palace, which covers the right part of the rear-wall<br/>
of the chapel and also part of the right <span style="color: #ff0000;">well</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">affording </span>us a clearer<br/>
idea of an Egyptian palace than any other scene of the kind. It<br/>
has long been established that neither the royal princes nor even<br/>
the Pharaohs themselves lived in the temples. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the contrary<br/>
they used to build themselves airy <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chateaux </span>of light materials, with<br/>
doors opening on shady galleries and colonnades. Gardens with<br/>
fountains and <span style="color: #0000FF;">water-basins </span>surrounded the building, <span style="color: #0000FF;">meat </span>which<br/>
were also <span style="color: #0000FF;">out-houses</span>, stables, and well-stocked storehouses, in<br/>
quantity <span style="color: #0000FF;">corresponding </span>to the huge number of the dependents<br/>
of the royal family. The great <span style="color: #ff0000;">entrancendoor </span>is dignified with<br/>
double rows of bud columns, and red standards <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>from lofty<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flag-stem</span>. Above one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">side-doors </span>is a round window <span style="color: #ff0000;">similarto<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">those </span>which the French call <span style="color: #ff0000;">milwdewbmnf</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The palace is adjoined<br/>
by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">sepulchral </span>chapel, supported by columns and containing figures<br/>
of the king's ancestors, honoured by rich <span style="color: #ff0000;">sacrificial </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">oderings</span>; at the<br/>
door is a choir, singing pious songs of remembrance to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">accentupaniment </span>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">help</span>, and taking its time from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hand-clapping<br/>
</span>of the leader (<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>custom still preserved in Egypt<span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span>In the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first<br/>
</span>chamber of Tomb 7 (right <span style="color: #ff0000;">well</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">p. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">26</span>) is a representation of the<br/>
Temple of the Solar Disc, with a large peristyle court surrounded<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>colonnade. Pillars resembling <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caryatides </span>decorate the walls,<br/>
and above all tower the lofty pylons <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">their </span>hollow <span style="color: #0000FF;">ampules</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
