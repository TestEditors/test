building operations to construct the sanctuary of his father in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">neeropolis </span>and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">how </span>out his statue. Sacrifices and festivals are<br/>
richly provided for. The rest of the inscription assumes more and<br/>
more the character of a hymn, like those mentioned at <span style="color: #ff0000;">p. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">258 </span>and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">elsewhere</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The above will <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffice </span>to show the <span style="color: #0000FF;">filial </span>piety, with which Ramses,<br/>
at least in the earlier part of his reign, strove to complete and restore the work of his father. But the remains of the building <span style="color: #0000FF;">constructed </span>by him near the Temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Soil </span>at Abydos (p. <span style="color: #ff0000;">87</span>) prove<br/>
that he also founded a large Memnonium for himself in the district<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hypostyle </span>Halls and the Sevenfold Sanctuary.<br/>
<br/>
From the Pronaos, containing the above inscription, two doors<br/>
only now lead into the interior of the temple<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the main entrance<br/>
in the middle and a narrow door to the extreme right. The First<br/>
Hypostyle <span style="color: #0000FF;">Room </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">PI</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">0</span>), a long but narrow apartment, makes<br/>
a solemn <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>imposing impression. The roof, part of which has<br/>
fallen in, is supported by 24 columns, arranged in two rows and in<br/>
groups of four. The slender shafts are surmounted by capitals in<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>form of papyrus buds. Seti <span style="color: #ff0000;">i. </span>did not complete the plastic decoration of the room. Ramses began new sculptures instead of those<br/>
begun by his father, apparently forgetting the great filial piety he<br/>
arrogates to himself in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">above-quoted </span>inscription (p. <span style="color: #0000FF;">NO</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>Whether it was that the zeal of the son abated along with his grief<br/>
for his father, or that the priestly sculptors thought it better to celebrate a living prince rather than a dead one, the fact remains that<br/>
it is Ramses alone who is here depicted and the temple itself is<br/>
simply called the temple of Abydos, not, as in the earlier <span style="color: #0000FF;">inscriptions</span>, that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ra-ma-men </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">La </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sui </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">} </span>The sculptures preserved here<br/>
are of mediocre workmanship, and the inscriptions and <span style="color: #0000FF;">representations</span>, almost wholly dealing with Ramses and his reception of<br/>
gifts from the different gods, are generally uninteresting even for<br/>
the scholar. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>the right wall, <span style="color: #0000FF;">mat </span>the second chamber, is a series<br/>
of gods, consisting of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Re</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sins </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>giver of all delight) and his<br/>
sister Tefnut (giver of health), <span style="color: #0000FF;">Se</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>(giver of life and strength),<br/>
the great god <span style="color: #0000FF;">Apham </span>(Anubis), and Nut, who imparts the fulness of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">salvation</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>- The <span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>lists of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">names </span>of Egypt, on the lower part<br/>
of the walls, are also <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>As elsewhere, the districts are<br/>
represented as bearded male figures with the emblem of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home<br/>
