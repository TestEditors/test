discovered. She gets slight asthma in Alexandria, and is
relieved directly she reaches Cairo.

Of the two cases in which there was no improvement, one
was an English ofiicer who suffered at all times and in all
places except when he was on the sea. At Suakin and
Alexandria he was comfortable, but in Cairo he was liable to
be laid up once a fortnight, and then had to go a short
yachting cruise to get quite rid of his asthma. The second
case was a very inveterate one, for the lady had been troubled
with asthma and occasional bronchitis for more than twenty
years. At Cairo and Luxor she still had asthma every
morning, but in a modified degree. She believed that she
obtained no good from a dry climate, and like the officer,
she pined for the sea air, and stated that in England,
Brighton was the place where she had least asthma.

It is not difficult to understand that asthmatic patients
who have immunity from their attacks in damp sea air, may
obtain no relief from dry desert air, and the converse is also
apparently true.

To secure the maximum benefit from the climate of Egypt
it seems to be necessary for asthmatic people to keep in the
same temperature as much as possible, and therefore to avoid
night air. One patient, who had had chronic bronchitis and
asthma for two years, obtained great good from six months
spent in Egypt, and though in the succeeding year and a
half she has had pleurisy, she has had no more bronchitis or
asthma.

Rheumatism in an acute form is practically unknown
among the natives and Europeans in Egypt, but I have seen
two cases among young English patients. One caught cold at
Suez, and had in Cairo her second attack of rheumatic fever;
the other patient had also had a previous attack, and consequent heart-disease, and caught a chill in Cairo during
the winter. The climate is excellent for all forms of chronic
rheumatism, and for patients convalescing from acute
rheumatism contracted elsewhere. Rheumatic pains and
