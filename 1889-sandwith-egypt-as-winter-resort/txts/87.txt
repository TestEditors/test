Festivals ...---- -There are several old Egyptian and
Coptic holidays which have the advantage of being
on fixed dates, and can therefore be easily seen by
reference to guide-books. But the purely Mussulman functions take place according to the Mohammedan calendar, the year of which is Ill days
less than our own. The following dates are an
approximate guess at the principal feasts; but it
must be remembered that the actual date is often
changed either as a matter of convenience, or
to cause the chief holiday to fall upon the eve of
Friday
