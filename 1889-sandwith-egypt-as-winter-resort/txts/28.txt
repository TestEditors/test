CHAPTER II.
SUEZ CA NA L.
PORT SAID.

THE visitor is not recommended to stay in any of
the three towns on the Suez Canal, but he must
pass through one of them unless he arrives from
Europe by way of Alexandria. Port Said, with a
population of about 10,500 natives and 6000
Europeans, is an impromptu insanitary town
which originated in 1859 with the huts of the
Canal workmen. It stands on a narrow strip of
sand two hundred to three hundred yards wide,
between Lake Meuzaleh and the sea, its site
having been formed by dredgings from the harbour
thrown into the shallow lake. The surface of the
town is perfectly flat, and only about four feet
above the sea-level, and the sandy soil is permeated
by uncemented cesspools and underground reservoirs used by some of the inhabitants. It is
dependent on Cairo for a water-supply out Ismailia.
