in the surrounding earth, and consequent odour,

pipes, which are a great improvement. All cesspools are now prevented from draining into the
Nile or canals, and are obliged to be emptied at
least every six months, those of the cemented type

Abbassiyeh desert by night, at the rate of over 80,000
tons a year. There it is deodorized and sifted, and
sold to the fellaheen as "poudrette "at Â£2 a ton
for use on their lands. These changes, though not
nearly radical enough, have already contributed
