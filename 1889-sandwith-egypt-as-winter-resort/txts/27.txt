Introduction. 11

Alexandria than at Ismailia, because they may be
obliged to traverse the Suez Canal by night, and
then be put ashore uncomfortably in a boat in the
early morning. Moreover, two trains run from
Alexandria to Cairo in three and three-quarter
hours, while from Ismailia to Cairo there is only
one passenger train in the day, occupying four and
three-quarter hours. At neither port is there any
custom-house difficulty for personal baggage, and
no passport is necessary.

Proposed itinerary-Delicate patients should
leave Europe at the middle or end of October, so
as to arrive in Cairo early in November. Some
remain in Cairo all the winter; others go up the
Nile to Luxor in December or January, and return
to Cairo at the end of February. In April they
should go to Ramleh, and thence perhaps to Italy
and the south of France, arranging not to reach
England or other cold climates till the very end of
May.
