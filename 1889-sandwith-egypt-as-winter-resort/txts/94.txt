Pithon (Tel-el-Maskhuta), near the modern station
called Rameses, between Zagazig and Ismailia.
From here statues have been sent to Boulak and
the British Museum, and there are still remains
of the Nineteenth Dynasty, and of the'stove-.
chambers built by the Israelites.

2. Goshen (Saft-el-Hennah), near the railway
stations of Zagazig and Abu Hamad. A large
sculptured shrine of the Thirtieth Dynasty now in

temple, with statues of different periods from
Twelfth to Nineteenth Dynasties, and it is the
finest place for the tourist to visit till he gets
southward to Thebes. It was excavated by Mariette
and finished by Mr. Petrie, and large numbers of
papyri were sent from it to the British Museum.

4. Tel Bedowi and Nebesheh stand half-way
from Fakus to Tanis, and have furnished many
gifts to the British Museum. There are still the
temple of Aahmes of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, a
large shrine of Uati, and tombs and cemetery.

5. Zagazig (Tel Basta, or the Pibeseth of the
