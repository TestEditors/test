varying in depth, but always to be observed in
thin glass vessels. Its taste is usually considered
very agreeable, and the Arabs have a proverb that
he who once drinks it becomes enamoured of
Egypt. At the foot of the table I have made a
comparison between the average water of the year,
the average of the winter months (November 3 to
May 18 )--which is seen to be much less thick

average after filtration-and also the water of the
New River Company which supplies the north of
London and the City, and is purer than that furnished by the Thames Companies. It will be seen
that the Cairo water compares satisfactorily with
that of London.

The amount of oxygen absorbed was determined
by the French official process. The amount of
chlorine varies very considerably, and this has
already been pointed out. by Professor Wanklypfit
Who explains the variability by saying that the
storm-water of the flood sweeps over the surface of
ground long ago denuded of salt, and therefore
furnishing but little chlorine. On the other hand,
when the river has fallen, it receives water which
has passed deeper into the ground, and which has
