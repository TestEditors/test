Water-supply.--All Egyptian towns get their
drinking-water direct from the Nile, or indirectly
from the canals fed by the Nile. The Cairo Water
Company, which has a complete monopoly for

from the Nile itself, but used to be from a canal,
which during the summer months was liable to
become stagnant; it has been proposed to remove
the intake some four miles higher up the river,
above all source of contamination. The water is
pumped to the filter-beds at Abbassiyeh, whence,
after filtration, it returns to the town for consumption; all the European quarters are now supplied with filtered water, the daily average being
about 20,000 cubic metres. The velocity of the river
at high file is about five feet a second, or nearly
three and a half miles an hour; but at low Nile,
the velocity is reduced to at least one-fifth of this.
The filter-beds are on raised ground in the
desert, and consist, in the first place, of two huge
tanks, into which the water is always flowing;
from these it is admitted into eight filter-beds,
