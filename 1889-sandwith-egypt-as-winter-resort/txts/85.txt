Cairo. 69

accurate a picture of early Christian worship as
can anywhere be found. Some of them still have
convents adjoining, and are surrounded by thick
walls like a fortress, telling tales of old persecution
about the days of the fifth century, when the Bible
was translated into the Coptic tongue.

Besides some of the usually visited churches in
old Cairo, a Cept should be engaged to take the
visitor to the Church of the Virgin, near the
Mouski, where may be seen the original type of
the Coptic basilica, with a baldacclzino supported by
four columns and semicircular stone seats arranged
round the apse, and indeed much else of interest.

The modern Coptic cathedral is only worth
Visiting to see the service, such as on Easter Eve
or Easter Day; but it must be remembered that
their festivals sometimes take place according to
our calendar, and sometimes by the Old Style,
twelve days later.

A riding or driving excursion will of course be
made to the necropolis of Knit Bey, and to the
so-called tombs of the Mcmlooks.

The palaces of Shoobra, Ghezireh, and Ghizeh
are all worth visiting if a permit can be obtained,
because they have lovely gardens, and remind one
of the former glories of late Khedives. It is to the
last of these three that the Boulak Museum is now
being transferred.
