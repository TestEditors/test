Behind the town is a cemetery, the south end of
which contains graves of the Eighteenth to the
Twentieth Dynasties, while the north was used
during the Ptolemaic period. Many Greek and
demotic papyri were found with the cartonnages of
the mummies, and Boulak is now the proud possessor of two large bronze pans and three wooden
statuettes of the Nineteenth Dynasty.

It is to be regretted that, while so much has been
done by English enterprise, Boulak should have
so few results to show from its own excavations.
Many of the antiquities found pass into the hands
of dealers; and so lately as 1888 several statues
of great value of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties
were found at Memphis, and had afterwards to be
bought by the Boulak Museum.

before the Exodus, active literary intercourse was
going on between Babylon, Egypt, Palestine, and
Syria, and this was carried on by means of the

in modern times, though it must have taken years
