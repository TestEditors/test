110 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

dahabiyeh from Cairo, or send it up to Rodah or
Assiout and there join it by train, or, best of all,
engage a steamer to tow them at least as far as
Assiout. This is a very delightful way of travelling,
but the number of tow steamers is limited, and the
price often prohibitive. The ordinary dahabiyeh,
in going up stream against a current of three miles
an hour, is quite dependent on wind. Fortunately
the prevailing wind is from the north, the sails
are large, and the crew are clever to take all
advantage of it. It will take about two months to
get to the First Cataract and back, and three
months to go from Cairo to the Second Cataract
and back, and the cost for a party of four is about
twenty-five shillings per head per day.

There ought to be no mosquitoes on the Nile, or
other biting insects, but flies are often a great
trouble, and require Whisks, papers, and traps. It
is very cold at night, and ulsters, rugs, and other
warm wraps are necessary.

Temperature and climate on the Nile in winter.Dr. Patterson* gives an analysis for October, of
six daily observations during a voyage from Cairo
to Luxor and back. The thermometer varied from
68° at 7 a.m. to 826° at 3 p.m., the total mean
of the month being 76° Falun, and no rain fell
during the time.
