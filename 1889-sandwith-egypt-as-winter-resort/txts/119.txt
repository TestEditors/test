of cementing. In the Great Pyramid there are
2,300,000 stones, and blocks weighing about sixteen tons have vertical joints only one-fiftieth of an
inch thick in the easing. Fancy this for thirteen
acres of surface, and there are tens of thousands
of easing stones, none less than one ton in weight!

The granite Temple is connected with the Second
Pyramid by a causeway, and, to rightly understand
the Pyramids, it should be remembered that each
one had a temple on its east where the dead and
deified king was worshipped, just as humbler folk
worshipped their ancestors in their family tombs.

The guide-books tell of most of the tombs to be
seen here, but visitors often neglect to see the
galleries of the workmen, which are rather interesting. There are altogether ninety-one galleries,
9.1, ft. wide, and 7 ft. high, with an aggregate of
11, mile of length.

The Sphinx, as the largest and perhaps the oldest
sculptured figure in the world, is fascinating to all;
but those who wish to worship unrestrainedly,
must go there with a carefully chosen party by
moonlight. Perhaps the best view of it is obtained
from the steps facing it, which is probably the spot
chosen by the original worshippers of the god. As
visitors sometimes forget the sex of the Sphinx,
I may remind them that his beard, broken in
pieces, is now in the British Museum.
