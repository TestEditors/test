It is a favourite donkey-ride towards the so-called
petrified forest, and on the way one passes the
Red Hill, which is composed of a very hard Miocene
conglomerate of sand, pebbles, and fossil wood.
The two Colossi at Thebes were made of this stone,
and it is now used for maeadamizing roads, and
for making millstones.

Mineral springs-About half an hour south of
Cairo there is a spring in the desert, called AincZ-Syra. There is a dark greenish basin some
fifty yards square, surrounded by limestone formations, and with a thick deposit of black sulphur
mud. It has a great reputation among the natives
for skin-eruptions and especially for scabies, and its
votaries also drink from the sulphur spring which
feeds the basin, and which rids them of dyspepsia
and constipation. The temperature of the water is
1040 Fahr. beneath the surface, and 644Â° at the
surface on a winter day. Specific gravity 1'092.
