90 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Baths--In an establishment where crowned
heads are visitors, and which humbly imitates the
huge establishments in Europe, it is needless to
say that no cost has been spared in putting the
bath-houses into excellent order. Special arrangements are made for ladies, both natives and
Europeans. The corridors are paved with marble,
and fifteen bath-rooms and the actual baths are
made of enamelled porcelain tiles. Electric bells,
good furniture, ventilation, thermometer, sandglass, etc., are provided. There are shower-baths
and ordinary hot-water baths for those who do not
wish to undergo any cure, and delightful swimming-baths for the two sexes. The bath-rooms are
kept beautifully clean, and the ascent and descent
is made easy for those who are too crippled to
walk. An inhalation-room is provided for the
asthmatics who wish to inhale sulphuretted gas
straight from one of the springs.

The water that has been used in the baths is
run off into the desert two miles away by cemented
covered drains, and these have also been utilized
for draining the marshy parts of the desert land.
The result has been that malaria has disappeared,
the air is drier, and the spot as a health-resort is
rapidly increasing in popularity. An Austrian
medical man lives in the chief hotel, and has made
a speciality of electricity and electric baths.
