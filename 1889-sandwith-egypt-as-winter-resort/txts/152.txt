prevent natives from throwing carcasses or emptying drains into it, and they also flush the canal
every ten days with 500,000 tons of Nile water.

At high Nile the water is so muddy that it is

is pumped into the filter-beds. Also if chemical
analysis shows an abnormal percentage of organic
matter, permanganate of soda is mixed with the
water before it reaches the filter-beds. There are
three filter-beds, each 2400 yards square, and
covered with wood. The beds are 2 ft. 6 in. deep,

sea-shore near Damietta, and of four different sizes
of gravel, laid on bricks, and so placed as to
make a ready communication between the lower
layers and the pumps for cleansing purposes. The
sand is well washed in water, and the beds cleaned
every nine days. From the filter-beds the water
is pumped into a reservoir, and thence into Alexandria, at the rate of 26,000 cubic metres a day.

Though the water-supply is so well cared for,
the drainage of Alexandria cannot be commended.
Since 1871 the streets of the town have been
