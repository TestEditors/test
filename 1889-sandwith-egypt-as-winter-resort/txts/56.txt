40 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

week of the month is often hot, but previous to
that, during a south wind, the shade temperature
at noon is about 80°; indoors it is 64°; the barometer falls from 30 to 207, and there are 10°
difference between the wet and dry bulbs. Tourists
tire of Egypt at the first hot wind, and make for
Palestine, Constantinople, etc. Snipe, ducks, and
geese leave for Europe; excellent quail, spur-winged
plover, and dove shooting. Dianthus, pansy,
China aster, marguerites, delphinium, fuchsia,
gladiolus, lobelia, sweet pea, and wall-flowers.
Acacia trees in the boulevards shed their leaves
and remain bare for about a month.

April-The days are warm like the hottest days
in an English summer, but are not felt so oppressive because of the dryness of the air. The houses
and habits of the country are also specially adapted
for the hot weather. Rooms are now occupied
which face towards the north and catch the cool
wind, and on hot days it is wisest not to go out
immediately after luncheon. European/mousse
and hotels are built so that the rooms are sixteen
feet high, thus providing for plenty of cubic space
when the windows are obliged to be closed to keep
out the heat and the flies and mosquitoes, which
now begin to be troublesome. The khamseen wind
occurs at intervals of about ten days, and great
care ought to be taken not to relinquish all winter
