20 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

pendicular sepia-coloured mud-banks, which vary
slightly in colour, and have occasional thin layers
of drifted sand intervening. Wherever there is no
alluvium, which is of course the only soil in
Egypt, there is sterile desert, and this is the charm
of Luxor, and of the suburbs of Cairo. The Nile
soil is stated to be unlike any other in the world
in composition.

The Royal Society, with the aid of the Royal
Engineer Corps stationed at Cairo, has made several
borings through this soil to the old floor of the Delta.
The mixtures of blown sand and Nile alluvium
were found to continue down to the depth of
121 ft. from the surface, and 95 ft. below the level
of the Mediterranean. At that depth a remarkable change in the deposits took place, and beds
of gravel containing both pebbles and subangular
fragments of quartzite, chert, compact limestone,
with some metamorphic and igneous rocks, were
found, and similar beds occurred at intervals down
to the greatest depth reached. Up to the present
time no contemporaneous organic remains have
been found in these deposits. The borings near
the Nile at Cairo in 1883 may be briefly summarized thus: For 6 ft. beneath the surface, dry
mould; from 7 ft. to 16 ft., dry sandy mould; from
17 ft. to 38 ft., wet sand; and from 39 ft. to 45 ft.,
wet coarse sand.
