little marl and clay and fragments of Terebratula,
Ostrea, Pectcn, and Balanus, all considerably later
than the Eocene period, and tending to show that
there was once another sea margin 220 feet above
the Mediterranean and Red Sea. Near the
Pyramids again are raised beaches, limestone
pierced by Pholades and Ostrea undulata; and two
miles south of the Sphinx are fossil sea-urchins
(Clypeaster Egyptiacus), oyster-shells and pectens
('2 Post-Pliocene). The geological map shows
alluvial deposit everywhere in the Delta and along
the banks of the Nile, while to both east and west
of this near Cairo is nummulite limestone, and to
the north-east of Cairo are sandhills in the desert
stretching down to the Suez Canal. The incomparably dry pure air of Cairo and Upper Egypt
is due to this same nummulite limestone desert,
which for miles and miles acts as a great lung of
nature and purifies all the air which blows across
it, while the extraordinary fertility of Lower Egypt
is cauSed by the alluvial deposit. The absence
of vegetation and of moisturein the desert has
left its characters almost unaltered for ages, though
there is abundant evidence of mountain torrents
in prehistoric times and in the present day.

Lower Egypt consists geologically, therefore, of(1) Nummulite limestone of the Eocene period,
stretching southwards in the desert from Cairo
