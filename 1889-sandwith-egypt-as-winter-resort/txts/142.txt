126 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

sunset, the invalid can easily avoid all cold air,
and the risks of a sudden drop of the thermometer.
In March it will often be necessary to pursue the
opposite tactics, and shut windows during the
greatest heat of the day, to keep the bedroom from
getting too hot. This was not done in March,
1878, and consequently the bedroom average
jumped up to over 77째. Dr. Maclean made some
further experiments, to show that the lowest temperature in the bedroom was usually 20째 higher
than the lowest temperature in the shade, and
that a low bedroom heat depends chiefly on the
presence of a low shade minimum.

The daily range of the thermometer is always
very great, as one would expect in an inland dry
country of the latitude of Luxor. The temperature falls at night, in consequence of the rapid
radiation of heat which obtains under a cloudless
sky. But the range of maximum heat from one
day to another, for the first three months of the
year, is 3'1", 4'7째, 3'8째, showing that during the
portion of the twenty-four hours available for
the invalid the climate is remarkably equal.

The humidity is a good deal lower than that of
Cairo, being 16'5 per cent. less in January, 15 less
in February, and 11 less in March. The extremes
in January, 1878, at Luxor, were 74 and 33; in
February, 67 and 27; and in March the maximum
