Cairo. 29

Greenwich, which is 87, or with 70'7, which is the
record for Algiers in the year 1884.

But although Cairo is exceptionally dry, it has
its damp moods at times, and several times a year
for a few hours reaches saturation on the humidity
scale. During the khamseen wind the percentage
falls phenomenally lot-iso an absolute minimum
of 4 on March 24, 1888, and once even to 3 per
cent. in April, 1887.

Evaporation-The quantity of water evaporated
has been measured since 1887, and is obtained by
means of a vessel containing water protected by
coarse wire-gauze, and placed in the shade, but so
that air can pass freely over it. The difference
between the level of the water at any two observations gives the depth of water which has evaporated. The following are the numbers in inches
for 1888, which was an average dry year ;--January, 2'8; February, 2'8; March, 7'8; April, 7;
May, 8'1; June, 11; July, 15'5; August, 12'3;
September, 9'5; October, 7; November, 5; December, ~1'4--total, 93'7 inches. For practical
irrigation the evaporation in the basins is reckoned
at 7 inches a month all through the year.

Ruinfall.--Visit0rs sometimes come to Cairo
believing that it never rains there, which is, however, almost true of Luxor. Table I. shows clearly
that showers of rain are liable to fall during eight
