practical good from this annual washing of the
subsoil which must not be overlooked. For many
years the resident population has allowed its filth
to percolate into the porous soil and drain away as
it pleased till it joined the level of subsoil water,
and it is easy to conceive that if this earth were
not periodically cleansed and oxygenated by the
Nile infiltration, it would have long ceased to have
any beneficial properties as a sponge. This cleansing process, which takes place in September and
October, has, of course, the disadvantageous effect
of altering the level, not only of the infiltrated soil
water, but of the contents of all the uncemented
cesspools of former and more insanitary days.

It must be borne in mind that the subsoil water
has a slope of its own equal to that of the Delta,
viz. 1 in 10,000, and, instead of remaining local, is
constantly flowing northwards towards the sea.
This is easily proved by experiments in this Delta
or in India.

Sun, moon, and stars.--An average of eleven
years taken from the Greenwich records tells us
that there are in England only 1211 hours of bright
sunshine during the twelve months, or less than
two hours a day in the winter. It is unnecessary
to take a similar observation at Cairo, but Table I.
