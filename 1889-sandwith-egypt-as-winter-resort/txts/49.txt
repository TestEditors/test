other. This question is worthy of study, for no
intelligent man can undergo the odd experience of
this wind without being certain that some unusual
electrical disturbance is taking place.

The consideration of the effect of this disturbance
upon invalids is very important, and it may at

cases suffer less, because, unlike their more robust
