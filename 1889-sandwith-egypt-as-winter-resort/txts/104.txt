88 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

But, though I give an analysis of all three kinds
of waters, the only important one at present is the
sulphur variety. It owes its sulphur properties
to the chemical processes which sulphate of lime,
meeting with nitrogenous matter and becoming
sulphate of calcium, produces by setting free
carbonic acid and nitrogen from the decomposition
of the nitrogenous matter. Then the carbonic acid
decomposes the sulphate of calcium and forms
carbonate of lime, which, in presence of an excess
of carbonic acid and under great pressure, is converted into a very soluble bicarbonate of lime,
which at last sets free sulphuretted hydrogen gas.
The nitrogenous organic matter which is found
in all the Helouan waters has been named Barégine,
because it was first discovered in the Baréges
waters of the Pyrenees. It is found in all sulphur
waters when exposed to light and air, and is the
cause of the greenish vegetation which collects
round the edges of stagnant sulphur water. The
sulphur is sufficiently strong in the air to turn
silver ornaments black, but after the first day one
ceases to notice the odour.

History--The village is said to take its name
from the great grandson of a certain untraceable
king of Egypt. It is known to have been frequented in A.D. 690, and at other times by notables
who were driven out of Old Cairo by the plague,
