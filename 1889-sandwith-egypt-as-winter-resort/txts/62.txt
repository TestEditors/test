46 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

years among visitors, and three times among
resident Europeans who had previously suffered
from the disease in other countries. All were
mild cases, and yielded readily to saline aperients
and astringents, or ipecacuanha.

Of more than twenty cases of Enteric fever
which I have had to treat among the English and
Americans, only nine have occurred amongst the
visitors, and all recovered, and of these nine six
were ill of the disease when they arrived in Cairo,
having contracted it in Palestine (two), Naples
(two), Luxor, and during a Nile voyage. Of the
three remaining cases, one young lady had the
fever in 1883, when Cairo was much more insanitary than it is to-day; a second caught it in 1888,
while living against medical advice in a house
where there was no pretence of sanitation; and
the third was the English maid of the second,
who sickened after she and her mistress had been
removed to a clean house. After making careful
inquiry of my sanitary and medical colleagues,
I have not been able to hear of any case of enteric
among European civilians during the winter of
1888-9, excepting a few cases all imported from
elsewhere.

Cholera visited Egypt in 1865 and in 1883, but
not since, and the theory that it was endemic in the
country has not been borne out by late experience.
