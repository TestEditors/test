leather boots and shoes are commended to both

England to protect delicate eyes from the glare of
the sun and from sandstorms. Ladies who desire
to ride must bring their habits, and will be more
independent if they bring a saddle. Warm cloaks
and rugs are wanted in December and January,
and on the river always at night. Keating's
powder or Persian powder is wanted for insects.
Patent English or foreign medicines should be
brought by the invalid if required, though the local
druggists provide the public with the most commonly asked-for specialities. White umbrellas and
all common requisites can be bought in Cairo.

Ladies may be glad of the hint that silk or silk

underlinen.

Routes to Egypt--Those who are not afraid of
