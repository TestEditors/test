lends itself so easily to an outdoor life that no
one will be surprised to hear that the English
colony has introduced some British sports. If we
cross the Nile by its iron bridge, we at once come
to a large park between the river and one of its
branches. Here there are about fifty acres of
grass belonging to the Ghezireh Sporting Club,
and devoted to polo, cricket, football, golf, lawn
tennis, pigeon-shooting, etc. There is a course for
riding and for leaping, and every winter there are
two race meetings of two days each, three Skye
meetings, and six or seven Gymkhanas. Visitors
may become temporary members of the club on
paying Â£12. A regimental band plays most afternoons, and it is naturally the most favourite resort
in Cairo. Our foreign friends sometimes play
lawn-tennis, but usually confine themselves to
looking on at the English. There are half a dozen
lawn-tennis courts in the town, facilities for boxing
and fencing, and excellent hacks for riding or
driving all over the country.
