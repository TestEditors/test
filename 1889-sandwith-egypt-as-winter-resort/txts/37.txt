Cairo. 21

The subsoil of Cairo is washed every year by the
Nile, which brings to it in the summer the rain
from the mountains of Abyssinia. In June the
river at Cairo is at its lowest; then slowly begins
to rise throughout July, and reaches its maximum
flood in the first ten days of September, remaining
high during September; and in October attains an
artificial height, in consequence of the irrigation
basins in Upper Egypt then allowing the water
to escape and swirl on to complete the flood irrigation. During October the water gradually recedes
from the basins, and is carried all over Lower
Egypt by an elaborate system of canals, so that
the early months of the year become gradually
drier and drier, until the period of low Nile is
again reached in May.

In the ordinary flood-time, there is considerable
infiltration beneath the river-banks, besides the
desired inundation for the future crops, so that
the subsoil water rises in Cairo to a height of only
5 ft. from the ground surface, and at low Nile it
sinks again to about 19 l below the surface. We
may take it that during the Winter season the
subsoil water is more than 10 ft. from the ground.

NOW, although subsoil drainage in England
would seem to have resulted in an increase in the
health of the population, and an especial diminution of phthisis and enteric fever, there is one
