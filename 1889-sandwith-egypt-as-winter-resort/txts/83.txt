SiglzI-seeing.--There is a great deal to see in
and near Cairo, enough to occupy a serious-minded
individual for more than one winter, and fair
accounts of most of the sights may be found in
the guide-books. Besides the bazaars already
mentioned, where the products not only of Egypt,
but of Syria, Turkey, Persia, Tunis, and Asia
Minor may be bargained for, the original walls
and gates are well worth visiting. They date from
the eleventh and twelfth centuries, and the old
parts of the town, which are completely Oriental
and highly picturesque, contain houses which have
been built at all times during the last six hundred
years. Many streets still exist where beautiful
mushribyeh windows are numerous, and where
minarets and mosques produce a view which is
not seen in any other city. No greater change
can be experienced in leaving these Coptic and
Arab quarters than to find one's self in the
European district where broad streets are laid
out, and European houses and shops have been
built since 1865.
