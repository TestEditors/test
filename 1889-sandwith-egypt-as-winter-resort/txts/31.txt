Suez Canal. 15

in Egypt, and was one of the healthiest until the
boon of fresh water in great quantities after 1876
proved a curse by causing small swamps of water,
which percolated through the desert sand from the
new canals. The water-tanks in the gardens
which used to supply the houses, and occasionally
overflow, have been exchanged for a system of
pipes and taps. Eucalyptus trees also have been
planted, with a decided diminution of malaria.

SUEZ.

Suez is a town of 11,000 people, rather
more English than either Port Said or Ismailia,
and is of course the port of entry from India,
Australia, and the far East. There is a comfortable hotel, an English doctor, and a railway line
to Ismailia and Cairo, and a fresh-water canal
supplying it from the Nile. Excursions may be
made to the oasis called Moses' Well, to Ataka
mountain, to the sea-coast to collect shells, or to
Suakin.

Suez is in the same latitude as Cairo, and the
Ataka range stretches across the desert to join
Mokattam there.

Naturalists tell us that at Suez begins a genuine
tropical sea, differing entirely in its inhabitants
from the Mediterranean, only one day's journey
