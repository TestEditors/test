ment in every respect, except that she occasionally had
blood-stained expectoration in the morning. In September,
1889, her doctor reported that her improvement continued,
both lungs were sound, and there had been no more hemorrhage.

There is, as might be expected, great improvement in the
cases of lung-disease which apparently begin as pleurisy,
pleuro-pneumonia, or pneumonia, and anaemic, delicate,
looking people go home sunburnt, and able to walk, ride,
and play lawn-tennis, after two or three months' stay in
Cairo. The cases which do not improve much are often
those who will not stay indoors after twilight, and expose
themselves to cold and damp during December and January.

I have seen considerable improvement in some cases of
laryngeal phthisis, but more in the general state than locally.
Most of the cases of advanced phthisis which have grown
worse in Egypt have been complicated with chronic diarrhoea.
There are several apparently healthy residents now in Cairo
who originally came there from Europe for their health,
some of them having had haemoptysis and other lung
symptoms

Chronic bronchitis--A good many emphysematons patients
come to Cairo every winter, because they find they can get
through the cold months with less cough, less discomfort,
and far less confinement. Those whose bronchial tubes are
irritated by the fine dust in the air on sand-storm days must
then remain shut up in their houses, just as they would to
avoid fog, rain, and east wind elsewhere.

Asthma.--All the cases that I have seen in Egypt have
improved and done well, excepting two. Several former
asthmatic patients have settled down as residents in the
country, and one English lady, who has had dry asthma for
twenty yours, comes every year to Cairo and the Nile because
she is quite well there. Her brother and other relations
suffer from asthma, and she herself can live happily in
London, but in no other part of England that she has yet
