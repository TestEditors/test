aches are seldom met with except when Cairo is less dry
than usual. The sulphur baths at Helouan are, of course, a
useful help to the dry climate.

Rheumatoid arthritis I have only once seen in an Egyptian;
but every winter there are numbers of Europeans who come
to Cairo to get rid of their pain, stiffness, and swelling,
and to try and postpone their next acute attack. All
those that I have met with have greatly improved, and
among them is the ease of a lady who for this disease had

play lawn-tennis, or walk downstairs. Two months later she
