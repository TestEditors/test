Voyage up the Nile. 111

In November,' between Cairo and Assiout the
deck temperature varies from 53° at 7 a.m. to 63°
at noon and to 580 after sunset, which is also the
mean of the month. The wind is north to northeast; there is a little dew at night, and a warmer
coat is necessary on deck after sunset. The
saloon temperature of November varies from 55°
to 72°, with an average of 66°.

In December, Patterson gives as the result of
two years' observations (1860-1-2) a minimum on
deck of 47°, a maximum of 685°, and a mean of
57°. The range is greater, so that once on
December 29, the morning observation was 52°,
and at midday 72°. The saloon temperatures of
another observer give a minimum of 17°, - maximum,
79"; and mean, 63°; and his results of ninety-three
psychrometrical readings give as average humidity
in 1888, in the dahabiyeh saloon, 59 per cent,
with a range from 43 to 78. The thermometer is
highest at 3 p.m. and lowest between midnight
and 7 am. The air is driest in the afternoon,
and dampest in the early morning. Dr. F. S.
Worthington has also given me some careful daily
readings for December, 1888, between Cairo and a
few miles to its south. The barometer average
(corrected for sea-level) was 3019; in the dithebiyeh saloon the average maximum temperature

* Average of three observers.
