Excursions from Cairo. 73

which we can walk for miles without getting tired.
Moreover, our desert is by no means a perfect
desert like the Sahara, devoid of vegetation.

In February, after the winter rain, green herbs
and bushes sprout in the hollows, ravines, and
valleys, and the flora are at their finest in March
and April. After this the sun becomes too hot
for them, and in the summer only the deeperrooted trees and shrubs remain. The desert thorn
is beloved by camels; the zygophyllums are very
common and always succulent, but they are too
salt except for the hungriest camels. The bitter
colocynth and senna are used by the Bedouins.
The desert flora are by no means rich, but a
hundred species can be collected by diligent
amateurs, and the number of possible species
is six hundred. Desert plants cannot be cultivated in gardens; but, on the other hand, those
species that have found their way from civilized
spots into the wilds, seem to thrive untended in
the desert. Rabbits, hares, foxes, jerboas, and
lizards, all desert-coloured like the camel, are the
animals one meets with most often. In the neigh~'
beurhood of any old necropolis, we find bits of
granite and other monuments which have new
disappeared; relics of the flint age may be found
by careful searching, and many geological remains,
including numerous fragments of petrified wood.
