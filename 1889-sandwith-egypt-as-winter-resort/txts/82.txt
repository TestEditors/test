Fayoum and at Broullos, and lynx near Tel-elKebir; and in the desert there are jackal, liyena,
fox, bare, and the long-cared Fennec fox. From
October to March there is good snipe, duck, and
goose shooting, and from February to May there
is an abundance of quail. In February, 1889,
two English visitors made a bag of forty duck and
four hundred snipe in five days at Kafr-el-Sheikh,
