Cairo. 47

Dengue fever was present in 1880 and 1887, but
only from August to November: it is a painful
malady, without danger to life. Typhus and
relapsing fevers occur in the spring among overcrowded natives, but no case has been known
among Europeans. The plague left Egypt, we

parts of the world, is liable to occur among
those insufficiently protected by vaccination, but
I remember only one case of a visitor and one

for 1886-7-8, have averaged forty. Measles occasionally occurs as an epidemic among the natives,
and causes many deaths; but I know of no visitors
who have caught the disease, and only a dozen
residents. Botheln I have not yet heard of in
Egypt. Scarlatina is so rare that it is only heard
of at very rare intervals among the British troops.
Diphtheria is not uncommon among native children,
