and to the salts of potash and phosphoric acid dissolved and suspended in it. I should add that a
very laudatory report on the Cairo Company's
water, was made in 1889, by Professor Miintz, of
the National Agricultural Institute of Paris.

The following is an analysis of the solids in
Nile water taken on October 6, 1888, with the
probable chemical combinations (Pollard):


Calcic carbonate n. 3'521 grains per gallon.
Magnesia carbonate 1'421,,, ,
Silica 1'33,,, ,
Sodic sulphate'791,,, ,
Potassic sulphate'469,,, ,
Sodic carbonate'434,,, ,
Sodic chloride...'322,,, ,
Potassie nitrate'245,,, ,
Ferric and aluminic oxides'063,,, ,

The water, before being drunk in Cairo, is
passed through large earthenware jars, which are
found in every house, and constitute an excellent
filter, removing every trace of colour and cloudiness and all deposit, after the water has been
allowed to stand for twenty-four hours. DrinkingWatcr is further poured into porous vessels, where
it is kept deliciously cool, and gains an agreeable
taste. Charcoal filters and boiling are not necessary, but there is no difficulty about carrying this
out, if desired.
