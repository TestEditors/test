undergone concentration by evaporation, besides
having washed the lower strata, from which it
extracts chlorine.

As a confirmation of this, we see that the
chlorine is at its maximum just before the annual
flood.

The deficiency of nitrates is interesting, but does
not necessarily show an absence of defilement. The
softness of the water makes it very agreeable for
all domestic purposes; the slight variation in hardness is due to carbonate of lime, through which
the river has cut its way. The analyses of 1888-0
showed a trace of iron, but of no poisonous metals,
and no nitrites, and IIeisch's sewage test never
gave the slightest evidence of sewage contamination.

The unfiltered water should never be drunk by
visitors or residents, though the natives prefer it
infinitely. Some imprudent tourists drink it from
the dirty porous jars of the villagers, and must not
wonder at suffering occasionally in consequence.

The suspended matter, which is the chief fertilizing ingredient of the Nile, varies in quantity in
the most wonderful way. Mr. Pollard's figures
vary from'9 in July, to 1618 in September,
while Dr. Letheby found 33 in May, 1875, and
1044 grains in August, 1874. The fertility of the
flood, besides the clay, is due to the organic matter,
