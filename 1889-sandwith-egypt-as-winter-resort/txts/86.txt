70 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

Visitors interested in Oriental education will like
to see the Polytechnic School, that of the Arts and
Sciences, a charity for the deaf, dumb, and blind, and
the useful work started by the late Miss Whately.

The ordinary visitor demands at once to be
taken to see the howling and dancing dervishes,
and there are many other more interesting sects
whose monasteries he may visit if he will. Perhaps
one maybe forgiven for reminding him that their
fantastic worship plays to the Mussulman religion
a part something analogous to the Salvation Army
section of the Protestant Church.

But whether the traveller comes for days, weeks,
or months, let us impress upon him the absolute
duty of visiting Boulak Museum, and of not neglecting his chance of seeing monuments as old as
the Pyramids, wooden statues of much the same
date, a unique assembly of royal mummies and
portraits painted years before the Old Masters.
The great objection to the museum is that most of
the objects are not labelled, and that the catalogue
is atrociously bad. We may see there the jewellery
worn by an Egyptian queen three thousand six
hundred years ago, a trilingual inscription not
unlike the "Rosetta stone," and tables of kings
like the famous slab from Abydos. The museum
is better than any in Europe, and is rich especially
in monuments of the earliest Dynasties.
