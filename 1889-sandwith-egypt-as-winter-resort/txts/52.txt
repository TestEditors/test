36 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

river-flow, or the sand-blow of the country. There
is said to be only one evidence on the monuments
of rain having been known in Lower Egypt, and
we see around us to-day the mud-brick tombs
covered with stucco, dating from the Third or Fourth
Dynasty (13.0. 8800), when they were built without
any apparent fear of their dissolution.

First, let us take the number of days on which
rain fell in any one year in Cairo c-1798-1800......... 15 days.
1835~39 12,,
1857--61 13,,
1871 9,,
1887 15,,

This shows no perceptible difference, - but the.
annual rainfall for 1835-30 (Destrouches) is said
to have averaged less than half an inch, and if so,
we now have almost three times more rain than
formerly.

The following table shows a comparison of
mean temperatures at Cairo, taken at intervals
during the last hundred and twenty-eight years,
but not always at similar hours, which probably
accounts for the variation shown in column 4.
The net result shows no decided change in the
regularity of Cairo temperature.
