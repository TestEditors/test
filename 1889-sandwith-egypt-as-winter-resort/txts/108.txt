92 Egypt as a Winter Resort.

the whole time, he should invariably report progress
to his doctor during the third week of the cure, as
a tonic is then often necessary, and he may be
unconsciously overdoing the treatment.

Delicate people should begin with a temperature
not above 98Â°, should take a bath on alternate days,
and not for more than ten minutes at a time.

It is hardly necessary to remind patients whose
hearts are affected that they should have medical
advice upon the desirability of hot bathing. The
Helouan waters, as I have already said, are
stronger than those of Aix-les-Bains, but they have
not yet the advantage of being accompanied by all
the excellent system of douches and local massage
for which the Savoy resort is so famous.

Invalids are often chary of transporting themselves and their relatives from the gaieties of Cairo
to the solitude of Helouan, and to them it can
only be said that, if their physical strength permits, they are easily able to live in Cairo, and to
go four or five days a week to Helouan to take
their baths. But though some men and a few
women prefer to do this, there can be no doubt that
the purer air, earlier hours, and complete repose
of the desert life are most useful adjuncts to the
sulphur baths-and such invalids occasionally need
reminding that they have come abroad for their
health, and not for the distractions of their friends.
