nnacquainted with the lowest class of Egyptians
can form no idea of the filth in which they voluntarily live, of the habits of the nursing mothers,
and of their indifference to medical aid until the
child is actually dead. The apathy of the people
on this subject is perhaps partly due to the extraordinarily high birth-rate among the natives. The

Egyptian towns were-Sues and Ismailia, 54'2;
Cairo, 554; Alexandria, 57'9; and Port Said,
73'7. It is melancholy to reflect that one-third
of the native children die before they have lived
