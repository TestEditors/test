Ramleh has been a wonderfully healthy spot;
but the day will come when the subsoil will be
saturated with all the water used for the gardens,
baths, and kitchens, and some scheme of drainage
will be necessary.

The water-supply is pumped straight from the
canal of the Alexandria Company, unfiltered, to
a reservoir, and thence to Ramleh at the rate
of 12,000 cubic metres a day. For use in the

jars. The greater part of the water is of course

English flowers and fruits, one sees Oleanders,
point-settias, hibiscus, bougainvillia, begonia trees,
indiarubber trees towering almost as high as the
palms, and grapes, bananas, oranges, figs, and
melons. The desert abounds in a great variety of
small flowers; and one of the features of this
neighbourhood is the ice-plant (JIcscmbryanthemum
cristallinun0. Altogether the botanist will find
more than two hundred specimens of interest in
and near Ramleh, while the sea-coast is covered
with beautiful shells.

Amusements.--The English residents boast of as
