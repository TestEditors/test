CHAPTER VIII.
LUXOR~ASSOUAN.

LUXOR is becoming more and more popular every
winter, and as the season is a short one patients
have hardly time to get tired of its monotony. A
bright sunny sky, combined with healthy outdoor
exercise and interesting sights to visit, is a great
help towards cheerfulness, and to this we may
add a dry bracing climate, and freedom from rain
and all atmospheric impurities.

Dr. Patterson long ago described the Egyptian
climate as possessing the warmth of Madeira,
without its terrible damp and relaxing influence.
The days for sending consumptive patients to hot,
damp climates are almost at an end. In writing
of Luxor I cannot do better than supplement Dr.
Maclean's" pamphlet, which appeared after his
death, and contained his own experiences as an
invalid during the winters of 1877-8-0.

Climate of Luxor and Egypt." 1881.
