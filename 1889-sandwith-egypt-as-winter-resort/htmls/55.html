</span>Starlings arrive. Oranges and lemons again, as in<br/>
all the winter months. Balsam and heliotrope.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span>--There is often a cold <span style="color: #0000FF;">south </span>wind from<br/>
the desert, and though the days are not really cold,<br/>
the evenings require a fire indoors and an overcoat abroad. Lung invalids ought not to be out<br/>
after sunset. Temperature like the last week of<br/>
September in England. Quail return to Upper<br/>
Egypt from the Soudan. Roses bloom all the<br/>
year round in Cairo, but they are now at their<br/>
best. Hyacinth, camellia, mignonette, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ranunculus</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">cyclamen</span>, verbena, gypsophila, and orange-flowers.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">February.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Temperature </span>like a dry English<br/>
September, chilly at the<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>beginning of the month,<br/>
but warm and pleasant at the end, so that fires<br/>
and overcoats are hardly wanted at night. Invalids<br/>
return from Luxor to Cairo at the end of February<br/>
to escape the south winds, which begin earlier<br/>
there. Quail breed in Upper Egypt, and appear<br/>
again in Lower Egypt; starlings take their flight.<br/>
Oranges, lemons, and loquats. Violets, petunias,<br/>
phlox, bougainvillia, and roses.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jlarrlt.-TernperMure </span>is a little like London in<br/>
July, but the great feature of this month is the<br/>
south wind, which is almost certain to blow at least<br/>
twice for two or three days at a time. It is at first<br/>
welcomed as a pleasant change after the cold<br/>
weather, but soon becomes disagreeable. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">last<br/>
