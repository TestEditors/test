<span>52 Egypt as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
The water, when filtered through double paper,<br/>
is perfectly clear, and has a greyish yellow colour,<br/>
varying in depth, but always to be observed in<br/>
thin glass vessels. Its taste is usually considered<br/>
very agreeable, and the Arabs have a proverb that<br/>
he who once drinks it becomes enamoured of<br/>
Egypt. At the foot of the table I have made a<br/>
comparison between the average water of the year,<br/>
the average of the winter months (November 3 to<br/>
May <span style="color: #0000FF;">18 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">)</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is seen to be much less thick<br/>
before filtered, and a little purer than the year's<br/>
average after <span style="color: #0000FF;">filtration-and </span>also the water of the<br/>
New River Company which supplies the north of<br/>
London and the City, and is purer than that furnished by the Thames Companies. It will be seen<br/>
that the Cairo water compares satisfactorily with<br/>
that of London.<br/>
<br/>
The amount of oxygen absorbed was determined<br/>
by the French official process. The amount of<br/>
chlorine varies very considerably, and this has<br/>
already been pointed <span style="color: #0000FF;">out</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>Professor <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wanklypfit<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Who </span>explains the <span style="color: #0000FF;">variability </span>by saying that the<br/>
storm-water of the flood sweeps over the surface of<br/>
ground long ago denuded of salt, and therefore<br/>
furnishing but little chlorine. On the other hand,<br/>
when the river has fallen, it receives water which<br/>
has passed deeper into the ground, and which has<br/>
