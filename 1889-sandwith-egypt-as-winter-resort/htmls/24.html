<span>8 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>

a tendency to apoplexy; but the sun at Cairo is<br/>
not powerful till April, and then a helmet is sufficient protection.<br/>
<br/>
Former writers have said that phthisis with a<br/>
tendency to <span style="color: #0000FF;">haemorrhage </span>should not be sent to<br/>
Egypt; but I see no reason why they should not<br/>
winter in Egypt, provided they exchange the undue<br/>
stimulation of Cairo "<span style="color: #ff0000;">khamseens</span>" in April for<br/>
the sea-breezes of Ramleh.<br/>
<br/>
Phthisical patients with a previous history of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">haemoptysis </span>do not usually suffer from <span style="color: #0000FF;">haemorrhage<br/>
</span>in Egypt, and, moreover, it is not a common<br/>
symptom in the cases of phthisis which one sees<br/>
among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">negroes </span>and other natives of the<br/>
country.<br/>
<br/>
Outfit <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Clothing</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">Let </span>us take this opportunity of telling our countrymen, and especially<br/>
our <span style="color: #ff0000;">countrywomen</span>, that it is no longer necessary<br/>
to buy from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">outfitter </span>the travelling kit which<br/>
is based on patterns at least forty years old. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dustcloaks</span>, helmets, blue veils, goggles, <span style="color: #ff0000;">pugries</span>, and<br/>
field-glasses are not becoming, and are not needful<br/>
for walking or driving in Cairo. Let the visitor<br/>
bring such clothing as he wears in England in the<br/>
summer and autumn, and he will want little else<br/>
beside. Flannel belts to be worn next to the skin<br/>
are of great assistance in preventing attacks of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">diarrhea</span>. Helmets for wearing up the Nile <span style="color: #0000FF;">can<br/>
