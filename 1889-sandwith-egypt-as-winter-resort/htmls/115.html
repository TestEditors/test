</span>improved markedly in health and strength. He<br/>
remained there two winters and a summer, and<br/>
was progressing well until he was persuaded, during<br/>
the second summer, to try <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>change to the mountain<br/>
air of Cyprus, where he very soon died. Before<br/>
his death he had commenced to build a sanatorium,<br/>
to give others the opportunity of living in a climate<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>had apparently been so beneficial to himself.<br/>
<br/>
The property was then bought by an English<br/>
resident of Cairo, who determined to open an hotel,<br/>
and, while providing <span style="color: #ff0000;">Visitors </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">with </span>all necessary<br/>
luxuries, to prevent the neighbourhood of the<br/>
Pyramids from being spoilt by incongruous behaviour. The hotel at once became popular, in consequence of the extreme purity of the air, the<br/>
delicious repose of the desert, the convenient<br/>
proximity to Cairo, and the unrivalled interest of<br/>
the locality. Twice its owner has had to treble<br/>
its size, and now it contains eighty bedrooms, a<br/>
dining-room 40 <span style="color: #0000FF;">M </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">so </span>ft., another 40 <span style="color: #ff0000;">X </span>27 <span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>, smaller<br/>

for artists, etc. There is a Jenning's lavatory, and<br/>
the earth-closets are in a building disconnected<br/>
from the hotel. There are six fixed baths, hot and<br/>
cold, and the bath and sink water is used to irrigate<br/>
the garden; also <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">swimming-bath</span>, 80 X 25 <span style="color: #0000FF;">ft</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/>
