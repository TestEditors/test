<span>104 Egypt as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Resort.<br/>
<br/>
Near the Third Pyramid there are the ruins of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Graeco-Roman </span>village.<br/>
<br/>
Besides the ride to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah</span>, excursions may be<br/>
made to the Pyramid of Abu Roash, or to a petrified<br/>
forest seven miles away.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">MATARIYEH</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Five miles to the north-east of Cairo, and now<br/>
connected with it by train and telephone, is the<br/>
village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyeh</span>, which has lately become a<br/>
popular suburb among some of the European and<br/>
native residents.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>Easter Monday, <span style="color: #ff0000;">1889</span>, which is a national<br/>
holiday in Egypt, 19,000 people were conveyed to<br/>
it by train. At other times it is dull and empty,<br/>
though two small hotels have lately sprung up,<br/>
besides restaurants and many private villas. There<br/>
is some talk of building an English hotel near the<br/>
plain where, in A.D. 1517, the battle of Heliopolis<br/>
made the Turks masters of Egypt, and where<br/>
Kleber regained Cairo for a short time in 1800.<br/>
The attractions offered to the guests would be<br/>
camel-riding in the desert to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh</span>, which was<br/>
a suburb built in 1849 to please the Bedouin sheiks<br/>
who declined to enter the city of Abbas, the then<br/>
Khedive, or to the ostrich-farm and orange-groves<br/>
in the neighbourhood. Then there are the <span style="color: #ff0000;">petri<br/>
<br/>
