<br/>
temperature of all three resorts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Helouan</span>, Pyramids,<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matariyeh</span>, may be taken as the same as that<br/>
given for Cairo, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">difference </span>of a little less<br/>
humidity in their favour. As in Cairo, there is a<br/>
great fall in temperature soon after the sun has<br/>
set, and invalids must either be indoors or provided<br/>
with wraps, but fortunately there is no danger of<br/>
malaria.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Siot-seeiur</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">About </span>forty years ago, when<br/>
Lepsius visited the Pyramids, and had his encampment partly washed away by a fierce rain-storm,<br/>
there were no less than sixty-five Pyramids on the<br/>
plateau of Ghizeh; but now there are only nine<br/>
recognized, and of these visitors pay homage to<br/>
the three largest. I have so often been summoned<br/>
to attend patients with weak hearts who have<br/>
suffered after rapidly ascending the Great Pyramid,<br/>
that <span style="color: #0000FF;">i </span>am constrained to warn all those who are<br/>
elderly and delicate from <span style="color: #0000FF;">attempting </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">it</span>. The climb<br/>
is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>difficult one of at least twenty or thirty minutes,<br/>
and the only satisfaction to be gained is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">View </span>from the summit. The staff on the top of<br/>
this Pyramid dates from the transit of Venus<br/>
expedition of 1874.<br/>
<br/>
There are always Bedouins who will be delighted<br/>
for a small sum to ascend one or both Pyramids<br/>
in an incredibly short time, and a patient of mine<br/>
with a weak heart was induced last winter <span style="color: #0000FF;">after<br/>
<br/>
