<span>90 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Baths</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span>an establishment where crowned<br/>
heads are visitors, and which humbly imitates the<br/>
huge establishments in Europe, it is needless to<br/>
say that no cost has been spared in putting the<br/>
bath-houses into excellent order. Special arrangements are made for ladies, both natives and<br/>
Europeans. The corridors are paved with marble,<br/>
and fifteen bath-rooms and the actual baths are<br/>
made of enamelled porcelain tiles. Electric bells,<br/>
good furniture, ventilation, thermometer, sandglass, etc., are provided. There are shower-baths<br/>
and ordinary hot-water baths for those who do not<br/>
wish to undergo any cure, and delightful swimming-baths for the two sexes. The bath-rooms are<br/>
kept beautifully clean, and the ascent and descent<br/>
is made easy for those who are too crippled to<br/>
walk. An <span style="color: #0000FF;">inhalation-room </span>is provided for the<br/>
asthmatics who wish to inhale sulphuretted gas<br/>
straight from one of the springs.<br/>
<br/>
The water that has been used in the baths is<br/>
run off into the desert two miles away by cemented<br/>
covered drains, and these have also been utilized<br/>
for draining the marshy parts of the desert land.<br/>
The result has been that malaria has disappeared,<br/>
the air is drier, and the spot as a health-resort is<br/>
rapidly increasing in popularity. An Austrian<br/>
medical man lives in the chief hotel, and has made<br/>
a speciality of electricity and electric baths<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
