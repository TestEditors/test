of cementing. In the Great Pyramid there are<br/>
2,300,000 stones, and blocks weighing about sixteen tons have vertical joints only one-fiftieth of an<br/>
inch thick in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">easing</span>. Fancy this for thirteen<br/>
acres of surface, and there are tens of thousands<br/>
of easing stones, none less than one ton in <span style="color: #0000FF;">weight</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">!<br/>

</span>The granite Temple is connected with the Second<br/>
Pyramid by a causeway, and, to rightly understand<br/>
the Pyramids, it should be remembered that each<br/>
one had a temple on its east where the dead and<br/>
deified king was worshipped, just as humbler folk<br/>
worshipped their ancestors in their family tombs.<br/>
<br/>
The guide-books tell of most of the tombs to be<br/>
seen here, but visitors often neglect to see the<br/>
galleries of the workmen, which are rather interesting. There are altogether ninety-one galleries,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">9.1</span>, ft. wide, and 7 ft. high, with an aggregate of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">11</span>, mile of length.<br/>
<br/>
The Sphinx, as the largest and perhaps the oldest<br/>
sculptured figure in the world, is fascinating to all;<br/>
but those who wish to worship unrestrainedly,<br/>
must go there with a carefully chosen party by<br/>
moonlight. Perhaps the best view of it is obtained<br/>
from the steps facing it, which is probably the spot<br/>
chosen by the original worshippers of the god. As<br/>
visitors sometimes forget the sex of the Sphinx,<br/>
I may remind them that his beard, broken in<br/>
pieces, is now in the British Museum<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
