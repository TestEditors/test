<span>Cairo. 27<br/>
<br/>
was <span style="color: #0000FF;">1118</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>on July 13, while on the night of<br/>
January 20, the absolute minimum of <span style="color: #ff0000;">384</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>was<br/>
recorded. In 1887, the highest maximum was<br/>
110째 on June 9, and the lowest minimum<br/>
was 35<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Y </span>in January. Freezing-point seems<br/>
never to be reached in Cairo; but a shallow dish<br/>
of water placed in the wind on the ground in the<br/>
desert, may be found occasionally with a thin<br/>
coating of ice. I may say here, for the information of those who believe that Cairo is a furnace<br/>
in the summer, that the indoor temperature of<br/>
rooms on the north side of the house, kept properly shut during the hot hours, need never during<br/>
the year exceed 83째 Fahr.; and, on the other<br/>
hand, that the same rooms, during the depths of<br/>
winter, if properly opened to receive the warm<br/>
outer air during the day, need never have <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>temperature below 52째 Fahr., without employing a<br/>
fire. By living in sunny south rooms, or by employing artificial heat, the invalid can be certain<br/>
all night in the winter of a temperature of 65째<br/>
Fahr., or more.<br/>
<br/>
My observations, therefore, correspond with the<br/>
results obtained by the Rev. Dr. Barnett in Cairo,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>I give in Table II. For nearly two years<br/>
he took observations six times daily, from 6 <span style="color: #0000FF;">a.m.<br/>
</span>to 9 p.m., to ascertain the indoor temperature of<br/>
an ordinary house<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
