<span>76 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>

train; or delicate people who wish to minimize the<br/>
fatigue may sleep at Helouan overnight, and cross<br/>
the river next morning. Those <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>love riding<br/>
can mount their ponies at Mena Hotel, and ride<br/>
along the desert to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah</span>, passing the Pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abooseer </span>and the remains of several miles<br/>
of cemeteries. The day's excursion is a very<br/>
delightful one, but it is very tiring to those unaccustomed to <span style="color: #0000FF;">donkey-riding</span>. Early in the winter the<br/>
scenery is quite <span style="color: #0000FF;">lovely-the </span>inundation covering<br/>
the fields, and the peasants swarming up the lofty<br/>
date palms to gather the fruit which grows so well<br/>
on the site of Memphis. In the spring the waters<br/>
have subsided again, and the mounds and pottery<br/>
which represent the old city, can be better seen.<br/>

A huge fallen statue of Rameses II. was raised<br/>
out of a pond by a few English subscribers in<br/>
1887, and in working at it another colossus was<br/>
<br/>
discovered close by. It is not generally known that<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the Egyptian antiquities on Shepheard's balcony<br/>
came from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sakk√©rah</span>, and bear evidence of having<br/>
been visited in situ by Greek tourists, who scribbled<br/>
their names in the days long ago before the stones<br/>
were buried in sand, and then once more discovered by Mariette. Boulak and many European<br/>
museums have been largely enriched by the treasures of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkarah</span>, which represents about four<br/>
square miles of the necropolis of Memphis. <span style="color: #ff0000;">The<br/>
