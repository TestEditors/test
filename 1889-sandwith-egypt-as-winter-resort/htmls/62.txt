years among visitors, and three times among<br/>
resident Europeans who had previously suffered<br/>
from the disease in other countries. All were<br/>
mild cases, and yielded readily to saline aperients<br/>
and astringents, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ipecacuanha</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Of more than twenty cases of Enteric fever<br/>
which I have had to treat among the English and<br/>
Americans, only nine have occurred amongst the<br/>
visitors, and all recovered, and of these nine six<br/>
were ill of the disease when they arrived in Cairo,<br/>
having contracted it in Palestine (two), Naples<br/>
(two), Luxor, and during a Nile voyage. Of the<br/>
three remaining cases, one young lady had the<br/>
fever in 1883, when Cairo was much more insanitary than it is to-day; a second caught it in 1888,<br/>
while living against medical advice in a house<br/>
where there was no pretence of sanitation; and<br/>
the third was the English maid of the second,<br/>
who sickened after she and her mistress had been<br/>
removed to a clean house. After making careful<br/>
inquiry of my sanitary and medical <span style="color: #0000FF;">colleagues</span>,<br/>
I have not been able to hear of any case of enteric<br/>
among European civilians during the winter of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">1888-9</span>, excepting a few <span style="color: #0000FF;">cases </span>all imported from<br/>
elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
Cholera visited Egypt in 1865 and in 1883, but<br/>
not since, and the theory that it was endemic in the<br/>
country has not been borne out by late experience<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
