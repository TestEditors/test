<span>132 Egypt as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Resort.<br/>
<br/>
outside the town of Suakin. It may therefore be<br/>
wise to state exactly what is the disposition of the<br/>
troops which have to defend Egypt and its <span style="color: #ff0000;">Visitors<br/>
</span>from any hypothetical hordes of invading <span style="color: #0000FF;">dervishes</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Suakin is a port on the Red Sea, which by a <span style="color: #ff0000;">fastsailing </span>steamer can only be reached in eight days<br/>
from Cairo. It is well fortified and garrisoned by<br/>
3000 Egyptian and black soldiers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">officered </span>by the<br/>
British army, who are well able to repel any<br/>
advances of the Soudanese, and can, if necessary,<br/>
be strengthened by English troops.<br/>
<br/>
At Wady Halfa, which is eight hundred miles<br/>
from Cairo, and separated from it by a distance<br/>
which can only be traversed in ten days by the<br/>
fastest steamers, there are more than 3000 <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptian<br/>
</span>and black soldiers, again commanded by Englishmen. There are also many strong forts, for the<br/>
English policy is to act entirely on the defensive<br/>
until the raids of the Soudanese become so impudent that it is absolutely necessary to chastise<br/>
them, as in August, 1889. At Assouan, I have<br/>
already said, there are forts manned by 2000 of<br/>
the Egyptian army. In Cairo and Alexandria<br/>
there are 3000 English soldiers of all branches of<br/>
the service, who can be moved to any spot should<br/>
danger threaten, and can be reinforced from Malta,<br/>
Gibraltar, Cyprus, or from troops passing through<br/>
the Suez Canal to or from India. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Soudanese<br/>
