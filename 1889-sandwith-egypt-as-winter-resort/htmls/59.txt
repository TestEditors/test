<br/>
Public health in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">There </span>has been no census<br/>
since 1882, and it is doubtful whether the statistics<br/>
then gathered are <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficiently </span>accurate. There are<br/>
believed to be about 375,000 inhabitants, of <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom<br/>
</span>21,650 are not Turkish subjects, and are mostly<br/>
Europeans. The deaths among Europeans during<br/>
the last seven years, including the cholera year,<br/>
have averaged 473, <span style="color: #0000FF;">01</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">218 </span>per 1000 per annum,<br/>
which compares <span style="color: #ff0000;">favourably </span>with any town in<br/>
Europe <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>America. But the figures ought probably to be higher, as it is <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to conceive that<br/>
the lowest classes of Maltese, Jews, Greeks, and<br/>
Levantines, who are all included among the<br/>
foreigners, must not considerably deteriorate the<br/>
mortality rate. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">death-rate </span>among the natives<br/>
is shockingly high, <span style="color: #0000FF;">405 </span>per 1000, and this is principally due to the mortality (800 a month) of<br/>
infants under one year of age during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">four<br/>
