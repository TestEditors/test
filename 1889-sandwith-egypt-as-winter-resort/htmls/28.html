PORT SAID.<br/>
<br/>
THE visitor is not recommended to stay in any of<br/>
the three towns on the Suez Canal, but he must<br/>
pass through one of them unless he arrives from<br/>
Europe by way of Alexandria. Port Said, <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>a<br/>
population of about 10,500 natives and 6000<br/>
Europeans, is an impromptu insanitary town<br/>
which originated in 1859 with the huts of the<br/>
Canal workmen. It stands on a narrow strip of<br/>
sand two hundred to three hundred yards wide,<br/>
between Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Meuzaleh </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>sea, its site<br/>
having been formed by dredgings from the harbour<br/>
thrown into the shallow lake. The surface of the<br/>
town is perfectly flat, and only about four feet<br/>
above the sea-level, and the sandy soil is permeated<br/>
by <span style="color: #0000FF;">uncemented </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cesspools </span>and underground reservoirs used by some of the inhabitants. It is<br/>
dependent on Cairo for a water-supply <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>Ismailia<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
