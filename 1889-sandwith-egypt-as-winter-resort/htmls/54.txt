<span>38 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo after the middle of the month, because the<br/>
summer is then rather suddenly at an end, and<br/>
winter clothing is issued to the troops. But the<br/>
proportion of heat to dampness is still great,<br/>
mosquitoes are rampant, and invalids are not<br/>
advised to arrive till the last days<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>of the month<br/>
at the very earliest. Quail are already in Upper<br/>
Egypt, and snipe, ducks, and geese are arriving.<br/>
Fresh dates are at their best, grapes, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">custardapples</span>. Bananas have begun, and continue all the<br/>
winter. Among flowers there are dahlia, Zinnia,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">periwinkle</span>, and tuberoses.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">November.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>beautiful month for invalids to<br/>
arrive, and before the crush of pleasure-seekers,<br/>
so that good rooms can be easily secured. The<br/>
Nile inundation is still out between the town and<br/>
the Pyramids, and the sunsets are perhaps more<br/>
beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">than </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>any other time of year. Weather<br/>
no longer too hot for outdoor exercise. Mosquitoes<br/>
disappearing, though nets are always wanted at<br/>
night throughout the year, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fir-skinned<br/>
</span>strangers suffer until they become <span style="color: #ff0000;">acelimatized</span>.<br/>
Oranges and lemons. Chrysanthemums and lovely<br/>
pointsettia shrubs.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">December.</span>--At the end of the month we are<br/>
liable to a little cloud and rain, and invalids who<br/>
want to avoid all cold damp should go up to Luxor.<br/>
Temperature like a dry September in England<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
