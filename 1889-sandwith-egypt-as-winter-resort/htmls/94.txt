<span>78 Egypt as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Resort.<br/>
<br/>
Pithon (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-el-Maskhuta</span>), near the modern station<br/>
called Rameses, between Zagazig and Ismailia.<br/>
From here statues have been sent to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Boulak </span>and<br/>
the British Museum, and there are still remains<br/>
of the Nineteenth Dynasty, and of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the'stove-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">chambers </span>built by the Israelites.<br/>
<br/>
2. Goshen (Saft-el-Hennah), near the railway<br/>
stations of Zagazig and Abu Hamad<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A large<br/>
sculptured shrine of the Thirtieth Dynasty now in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Boulak </span>came from there, but to-day there is<br/>
nothing of special interest on the site.<br/>
<br/>
3. Tanis (<span style="color: #0000FF;">San-el-Haggar</span>), twenty miles from<br/>
Fakus by boat or donkey, and therefore rather<br/>
troublesome to reach. There is an enormous<br/>
temple, with statues of different periods from<br/>
Twelfth to Nineteenth Dynasties, and it is the<br/>
finest place for the tourist to visit till he gets<br/>
southward to Thebes. It was excavated by Mariette<br/>
and finished by Mr. Petrie, and large numbers of<br/>
papyri were sent from it to the British Museum.<br/>
<br/>
4. Tel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedowi </span>and Nebesheh stand half-way<br/>
from Fakus to Tanis, and have furnished many<br/>
gifts to the British Museum. There are still the<br/>
temple of Aahmes of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, a<br/>
large shrine of Uati, and tombs and cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
5. Zagazig (Tel Basta, or the Pibeseth of the<br/>
Old Testament). There are records dating from<br/>
the Fourth to Thirtieth Dynasties, and from <span style="color: #0000FF;">here<br/>
<br/>
