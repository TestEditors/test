north of it. Hermit crabs and very many others<br/>
of the crab family, bivalves and univalves, starshaped egg-urchins (Echinometra lucunter), crustaceans, sponges, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">coral</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fish</span>, with many scores<br/>
of others, can be found by exploring the coast and<br/>
rocky pools.<br/>
<br/>
By means of a boat on a clear day, a visit to the<br/>
coral reefs may be made, though the best coral is<br/>
at some distance from Suez. Dark brown and<br/>
yellowish green coral in loose and brittle bits is<br/>
based here on massive rocks of black mesh coral<br/>
(Porites), and more rarely there may be found the<br/>
cherry-red cup-star variety (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pocillopora</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-not </span>to<br/>
be confounded with the ordinary red coral, which<br/>
is not found here.<br/>
<br/>
The strange and wonderful fishes can be best<br/>
seen by going to the market, no less than five<br/>
hundred and twenty kinds which haunt the coral<br/>
slopes being known. One often offered for sale is<br/>
the ball-fish (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tetredon</span>), which has the power of<br/>
blowing itself up like a balloon and floating on<br/>
the water on its back; this, like the urchin-fish<br/>
(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodon</span>), is protected like a hedgehog on land by<br/>
spiny prickles, beside a beak something like a<br/>
parrot's. They can bite well with their beaks, but<br/>
are not poisonous. Small sharks are occasionally<br/>
heard of, leaping and flying-fish, and the gay parrot<br/>
and rainbow fishes are also known<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
