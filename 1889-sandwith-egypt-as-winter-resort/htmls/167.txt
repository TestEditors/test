aches are seldom met with except when Cairo is less dry<br/>
than usual. The sulphur baths at Helouan are, of course, a<br/>
useful help to the dry climate.<br/>
<br/>
Rheumatoid arthritis <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span>have only once seen in an Egyptian;<br/>
but every winter there are numbers of Europeans who come<br/>
to Cairo to get rid of their pain, stiffness, and swelling,<br/>
and to try and postpone their next acute attack. All<br/>
those that I have met with have greatly improved, and<br/>
among them is the <span style="color: #ff0000;">ease </span>of a lady who for this disease had<br/>
had a previous experience of Buxton, Bath, San Remo,<br/>
Cannes, Algiers, Pau, Biarritz, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wiesbaden</span>, and Spain. She<br/>
has now been for three years running to Cairo, and believes<br/>
that the climate is the best she has yet tried. She has had<br/>
rheumatic attacks for fifteen years, and for nearly all that<br/>
time has had her joints anchylosed and swollen, so that the<br/>
only ones which remained free were the hips, toes, and<br/>
vertebrae.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of the second winter in Cairo, she could stand<br/>
and walk alone and almost upright, and was delighted with<br/>
her own activity. She took no drugs, had no sulphur baths,<br/>
and no massage during that winter, and only consulted her<br/>
doctor upon one day.<br/>
<br/>
She has a distinct family predisposition towards rheumatism; her father was very gouty, mother rheumatic,<br/>
mother's father very gouty, and all maternal relatives are<br/>
rheumatic. She has lost a sister of rheumatic fever, and<br/>
has living a brother who has heart-disease and has had<br/>
rheumatic fever three times, and a sister who has chronic<br/>
rheumatism after an acute attack<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Another case was that of a lady with a strong family<br/>
history of rheumatism, and a personal history of four years.<br/>
She had previously tried <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buxton</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Strathpeffer</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Wildbad</span>,<br/>
sulphur baths, and massage, with a little temporary improvement after each. <span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>she reached Cairo she could walk<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">stifily</span>, but for three years had been unable to run, dance,<br/>
play <span style="color: #0000FF;">lawn-tennis</span>, or walk downstairs. Two months later <span style="color: #0000FF;">she<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
