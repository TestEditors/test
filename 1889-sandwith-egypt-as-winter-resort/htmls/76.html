<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">BO </span>Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Carriages</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span>ordinary street carriage is a<br/>
comfortable two-horsed Victoria at a modest tariff.<br/>
There are landaus for those who wish them, and<br/>
also broughams for going out at night. The roads<br/>
are wide and good, and shaded better than almost<br/>
any other city with avenues of acacia (Albizzia<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lebbek</span>), so that carriage-exercise is rendered very<br/>
easy and agreeable.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Riding.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Excellent </span>country-bred and Syrian<br/>
ponies can be hired by the day, but a visitor intending to spend the winter generally does better to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">buy </span>a mount for £18 or £25. Donkey-riding is<br/>
very cheap, very healthy, and at times enjoyable.<br/>
Camels can be obtained for the desert, but are out<br/>
of place in crowded streets rendered slippery by<br/>
watering.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Doctors-commencing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with our own countrymen, there are two Aberdonians, who have been<br/>
respectively twenty-seven and nine years in Egypt,<br/>
and a Londoner, who has practised in Cairo for<br/>
six years. There is another Englishman <span style="color: #0000FF;">who<br/>
</span>practises chiefly among the natives, and has a<br/>
growing surgical reputation; six English doctors<br/>
in the Government service are available for consultation; and there are always a similar number in<br/>
the English Army. There are German, Scotch,<br/>
and American oculists, a good English dentist,<br/>
and more than a dozen foreign medical men (<span style="color: #0000FF;">some<br/>
