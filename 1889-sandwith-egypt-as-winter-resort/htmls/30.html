<span>14 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
during the winter season, crowded to overflowing<br/>
with hungry tourists. There are no places of<br/>
interest to visit, and little to do besides sea-bathing<br/>
in Lake Timsah, and donkey-riding along famous<br/>
broad roads lined with sweet-smelling trees.<br/>
<br/>
A fresh-water canal runs from Cairo to supply<br/>
the waterworks, and the consequent mixture of<br/>
fresh and salt water since 1869 is thought by the<br/>
inhabitants to be responsible for the malarial fever<br/>
for which Ismailia has of late years become<br/>
unpleasantly noted in a country where malarial<br/>
diseases are very rare.<br/>
<br/>
There is a French hospital beautifully situated<br/>
outside the town, and a French and a Greek<br/>
doctor. The monuments now in the square at<br/>
Ismailia, <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>in Syene granite and diorite from<br/>
Assouan, were brought from the ruins of Pithom,<br/>
about twelve miles west of Ismailia. Pithom was<br/>
apparently one of the garrison towns built by the<br/>
Israelites for Rameses II. in the land of Goshen,<br/>
and near it they <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamped </span>upon the second night<br/>
of the Exodus, just as Lord Wolseley did in 1882<br/>
in the same district, now called Kassassin. The<br/>
third night the fleeing Israelites halted close to<br/>
Ismailia, and on the fifth day of their flight they<br/>
are believed to have crossed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sea </span>about halfway between Ismailia and Suez.<br/>
<br/>
Ismailia is one of the cleanest and dullest <span style="color: #ff0000;">towns<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
