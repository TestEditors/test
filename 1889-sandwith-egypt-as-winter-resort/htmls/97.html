station. Mr. Petrie has now opened this Pyramid<br/>
also, and has cleared its temple, which is half a<br/>
mile to the east. Fragments of this temple are<br/>
now in England, dating from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Usertasen </span>II. of the<br/>
Twelfth Dynasty. One of the most interesting<br/>
discoveries is that the town of the builders of this<br/>
Pyramid joins the temple on the north, and here<br/>
may be seen rows of houses for workmen and for<br/>
stores, and numerous flint instruments lying<br/>
about. Many papyri and tools were found, and<br/>
pottery with Cypriote letters on it, thus proving<br/>
the early date of the Cypriote alphabet. There<br/>
is plenty of pottery of the Twelfth Dynasty lying<br/>
about; and to the west and south of the Pyramid<br/>
is a cemetery which was originally used by the<br/>
Twelfth Dynasty, and later used again from the<br/>
Twenty-first to the Twenty-sixth. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ear </span>the temple<br/>

end of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Illahun </span>dyke, which originally dated<br/>
from the Twelfth Dynasty, but has since shifted<br/>
its position. Here there is a town of the Nineteenth<br/>
Dynasty, built over the ruins of a temple of<br/>
Thothmes <span style="color: #0000FF;">TIL</span>, and from here much Greek pottery<br/>
of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mycena </span>type, with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cypriots </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phoenician<br/>
