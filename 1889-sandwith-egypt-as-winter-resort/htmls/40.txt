moon <span style="color: #0000FF;">only'four-fifths </span>of the street-lamps need be<br/>
lighted. When there is <span style="color: #0000FF;">no </span>moon, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">star-Spangled<br/>
</span>sky is a real treat, for the cloudy nights are few<br/>
and far between, and the flat roofs of the houses<br/>
easily lend themselves to the studies of amateur<br/>
astronomers. Among the stars which can be seen<br/>
in Cairo, but not in the latitudes of London,<br/>
Boston, or Philadelphia, are Canopus and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horologium </span>at the beginning of the year; while the<br/>
Southern Cross shows about two-thirds of its<br/>
height in May and June, though the foot of the<br/>
cross cannot be seen till one goes south of Assouan. Ara and the Centaur are well seen in<br/>
July, and the whole of the Scorpion shows to perfection; also at the close of the year we have the<br/>
Crane and the Phoenix. The Milky Way is always<br/>
beautiful, and the study of the stars has a special<br/>
attraction in a country where one can become<br/>
familiar with the original Arabic names still used<br/>
by all those who have acquired the knowledge of<br/>
the named stars.<br/>
<br/>
It may be remembered that the march on <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-elKebir</span>, in 1882, before dawn, was steered by the<br/>
stars, the English brigadiers being ordered to<br/>
march on Arcturus.<br/>
