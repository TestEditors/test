<span>72 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER <span style="color: #0000FF;">T.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">EXCURSIONS </span>FROM CAIRO.<br/>
<br/>
I HAVE already said that the favourite ride or drive<br/>
is in the direction of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghezireh</span>, where on Fridays<br/>
and Sundays there is always a crush of carriages;<br/>
but those who love peace will be happier on the<br/>
roads leading to the Pyramids, or Heliopolis, or<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Shoobra</span>, all soft, good roads, well shaded by the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">sycamore</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fig </span>or other trees.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Desert</span>--<span style="color: #ff0000;">For </span>visitors who can ride a great treat<br/>
is in store. The desert can be reached on all sides<br/>
most easily, and supplies a capital galloping<br/>
ground and invigorating air which seems to put<br/>
fresh life into both horse and rider. The popular<br/>
idea in England is that <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>desert is always one<br/>
vast plain of dazzling sand without undulations<br/>
and without signs of life, and that at every step<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">luckless </span>traveller must sink ankle-deep in<br/>
tiring sand. The reality is a series of hills and<br/>
valleys with innumerable changes of colour, and<br/>
of lights and shades, and a crisp, firm ground <span style="color: #0000FF;">upon<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
