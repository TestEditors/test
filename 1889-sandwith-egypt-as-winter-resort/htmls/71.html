</span>Most of the ice bought in Cairo is made from<br/>
the filtered water by the Water Company.<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Scavenging.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Before </span>1885 it was only the streets<br/>
of the European quarters that were cleaned, and<br/>
this work was done at shameful expense by a contractor employed by the Governor of Cairo. Now<br/>
the work is well done by the Sanitary Department<br/>
all over the town, and at a less cost than before.<br/>
All streets are kept swept, the made roads are<br/>
watered by carts every day, and the narrow lanes in<br/>
the native quarters are watered by the inhabitants<br/>
with goat-skins. Up till 7 <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the householders<br/>
are allowed to deposit in the street in heaps their<br/>
dry refuse, which is collected in carts, and either<br/>
burnt in the Turkish baths or shot outside the<br/>
town. This successfully prevents all the dust-bin<br/>
nuisances, and is very important in an Oriental<br/>
country where women and children seldom leave<br/>
the house, and are unprovided in the poorest cases<br/>
with water-closets.<br/>

have nothing but earth-closets in their houses;<br/>
others have, during my own sanitary knowledge<br/>
of the country, established cemented <span style="color: #0000FF;">cesspools</span>,<br/>
which are carefully trapped and ventilated, and<br/>
from which the faecal matter and urine are removed<br/>
by an <span style="color: #0000FF;">odourless </span>pneumatic system (Tallard) by<br/>
night. To this category belong all the hotels <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
