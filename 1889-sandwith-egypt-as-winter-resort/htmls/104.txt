<span>88 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
But, though I give an analysis of all three kinds<br/>
of waters, the only important one at present is the<br/>
sulphur variety. It owes its sulphur properties<br/>
to the chemical processes which sulphate of lime,<br/>
meeting with nitrogenous matter and becoming<br/>
sulphate of calcium, produces by setting free<br/>
carbonic acid and nitrogen from the decomposition<br/>
of the nitrogenous matter. Then the carbonic acid<br/>
decomposes the sulphate of calcium and forms<br/>
carbonate of lime, which, in presence of an excess<br/>
of carbonic acid and under great pressure, is converted into a very soluble bicarbonate of lime,<br/>
which at last sets free sulphuretted hydrogen gas.<br/>
The nitrogenous organic matter which is found<br/>
in all the Helouan waters has been named <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barégine</span>,<br/>
because it was first discovered in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baréges<br/>
</span>waters of the Pyrenees. It is found in all sulphur<br/>
waters when exposed to light and air, and is the<br/>
cause of the greenish vegetation which collects<br/>
round the edges of stagnant sulphur water. The<br/>
sulphur is sufficiently strong in the air to turn<br/>
silver ornaments black, but after the first day one<br/>
ceases to notice the odour.<br/>
