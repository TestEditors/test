<br/>
It ought, of course, to be connected with Cairo by<br/>
the railway, but this is strenuously objected to by<br/>
those interested in the welfare of Alexandria.<br/>
Visitors must either go half through the Canal<br/>
and disembark at Ismailia, or alight from their<br/>
steamer at Port Said into a small postal boat,<br/>
which will carry them and their luggage to<br/>
Ismailia in time to catch the train for Cairo.<br/>
Port Said has a very small English colony, but<br/>
possesses two English doctors, one in charge<br/>
of the native hospital, the other living at the<br/>
English hospital founded by Lady Strangford.<br/>
The three hotels are not first class, but the<br/>
traveller must often be dependent on one of them<br/>
in making the journey from Cairo to the Holy<br/>
Land. Meteorological observations are made at<br/>
Port Said, Ismailia, and Suez by the Canal<br/>
Company for transmission to Paris, but, as none<br/>
of the towns can be considered a health-resort, it<br/>
is unnecessary to quote them here.<br/>

<br/>
There is no prettier spot in Egypt than this<br/>
little wayside town of 3500 inhabitants, most of<br/>
whom are French and natives, and connected with<br/>
the Canal Company and its works. There are two<br/>
hotels, sometimes quite empty, and at other times<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
