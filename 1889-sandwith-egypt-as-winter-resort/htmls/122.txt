<span>106 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/>
<br/>
CHAPTER <span style="color: #0000FF;">WI</span>.<br/>
VOYAGE UP THE NILE.<br/>
<br/>
THE traveller who <span style="color: #ff0000;">Wishes </span>to visit Luxor, Thebes,<br/>
Philae, or Abu Simbel, is dependent upon the great<br/>
water-way of Egypt. He may go up all the way<br/>
by steamer or by dahabiyeh, or he may, if he<br/>
chooses, save himself 230 miles by taking the train<br/>
from Cairo to Assiout. In 1891, the Upper Egypt<br/>
railway will have a station in Cairo itself, and will<br/>
be pushed on to Girgeh, ninety-two miles south,<br/>
so that patients will be able to leave Cairo one<br/>
morning and sleep in Luxor the second night. But<br/>
at present we are dependent on a railway station<br/>
three miles outside Cairo, and a tiresome dusty<br/>
journey of eleven hours is necessary to reach<br/>
Assiout. Moreover, the invalid has the double<br/>
disadvantage of starting from Cairo before the day<br/>
is warmed by the sun, and of reaching Assiout<br/>
after sunset. On the other hand, he has the<br/>
advantage of getting without delay into the warmer<br/>
latitude, and of escaping all risk of cold <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
<br/>
