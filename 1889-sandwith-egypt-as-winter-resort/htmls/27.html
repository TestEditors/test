obliged to traverse the Suez Canal by night, and<br/>
then be put ashore uncomfortably in a boat in the<br/>

Alexandria to Cairo in three and three-quarter<br/>
hours, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>from Ismailia to Cairo there is only<br/>
one passenger train in the day, occupying four and<br/>
three-quarter hours. At neither port is there any<br/>
custom-house difficulty for personal baggage, and<br/>

Proposed <span style="color: #0000FF;">itinerary-Delicate </span>patients should<br/>
leave Europe at the middle or end of October, so<br/>
as to arrive in Cairo early in November. Some<br/>
remain in Cairo all the winter; others go up the<br/>
Nile to Luxor in December or January, and return<br/>
to Cairo at the end of February. In April they<br/>
should go to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramleh</span>, and thence perhaps to Italy<br/>
and the south of France, arranging not to reach<br/>
England or other cold climates till the very end of<br/>
May<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
