<span>70 Egypt as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Resort.<br/>
<br/>
Visitors interested in Oriental education will like<br/>
to see the Polytechnic School, that of the Arts and<br/>
Sciences, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>charity for the deaf, dumb, and blind, and<br/>
the useful work started by the late Miss Whately.<br/>
<br/>
The ordinary visitor demands at once to be<br/>
taken to see the howling and dancing dervishes,<br/>
and there are many other more interesting sects<br/>
whose monasteries he may <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit </span>if he will. Perhaps<br/>
one <span style="color: #ff0000;">maybe </span>forgiven for reminding him that their<br/>
fantastic worship plays to the Mussulman religion<br/>
a part something analogous to the Salvation Army<br/>
section of the Protestant Church.<br/>
<br/>
But whether the traveller comes for days, weeks,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>months, let us impress upon him the absolute<br/>
duty of <span style="color: #0000FF;">visiting </span>Boulak Museum, and of not neglecting his chance of seeing monuments as old as<br/>
the Pyramids, wooden statues of much the same<br/>
date, a unique assembly of royal mummies and<br/>
portraits painted years before the Old Masters.<br/>
The great objection to the museum is that most of<br/>
the objects are not labelled, and that the catalogue<br/>
is atrociously bad. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>may see there the jewellery<br/>
worn by an Egyptian queen three thousand six<br/>
hundred years ago, a trilingual inscription not<br/>
unlike the "Rosetta stone," and tables of kings<br/>
like the famous slab from Abydos. The museum<br/>
is better than any in Europe, and is rich especially<br/>
in monuments of the earliest Dynasties<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
