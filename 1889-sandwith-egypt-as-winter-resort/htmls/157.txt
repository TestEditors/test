<br/>
</span>from Heliopolis did indeed mark the site of the<br/>
Temple where honours were paid to dead and<br/>
living <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caesars</span>, and where <span style="color: #0000FF;">to-day </span>the British consul<br/>
has his modern house; but, as every one knows,<br/>
they were carried away to lose their hieroglyphics<br/>
in the ungenial climates of London and New York.<br/>
The very tomb of the great Alexander is lost to us,<br/>
and has almost inspired Dr. Schliemann to a<br/>
search-expedition for the mausoleum of the Ptolemies. Pompey's Pillar, as it is erroneously called,<br/>
is only interesting to us because it is the sole relic<br/>
of the city where Antony wooed Cleopatra, and of<br/>
the time when Alexandria was the commercial<br/>
centre of the world, and Egypt was the principal<br/>
granary of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Home</span>.<br/>
<br/>
There are now only about fifteen cisterns in the<br/>
town, though in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1869 </span>there were ten times that<br/>
number to be seen. This is only an illustration of<br/>
the destruction which has visited the city under<br/>
Arab, Turkish, and Egyptian rulers. These cisterns<br/>
are large, built under the houses, arched, and<br/>
coated with plaster.<br/>
<br/>
Next in interest are the Catacombs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>remains<br/>
of the ancient Necropolis, once upon a time surrounded by vineyards and gardens. They are cut<br/>
in the calcareous rock facing the sea, between<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Gabarri </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mes</span>, and an early Christian church,<br/>
best visited by boat, is hewn out of the rock <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/>
<br/>
