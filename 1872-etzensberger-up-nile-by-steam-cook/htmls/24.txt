<span style="color: #ff0000;">=-=_= </span>to a visit to the Kings' Tombs. Starting early in the<br/>
morning across the stream by boat, where donkeys <span style="color: #0000FF;">have<br/>
</span>already been conveyed by the same means, in about an<br/>
hour we arrive at the Temple-palace of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kournah</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">after<br/>
</span>having visited it, continue our journey through the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desolate<br/>

in the entrance of Tomb No. <span style="color: #0000FF;">ti</span>, those who like to walk can<br/>
go over the mountain chain, and come down near <span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Memmonium </span>or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rameenm</span>; the others return by the same<br/>
way they came, and a halt is made at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memmonium</span>.<br/>
On the way back to Luxor the ruins of the Temple of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Amunoph </span>II. and the sitting <span style="color: #0000FF;">Colossi </span>are visited.<br/>

partly over the same ground as the day before; we visit<br/>

lunch make an excursion to one of the most interesting<br/>
private Tombs, No. 35, called "<span style="color: #0000FF;">Dayr-el-Medinet</span>," situated<br/>
on <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>hill behind the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memmonium</span>. Close by are the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Priests'<br/>
</span>Tombs, the largest of which may be visited (although it is<br/>
scarcely worth the trouble) by those who are not easily<br/>
frightened by bats and rather rough and dangerous <span style="color: #0000FF;">passages</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A second stay is made afterwards at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Memmonium</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
