<span>FOR THE EAST. <span style="color: #0000FF;">61<br/>
<br/>
</span>The mountain range of Carmel is <span style="color: #ff0000;">fall </span>in view, and the extensive plain through which we pass bears excellent crops<br/>
of grain. We pass DOTHAN, where Joseph was sold by<br/>
his brethren, and at night <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamp </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ENIN</span>, near the<br/>
entrance to the field of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Esdraelon</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, the FOURTEENTH DAY, we cross the plains of<br/>
Esdraelon and Jezreel, see the Fountains of Jezreel and<br/>
Gideon; lunch at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Shunem</span>, under the lemon trees, pass on<br/>
our right Mount Tabor, see in the distance the villages of<br/>
Nain and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Endcr</span>, and then ascend the steep path of the<br/>
hills of Galilee, until we come within sight of <span style="color: #ff0000;">beautifullysituated </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">NAZARETII</span>. This is a charming place for Sabbath<br/>
repose, and it is rendered the more <span style="color: #0000FF;">interesting </span>to British<br/>
Christians by the erection of a beautiful little church,<br/>
where English worship is conducted. There are two<br/>
churches of the Annunciation, one at each end of the<br/>
village, the Greeks claiming one spot and the Latins<br/>
another as the place where the angel appeared to Mary.<br/>
Other legends abound here, and the modern water-bearers<br/>
attract much attention.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">FIFTEENTH </span>DAY, being spent at Nazareth, on<br/>
<br/>
Monday, the SIXTEENTH DAY, we proceed over the hills<br/>
and through the plains of Galilee, to the Lake of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Genessaret</span>,<br/>
the Lake of Tiberias, or the Sea of Galilee, by whatever<br/>
name this principal lake of Palestine is called. Here we<br/>
prepare to spend two days, as it is notably one of the<br/>
loveliest spots in the country, and, historically, no other<br/>
place in Palestine excels it in interest. We therefore stay<br/>
here over Tuesday, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">SEVENTEENTII </span>DAY, and strike our<br/>
tents again on<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">EIGHTEENTII </span>DAY, and travel to the plain<br/>
by the waters of Merom, where we <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamp </span>for the night on<br/>
an island, between two running streams, fed by the famous<br/>
fountains of Ain <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mallahah</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">NINETEENTH </span>DAY, we ride round the head<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the extensive plain; and lunch at Dan, near one of the<br/>
chief sources of the J <span style="color: #0000FF;">ordan</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>Afterwards travel through<br/>
what might have been an ancient park to the second source<br/>
of the J <span style="color: #0000FF;">ordan</span>, at BANIAS, the ancient Caesarea Philippi<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
