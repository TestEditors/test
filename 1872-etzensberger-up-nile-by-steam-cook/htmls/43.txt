<span>38 TOURIST PROGRAMMES<br/>
<br/>
projected Tour to Palestine, at a cost of about <span style="color: #0000FF;">2200</span>. But<br/>
I cannot remember the details, nor the comprehension of<br/>
the scheme, nor do I know what came of it.<br/>
<br/>
I believe it is now <span style="color: #ff0000;">twenty-ihree </span>years since I met, in one<br/>
of my Highland Tours, a distinguished English clergyman,<br/>
who first led me to think of the matter seriously, and from<br/>
that time, however silently the <span style="color: #0000FF;">idea </span>slept under the heavy<br/>
load of other engagements, I had always anticipated that<br/>
it must be done at some convenient <span style="color: #0000FF;">season</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">C </span>Under that<br/>
impression I made a special journey from Leicester to<br/>
London, in 1850, to see the late J AMES SILK BUCKINGHAM,<br/>
the famous Oriental traveller, from whom I received much<br/>
valuable information and advice.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Buckingham was just the man to <span style="color: #ff0000;">sympathise </span>with<br/>
a movement for bringing together people of<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>various<br/>
nationalities and social distinctions, and he entered warmly<br/>
into my project.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards the subject was frequently mooted, and once<br/>
in particular, on the granite rocks at the Land's End, a<br/>
social gathering of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Excursionists </span>assembled to talk over<br/>
matters of travelling interest. On <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">occasion </span>my <span style="color: #ff0000;">everconstant </span>friend, Mr. ALDERMAN CULLEN, of Nottingham,<br/>
expressed his strong conviction that, having reached the<br/>
"End" of English soil, I should, ere long, conduct my<br/>
patrons to the Holy Land. I thought so too, in my inmost<br/>
heart, but dared not to express the hope. My great <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>then was isolation in my work, and the impossibility<br/>
of leaving home for so long a period as 70 or 80 days.<br/>
But in 1864 my Son came back to my assistance, and I<br/>
then <span style="color: #0000FF;">felt </span>at liberty to look both East and West, and my<br/>
plans were developed in 1865, when I announced a Tour<br/>
to America for the coming spring, and my purpose of<br/>
making an Eastern arrangement for the termination of<br/>
1866.<br/>
<br/>
I started for the United States in November, 1865, travelled from New York to Montreal, Niagara, Detroit,<br/>
Chicago, Wisconsin, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, and other places, about 4000 miles<br/>
from New York, and over all the Lines I made special provision for Circular Tickets, at uniform rates. My Son left<br/>
England in May, 1866, with a Party of about 30, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">test<br/>
