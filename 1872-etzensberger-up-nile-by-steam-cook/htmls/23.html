</span>and dancing girls<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Another great curiosity is the native gentleman, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>Consul who represented France and Prussia simultaneously<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">during</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the late war, and may still do so; this dignitary,<br/>
who, by-the-bye, does not speak a single word of any<br/>
European language, is very fond of receiving homage from<br/>
visitors, and on our last visit graciously bowed and shook<br/>
hands with all, while his interpreter gravely <span style="color: #0000FF;">repeated </span>--" His<br/>
Excellency the Consul of France," and his ditto of Prussia.<br/>
His coffee, however, was excellent, and we looked <span style="color: #0000FF;">very<br/>

</span>8th <span style="color: #0000FF;">day.-1n </span>the morning passengers are conveyed in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">TE</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_____ </span>boats across the river, where donkeys are waiting to take us<br/>
to the Temple of Dandarah, about one hour's ride. This<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Er</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>is the first imposing monument met <span style="color: #0000FF;">with</span>, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">impress<br/>
</span>sion it produces at first sight is never to be forgotten. <span style="color: #ff0000;">It<br/>
</span>is rather puzzling in the beginning to find <span style="color: #ff0000;">one'g </span>way through<br/>
the halls and through the heaps of ruins surrounding the<br/>
walls, and discover the site of any given point. As the<br/>
Temples, however, were nearly all built very much on the<br/>
same plan, a little practice will soon facilitate researches.<br/>
<br/>
What is still missing in any existing guide book, is a<br/>
simple plan of every important monument, <span style="color: #ff0000;">pointing </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">out</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">;<br/>
</span>the places to be particularly visited, and referring to the<br/>
corresponding pages in the book.<br/>
<br/>
If the visit to Dandarah is finished by noon, the boat may<br/>
reach Luxor the same evening, and anchor opposite the<br/>
Temple of Luxor, the portico of which is occupied by the<br/>
office of Mustapha Agar, the well-known and <span style="color: #ff0000;">frequentlymentioned </span>English and American Consul. He <span style="color: #0000FF;">speaks<br/>
