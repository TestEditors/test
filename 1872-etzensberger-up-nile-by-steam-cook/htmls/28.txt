<span style="color: #ff0000;">_. </span>especially, have acquired the greatest perfection; they all<br/>
speak a little English, and try to move your heart by the<br/>
most lamentable stories. They have either lost their father<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">l </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>or mother, and have no place to sleep in; or they show<br/>
you a broken vessel, crying bitterly that they dare not<br/>
return home for fear of being beaten<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>When on the down journey the boat stops in any place<br/>
which is not marked in the itinerary as a regular stopping<br/>
place, or touches twice at the same station, passengers <span style="color: #0000FF;">who<br/>
</span>want donkeys to visit these places <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>second time must <span style="color: #0000FF;">pay<br/>
</span>for the donkeys <span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the same applies to <span style="color: #0000FF;">night </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Excursions</span>, visiting Karnak, or any other place, by moonlight,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">E</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>or going to Fantasies.<br/>

impossible for them to ride to the more distant places;<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Ill </span>gentlemen also, who cannot rough it a little, ought to <span style="color: #0000FF;">provide </span>a donkey saddle at Cairo, or at least a pair of stirrups<br/>
and a bridle for the two Excursions at Beni-Hassan and<br/>
to Abydos, where the donkey <span style="color: #0000FF;">accoutrements </span>are very<br/>
wretched.<br/>
<br/>
We shall try in the coming season to remedy all this as<br/>
much as possible, but cannot take any responsibility in this<br/>
respect, and can only provide what the country offers. This<br/>
three weeks' Excursion on the Nile, and life on board a ship,<br/>
is generally quite long enough for any one, and it is with<br/>
great delight that the view of the citadel and minarets of<br/>
Cairo is hailed. A gentleman passenger last season expressed his feelings very properly in saying that to do all<br/>
the work and sight-seeing up the N ile, and then to float<br/>
idly down, was just like reading a highly interesting book,<br/>
and when finished, turning its leaves once more <span style="color: #0000FF;">leisurely<br/>
