UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">DAHABEAHS </span>AND <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">BTEAMERS</span>.<br/>
<br/>
NOTHING has probably been so fully described and <span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">praised<br/>
</span>to exhaustion as the famous "<span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Dahabeah</span><span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">;</span>" and the idyllic<br/>
charms of life in one of these boats, <span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">floating </span>up and down<br/>
the Nile, have been sung in every imaginable strain. No<br/>
doubt, for a party of very dear friends on a shooting excursion, a young couple in their honeymoon, <span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">invalids </span>in<br/>
search of health, young swells who have nothing <span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">at </span>all to<br/>
do on earth but kill time and throw away their money-in<br/>
fact, for any one who can easily shut himself <span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">out </span>from all<br/>
communication with the civilized world, and has got the<br/>
temper to lie idle for weeks and months, looking every day<br/>
on the same uniformly desolate scenery, nothing can be<br/>
more delicious: besides, it is "the Fashion." Who would<br/>
dare to confess, in good society, to having been up the Nile,<br/>
except by <span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">Dahabeah</span>?<br/>
<br/>
Such small drawbacks <span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">as </span>sudden severe illness, accidents<br/>
from fire-arms, and consequent helplessness of the <span style="color: #ff0000;" data-mce-style="color: #ff0000;">travellerts-no </span>medical aid being obtainable-even deaths on<br/>
board, occurring every season, are never even mentioned<span style="color: #0000ff;" data-mce-style="color: #0000ff;">;<br/>
