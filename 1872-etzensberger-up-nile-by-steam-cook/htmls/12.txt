<span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>and can be relied upon, so that telegraphic messages<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">______ </span>can be received and forwarded nearly every day through<br/>
our <span style="color: #ff0000;">Offiee </span>in Cairo. The calculation of time employed <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
</span>easy and certain<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and the date of return can be fixed beforehand, so that ulterior <span style="color: #0000FF;">travelling </span>arrangements can be <span style="color: #0000FF;">made<br/>
</span>with safety. In a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dahabeah</span>, one may return <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>weeks<br/>
or three months, according to wind and other <span style="color: #0000FF;">circumstances</span>; the <span style="color: #0000FF;">defective </span>postal arrangements make it very<br/>

OUTFIT AND CHOICE OF ROUTES.<br/>

In direct opposition to all existing guide books and their<br/>
stereotyped instructions, <span style="color: #0000FF;">cautioning </span>travellers to encumber<br/>
themselves with a hundred useless articles they never want,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>say: Come out to Egypt and on the Nile just as you<br/>
would travel and are accustomed to travel anywhere else <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
