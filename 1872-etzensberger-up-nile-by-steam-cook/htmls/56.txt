The foregoing charges have especial reference to Autumnal<br/>
Arrangements, and to small Parties at any time who prefer<br/>
to go out independent of personal supervision.<br/>
<br/>
For Parties starting in January or February, when the<br/>
numbers may be expected to be larger, special provision can<br/>
be made; and for Parties of Twenty <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>upwards the charges<br/>
will be about <span style="color: #0000FF;">Â£10 </span>less than the lowest of the above scale.<br/>
To terminate all trouble or uncertainty to the Travellers<br/>
about incidentals, Messrs. Cook and Son will in future<br/>
include all, except Drinks and English Saddles, the use of<br/>
latter costing about SI for the month; and instead of<br/>
quoting, as heretofore, the Fares at 110 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Guineas </span>(S115 los.),<br/>
they will engage to provide for all, with the above exceptions,<br/>
for<br/>
<br/>
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY POUNDS.<br/>
<br/>
That sum to include Omnibuses, Porterage, Luggage,<br/>
Registration, Landings and Embarkation, where necessary;<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Backshee.sh </span>to Camp <span style="color: #0000FF;">Servants</span>, Gratuities to Steamboat<br/>
Stewards and other Servants' in a word, all that is necessary to be paid everywhere, except, as before stated, for<br/>
Drinks and English Saddles, <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>are matters of choice<br/>
and taste. Syrian Saddles are provided by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Muleteers<br/>
</span>free of cost, but they are sometimes so inconvenient that<br/>
many prefer to pay a pound extra for an English Saddle,<br/>
and others take Saddles with them. The limit of the<br/>
weight of luggage to be paid for by the Contractors cannot<br/>
exceed <span style="color: #0000FF;">60 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lbs</span>. If more is taken, all above that weight<br/>
must be paid for as an extra. The class of <span style="color: #0000FF;">incidentals </span>can<br/>
only be covered so long as the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tourists </span>travel with the<br/>
Conductor, and he has command of the expenses. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bis<br/>
