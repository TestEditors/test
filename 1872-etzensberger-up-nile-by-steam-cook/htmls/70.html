views of <span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span>may be met who think a month too little,<br/>
and the course indicated above too hurried. But such<br/>
extension must necessarily cost about <span style="color: #0000FF;">£20</span>, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">addition </span>to<br/>
the Fares quoted above. An abridgment in the centre of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>the Tour could not be so conveniently made, as the Dragoman must necessarily take horses, baggage mules, and<br/>
tent equipments forward to Damascus<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and for this reason<br/>
the reduction could not be in equal proportion to the<br/>
general cost of the Palestine Tour.<br/>

CAUTIONARY PROVISO.<br/>
<br/>
We have arranged our Fares on a broad and liberal<br/>
margin; but there may arise in Tours of 30 to over 80<br/>
days, and extending to 6,000 or 7,000 miles, many <span style="color: #0000FF;">unavoidable </span>causes of detention or breaches of arrangement, and<br/>
it is against such incidents, altogether beyond human<br/>
control, that we have to be on our guard. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Quarantine </span>is a<br/>
frightful thing when once established in Eastern ports, and<br/>
by that all our plans might be <span style="color: #0000FF;">disarranged</span>, and additional<br/>
expenses be added to loss of time. Hitherto we have been<br/>
singularly fortunate at J <span style="color: #0000FF;">affa</span>, always being able to land and<br/>
re-embark without difficulty; but our <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dragomans </span>were, in<br/>
February, 1871, driven from J affa to Port Said with almost<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">ship-load </span>of camp equipments and servants, incurring a<br/>
loss of over <span style="color: #0000FF;">£50</span>, which they had to sustain. Passengers<br/>
must not expect always to escape such losses; and, were<br/>
