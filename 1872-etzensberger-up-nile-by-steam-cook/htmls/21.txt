<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>18 UP THE NILE BY <span style="color: #0000FF;">STEAM</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>generally visited from Cairo, donkeys being sent on <span style="color: #0000FF;">during<br/>
</span>the night, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">taken'along </span>in the trains, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">Steamers </span>on<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ill </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">4</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>their way up do not stop here for sight-seeing. If, on the<br/>
return journey, the Steamer stops here during the last night<br/>
or arrives early in the morning, passengers who are good<br/>
walkers may leave her and visit those places, taking care<br/>
to be back in time at the railway station for the only down<br/>
train, due at 4 p.m., and generally coming on between that<br/>
hour and 8 or o pm. As the Steamer has to proceed at<br/>
once back to Cairo, baggage can be left on board and<br/>
claimed afterwards at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Office</span>, or may be entrusted to<br/>
one of the servants for conveyance to an Hotel.<br/>
<br/>
2nd <span style="color: #0000FF;">tlay-Towards </span>evening <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benigouiif </span>is reached; in<br/>
N <span style="color: #ff0000;">ovember </span>and December, when the river is high, Steamers<br/>
can get close to the place, and in that case a stroll through<br/>
this dirty, uninteresting <span style="color: #0000FF;">spot </span>may be made; during the<br/>
rest of the season the water is too shallow, and Steamers<br/>
must lay off at a distance of about two miles; but the<br/>
place is not worth the trouble of so long a walk.<br/>
<br/>
If the night is clear and <span style="color: #ff0000;">moon-lit</span>, the Steamer continues<br/>
its course for a few hours longer, and possibly reaches <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bib√©</span>,<br/>
where a fine palm grove invites ashore.<br/>
<br/>
3rd day-In the afternoon we pass "( <span style="color: #ff0000;">hsbe1-el-Dayr</span>," on<br/>
the top of which stands a Coptic convent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span>inmates<br/>
plunge into the river as soon <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>a boat is in sight, and<br/>
swimming towards it, with great dexterity catch hold of the<br/>
small boat in tow, get into it, and climb on deck to ask<br/>
for <span style="color: #ff0000;">i5acksheesh</span>. Ladies had better retire to the saloon<br/>
during this visit. Towards evening Minyeh is reached; it<br/>
contains a fine palace belonging to the Viceroy, who generally spends a few weeks here in the winter; and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">most<br/>
