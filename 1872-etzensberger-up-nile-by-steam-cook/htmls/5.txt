Of course all these publications are only destined for those<br/>
few who can afford the time and money to hire a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dahabeah</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>and idle away three months; nobody ever thought it <span style="color: #0000FF;">worth<br/>

Nile. It is for this great majority, representing at least<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nine-tenths </span>of the actually travelling public, that these<br/>
pages, the result of personal observation during two seasons,<br/>
have been written, and it is sincerely hoped that their<br/>
perusal will disperse many false and exaggerated notions,<br/>
and smooth the way for intending <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tourists<br/>
