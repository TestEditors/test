<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span>FOR THE EAST. 39<br/>
<br/>
the plans I had formed and the arrangements made. <span style="color: #ff0000;">All<br/>
</span>seemed to wear a promising aspect until American Ocean<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_______ </span>Steamboat and Railroad Ticket Agents fired up in <span style="color: #0000FF;">opposition </span>and strewed our path with <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulties</span>, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>we<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>had eventually to succumb, after <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>second visit of my Son<br/>
to consolidate arrangements.<br/>
<br/>
At the close of <span style="color: #ff0000;">18</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">% </span>I foresaw <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>busy season in Paris in<br/>
connection with the Universal Exhibition, and I suspended<br/>
all ideas of Eastern Travel until that season of great things<br/>
had closed. But no sooner had we got through <span style="color: #0000FF;">our </span>work<br/>
of taking visitors to, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">providing </span>them homes in, Paris,<br/>
than I again took up the idea of Tours to the East, and<br/>
wrote a page in my <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ezcursitvris/</span>, foreshadowing my plans<br/>
for the next year, the first feature of which was examination<br/>
of Routes, travelling and other accommodation. To make<br/>
myself sure on these points, I started in the following<br/>
September for Italy, and from thence went to Constantinople, and by the Syrian coast to Smyrna, Beyrout, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaffa</span>,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>to Egypt, calling at all chief points by the way, and<br/>
making the acquaintance of friends and helpers. At Constantinople I met with a talented friend, who for years had<br/>
been urging me to come out to the East with Tourist<br/>
Parties. At Beyrout I made the pleasant acquaintance of<br/>
the late Mrs. Thompson, the founder of the Beyrout and<br/>
Lebanon Schools, and her valuable <span style="color: #ff0000;">coadjntors</span>, Mr. and<br/>
Miss Motte. I also made Hotel and Dragoman <span style="color: #ff0000;">arrangemenfe</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and then proceeded to J affa, for the same purpose.<br/>
I <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>letters of introduction to several of the most <span style="color: #ff0000;">infinential </span>residents of Jerusalem, but I could not succeed<br/>
in getting there in the time I had at command. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">went<br/>
</span>on to Alexandria and Cairo, and there made arrangements<br/>
for Nile Tours, as well as for Palestine.<br/>
<br/>
I have been the more exact in detailing the particulars<br/>
of this preliminary journey, in consequence of public<br/>
insinuations and private accusations of having copied the<br/>
models of others, and especially of one claiming to be the<br/>
"Originator" of Eastern Tours. So far from this being a.<br/>
truthful representation, I refused to read a line of any<br/>
other programme or report of previous contracting arrangements, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>I refused to go to any Hotel where this<br/>
"Originator" had managed to enter before me. I did<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
