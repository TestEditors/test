<br/>
over, and lingering with delight on the most beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">passages</span>, have a last glimpse at them, and be very glad to have<br/>
done <span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>it<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The captains and crews are of course all natives, and<br/>
belong to the regular navy; discipline, however, is not very<br/>
strict on board, nor have the captains, who only speak<br/>
Arabic, any authority over their passengers, which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">sometimes </span>greatly to be regretted. They are, however, all very<br/>
modest and obliging men, and very much afraid of complaints being made against them on return; for this reason,<br/>
towards the end of the Tour, they manage to get a <span style="color: #0000FF;">certifieate </span>signed by all the passengers, expressing their <span style="color: #0000FF;">satisfaction</span>. If such a testimonial cannot be produced, or<br/>
complaints are made against them, they are fined, and part<br/>
of their pay, which is already poor enough, is withheld.<br/>
The following may be taken as an instance of the manner<br/>
in which they are dealt with. Last <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter </span>a large American<br/>
family party hired a Steamer on their own account, and, as<br/>
they were exceedingly pleased with the captain and crew,<br/>
large gratuities were given to them all. The Bey in command at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Boulak </span>knew this; and as one day during the<br/>
voyage burning Cinders <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>accidentally <span style="color: #0000FF;">fallen </span>from the<br/>
chimney on the awning, which was partially destroyed by<br/>
fire, and certainly was no fault of the captain's, the poor<br/>
fellow had to <span style="color: #ff0000;">gaerifice </span>his money and replace it by a new<br/>
one. On the same steamer the <span style="color: #0000FF;">steersmen</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>together<br/>
with the pilot, is really in charge of the whole ship, had run<br/>
her aground, as it can happen very easily in shallow water<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>and had to pay for <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>the damage done in breakage.<br/>
<br/>
It is, however, not only the natives who are thus summarily treated. One day last <span style="color: #0000FF;">sTring</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-it </span>was the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kh√©dire'a<br/>
