<span>FOR THE EAST. 47<br/>
<br/>
the great majority of Eastern travellers feel the need of<br/>
assistance. We have often been amused to see how close<br/>
small parties <span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>independents "kept to our large <span style="color: #0000FF;">encampments</span>, generally occupying ground within gun-shot of <span style="color: #0000FF;">us</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The fact is, a tolerably strong party is, for many reasons,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">.-.-..</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>best for Palestine. In management there is no more real<br/>
difficulty than for smaller numbers, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>proportionate<br/>
number of servants is engaged, and the work of striking<br/>
and pitching tents is done quite as expeditiously as for a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">W </span>small number. For a large party there are arrangements<br/>
to get the largest supplies <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the best food, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dra- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">goman </span>is in a better position to engage escorts and military<br/>
guards when they are required. It is a pleasant thing to<br/>
sit down at a "table in the wilderness," with a score or so<br/>
of congenial friends.<br/>
<br/>
But we are prepared for any number, from three to <span style="color: #0000FF;">threescore</span>, to be divided and sub-divided as they choose. Parties<br/>
of two or three will have to pay more than five, and five<br/>
more than ten; whilst for ten and all above, our terms will<br/>
be uniform, in the early months of the year. In the autumn<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>cannot command <span style="color: #0000FF;">numbers </span>to make the travelling as cheap<br/>
as in the early spring<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>ROUTES TO THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>The opening of new lines of railway, and changes in steam<br/>
navigation, <span style="color: #ff0000;">naturally </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">afftet </span>all our arrangements for travelling<br/>
to the East. It is to our interest, as well as to the interest<br/>
and comfort of travellers, to adhere to those Lines and<br/>
Companies which have previously proved most favourable<br/>
to our plans, and where we may reasonably <span style="color: #0000FF;">expect </span>the most<br/>
pleasant recognition.<br/>
<br/>
GOING TO ITALY there are about half-a-dozen Routes<br/>
available. We can go over the Alps by Railway or Diligence;<br/>
under the Alps by Mont <span style="color: #0000FF;">Genie </span>Tunnel; and as the Corniche<br/>
road is now open, we can get from Paris to Italy by Railway<br/>
without a break of <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey</span>, and without a seven miles tunnel<br/>
ride. The Trip through Italy may be made as a single<br/>
journey to Trieste or Brindisi, or a Circular Tour may be<br/>
made to include the chief cities in the country. This can<br/>
be arranged for either the outward or the return journey<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
