<span>8 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
less strongly felt, and of less consequence, on board a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Steamboat-being </span>a public means of conveyance, where<br/>
every passenger can keep aloof from or mix with whom he<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">likesr</span>--than on board a Dahabeah, where they all must form<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">______</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>one family party, living day and night in close proximity,<br/>
and where continual frictions are unavoidable. We repeat,<br/>
it is very bad when misunderstanding arises between <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>passengers on board a Steamer, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but-it </span>is ten times worse in<br/>
a Dahabeah, and why, if a confidential party is not formed<br/>
from the very beginning, <span style="color: #0000FF;">run </span>the risk of spending three<br/>
miserable months with disagreeable travelling companions<br/>
instead of so many weeks?<br/>
<br/>
Mutual forbearance, a little <span style="color: #ff0000;">11nselfhishnegg</span>, and easy<br/>
temper, can give <span style="color: #0000FF;">great </span>charms to this highly interesting<br/>
Tour; and any one travelling in the East, and especially on<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile</span>, ought to remember the country and place he is<br/>
in-that it is utterly impossible to get everything as easily<br/>
as in a civilized country; in short, he must make up his<br/>
mind to rough it a little every' now and then, and not<br/>
grumble on the least occasion; or he had much better stay<br/>
at home.<br/>
<br/>
The expenses of the Steamboat administration, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">diffieu1ty </span>of supplying coal and various kinds of provisions,<br/>
are very serious. The materiel actually disposable for the<br/>
passenger <span style="color: #ff0000;">traffie </span>on the Nile is certainly not what it could<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">ought </span>to be; but then we ought to be thankful even<br/>
for this, and consider that the Egyptian Government keep<br/>
up these passenger Steamers at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>great pecuniary loss, and<br/>
only for the sake and benefit of European Tourists.<br/>
<br/>
Besides, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Khedive </span>intends to improve this service<br/>
gradually, and one new comfortable Steamer has <span style="color: #0000FF;">already<br/>
<br/>
