27th or 28th of the same month; and allowing two or<br/>
three days for detention, there is good reason for <span style="color: #0000FF;">expecting<br/>
</span>to reach CAIRO by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">let </span>of February, ready to meet <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>First Party from England, <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">c.</span>, for the NILE TOUR.<br/>

DATES OF DEPARTURE FROM ENGLAND, THE<br/>
CONTINENT, AND THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
The arrangements of Messrs. COOK <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Sos </span>afford <span style="color: #0000FF;">facilities<br/>
</span>for a direct journey from London to TRIESTE or BRINDISI,<br/>
or for a previous Tour through Italy, going either by Paris<br/>
and Mont <span style="color: #0000FF;">Genie</span>, or by LYONS, MARSEILLES, CANNES, NICE,<br/>
MENTONE, SAN REMO, GENOA, & c.<br/>
<br/>
For any practicable route Tickets can be supplied at any<br/>
time, and any additional Hotel Coupons can be had to<br/>
cover the extra time', but for the Steamers of the Adriatic<br/>
and the Mediterranean, especially for the Syrian Coast <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>the Levant, it is necessary to fix the times and to adhere to<br/>
them. Provision is made for two principal Tours in the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ttet1ison</span>--the first to include the Nile and Palestine<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the<br/>
second, Palestine, <span style="color: #ff0000;">das.</span>, without the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>. But as these <span style="color: #0000FF;">two<br/>
