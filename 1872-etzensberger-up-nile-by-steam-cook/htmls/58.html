But for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dragoman'g </span>department it is necessary to say<br/>
in advance, whether the time required is two weeks, four<br/>
weeks, six weeks, or more. Allowance cannot be made for<br/>
abridgments of Tours in Palestine after the engagement<br/>
has once been made. <span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is easier to increase than to<br/>
abridge the time, as an engagement made for horses, mules,<br/>
servants, tents, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gee.</span>, cannot be broken by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dragoman</span>.<br/>
<br/>
It is also important for the Travellers to decide beforehand what route they will take from Palestine to Europe<span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>whether they wish to include or omit Constantinople, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or'<br/>
</span>Athens, or both, and which way they wish to return, <span style="color: #0000FF;">m'd<br/>
</span>Brindisi and through Southern and Central Italy, or by<br/>
Trieste and North Italy. Either of these routes can be<br/>
provided for by pre-arrangement; but the Fares above<br/>
quoted do not provide for a double <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey </span>through Italy,<br/>
between Brindisi, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Naples</span>, Rome, and the Alps. If any wish<br/>
both to go and return that way, they must pay <span style="color: #ff0000;">Â£2 </span>extra <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the Tickets.<br/>
<br/>
Any number <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>European Hotel Coupons above fifteen<br/>
days can be supplied at their advertised rates of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Te</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">6d</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>per day, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>without additional Supplements for extras,<br/>
which are sold in books of <span style="color: #0000FF;">los</span>. and 20s. each.<br/>
<br/>
FOR THE EAST, twenty days' Coupons are provided, as,<br/>
according to the advertised times of the Steamer sailings,<br/>
that number is <span style="color: #ff0000;">suificient </span>for the time allotted to the Tour,<br/>
which gives eight days to Lower Egypt, from Alexandria<br/>
to Cairo and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ismailia</span>; two days at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beyrout</span>; five days at<br/>
Constantinople; and five days at Athens. It is impossible<br/>
to foresee all contingencies that may arise in the East, and<br/>
that may cause detention or curtailment of time; but twenty<br/>
days is a fair calculation, and for that time only can the<br/>
Contractors for the Tours be responsible. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>neither<br/>
control 1101' be responsible for the irregularities of Steamboats.<br/>
It frequently happens <span style="color: #0000FF;">that </span>those who combine the Nile Trip<br/>
with Palestine are detained a day <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>two 011 the Nile,<br/>
especially when the water is low, and in those cases the<br/>
travellers gain the advantage of having surplus Coupons<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">tudricient </span>to cover the charges of wayside and occasional<br/>
refreshments, as Messrs. Cook & Son hold themselves<br/>
responsible for payment of Coupons for twenty days,<br/>
between the time of landing at Alexandria and <span style="color: #0000FF;">embarkation<br/>
