<span style="color: #0000FF;">From </span>Alexandria there is a Railway up to Cairo; <span style="color: #0000FF;">three<br/>
<br/>
</span>Trains run each day, in four hours by Express and six<br/>
hours by Ordinary Trains. Tickets to be obtained in<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">AN</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>London and Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The principal thing one must not <span style="color: #0000FF;">forget </span>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">money</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-travelling </span>in the East, and Hotel accommodation, <span style="color: #0000FF;">being<br/>
<br/>
</span>very expensive. English <span style="color: #0000FF;">circular </span>and bank notes <span style="color: #0000FF;">generally<br/>
<br/>
</span>lose 1 to 2 per cent. in exchange for gold' other notes <span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>current, nor can any payment be <span style="color: #0000FF;">made </span>except in specie<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>GUIDE BOOKS<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>These notes are not designed to supersede any of the<br/>
existing guide books, their only object being to give such<br/>
special information as is generally wanted and wished for<br/>
by intending Steamboat passengers. A few words may be<br/>
added here concerning this subject.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #ff0000;">WIrray</span>'s Handbook to Egypt," entirely out of print<br/>
last season, certainly deserves the first place for accuracy<br/>
and completeness; but experience has shown that the<br/>
perusal of it Will be more profitable and easier after a Nile<br/>
Tour than during and before it. The immense accumulation<br/>
of matter, the mention of several learned authorities, and<br/>
extracts from their different works about the same places<br/>
and monuments, bewilder and confuse at <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>sight. It <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
</span>very difficult to find the correct passage and description <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>a monument or part of a temple when standing in front of<br/>
it; a good deal of precious time is thus <span style="color: #ff0000;">lose </span>in researches,<br/>
and very often it has to be given up. Nor is there <span style="color: #0000FF;">much<br/>
<br/>
