<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">h</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>STEAMERS there are several lines available from Trieste<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>or Brindisi. Our connection with the Austrian Lloyds has<br/>
been most satisfactory, and for special Palestine parties we<br/>
wish to adhere to that Company as closely as possible; <span style="color: #0000FF;">hence<br/>
</span>our plans are laid and Fares calculated on the arrangements<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">___</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>of their Steamers from Trieste <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Brindisi and Corfu. We can<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_____ </span>give Tickets to start from either point, and if parties will go<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-=_77</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>by other routes, we shall deduct from the Fare the amount<br/>
that we should pay the Austrian Lloyds as far as Alexandria.<br/>
For the Syrian Coast no other Line affords <span style="color: #0000FF;">equal </span>facilities<br/>
for the various Levantine Ports; and for making the call<br/>
at Athens, the Austrian Lloyds are the most convenient<br/>
steamers. It is, therefore, to the mutual interest of Contractor and Passengers to do all we can for the Austrian<br/>
Lloyds Steamers. We offer the facility of starting any Friday<br/>
night from Trieste, or any Sunday from Corfu, for Alexandria,<br/>
by their accelerated Line, and we can supply Tickets for<br/>
their Steamers from Brindisi to Corfu, in connection <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
</span>Tickets from London to Brindisi, by any open road. In<br/>
returning we can supply Tickets for entering Italy at Venice<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Brindisi, or if any wish to go by any other route, from<br/>
Constantinople or Athens, we will provide Tickets for them,<br/>
or deduct an equitable proportion of the Fares, in accordance with the principle already stated.<br/>
<br/>
In EGYPT we have the Railways and the Suez Canal<br/>
Steamers at command, and all our Tickets for <span style="color: #ff0000;">Personallyconducted </span>Parties will include trips to the Pyramids.<br/>
