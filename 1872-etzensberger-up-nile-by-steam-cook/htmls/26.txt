<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>UP THE NILE BY <span style="color: #0000FF;">STEAM</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">23<br/>
<br/>
</span>here in about <span style="color: #ff0000;">five </span>hours: as soon as the Steamer <span style="color: #0000FF;">steps</span>, a<br/>
swarm of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nubionseome </span>to offer ostrich feathers, eggs, and<br/>
other articles, for sale.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">14</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">% </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">dar-M </span>Assuan. Early after breakfast donkeys or<br/>
camels, at choice, are waiting to carry us through the town<br/>
and bazaar of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Assuan</span>, and the cemetery, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desert </span>road<br/>
leading towards <span style="color: #0000FF;">Philos </span>About a mile from the town, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>the hills to the left, are the celebrated granite quarries<br/>
where the obelisks were extracted from, and which are<br/>
best visited now. Continuing our road afterwards, in <span style="color: #0000FF;">about<br/>
</span>one hour we arrive on the river, where a boat is <span style="color: #0000FF;">waiting </span>to<br/>
convey us over to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Phila</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:</span>. Until about 3 <span style="color: #0000FF;">o'clock </span>in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">afternoon </span>there is sufficient time to visit this enchanting place<br/>
in every <span style="color: #ff0000;">part</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">h1neh</span>, and rest; then we once more go <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span>board the boat, either to take us back to the place where <span style="color: #ff0000;">weembarked</span>, or, if the wind permits and the company have<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'__</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>made arrangements, to shoot the Cataracts in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dahabeah<br/>
</span>(which is at their own expense and risk); the same boat<br/>
brings us to our Steamer at Assuan in about two hours.<br/>
The charge for a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Dahabeah </span>for a party to shoot the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Catsraets </span>is from £5 to <span style="color: #ff0000;">£8 </span>sterling. If the wind is contrary,<br/>
or no arrangement has been made for shooting the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cuteracts</span>, then we again mount our donkeys or <span style="color: #0000FF;">camels-the<br/>
</span>latter operation being rather dangerous-and return to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan </span>by another road, striking to the left towards the<br/>
village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mohattan</span>, and coasting the river all the way<br/>
down, enjoying the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">magnificent </span>and varied views of<br/>
the wild scenery. As a rule, guides and donkey boys do<br/>
not like to take this way back, but the interest it <span style="color: #0000FF;">offers </span>is<br/>
so very great that on no account ought it to be abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">15th </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">day.-Balf </span>a day is more than <span style="color: #0000FF;">sufficient </span>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit<br/>
