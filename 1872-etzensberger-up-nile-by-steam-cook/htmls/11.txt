<span>10 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
they have been accustomed so long to have it all their own<br/>
way, that they do not like to <span style="color: #0000FF;">sacrifice </span>any of their privileges.<br/>
In going by Steamer, the traveller is saved an enormous<br/>
amount of trouble and expense; no bargaining, no <span style="color: #0000FF;">contract</span>, and no quarrelling when the journey is completed.<br/>
All he has to do is to take his Ticket and come on board<br/>
at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">appointed </span>hour<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Time and patience will work the change from sail to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">V </span>steam, even on the Nile<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>there is no reason whatever why<br/>
people ought not to travel by steam on this enormous<br/>
stream, as well as on other rivers whose <span style="color: #0000FF;">shores </span>offer more<br/>
variety'and more attractions to the ordinary visitor and<br/>
sight-seer. The order of sight-seeing by Steamboat is perfectly in harmony with the importance of the monuments.<br/>
The stoppings take place in sailing up stream, beginning<br/>
at the tombs of Beni-Hassan, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">finishing </span>at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philm</span>. By<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'-9</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>thus visiting the temple of Dandarah, and other minor<br/>
monuments, before Thebes, they lose nothing of their grandeur, and produce their <span style="color: #ff0000;">full </span>impression. The time allowed<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fixed </span>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">sight-seeing </span>is quite adequate and sufficient,<br/>
whatever may be stated to the contrary; out of all the<br/>
passengers who made the Tour on board the Steamers,<br/>
there was not one who was not thoroughly satisfied in this<br/>
respect.<br/>
<br/>
A passenger by Dahabeah is conveyed up stream as fast<br/>
as possible, whenever there is a favourable wind, by day or<br/>
night, and begins sight-seeing at the wrong <span style="color: #0000FF;">end.</span>--on his<br/>
way down; a Steamer never travels by night, and, therefore, has the double advantage, that no scenery is lost, and<br/>
sleep is <span style="color: #0000FF;">undisturbed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Nearly every week in the season a Steamer is <span style="color: #0000FF;">regularly<br/>
<br/>
