<span>60 TOURIST PROGRAMMES<br/>
<br/>
to reach Nazareth for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">next </span>Sunday, and as that is an<br/>
object to be aimed at, we, therefore, on<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday, the ELEVENTH DAY, leave J <span style="color: #ff0000;">erusalem </span>for the<br/>
division of Samaria. At noon we lunch at BETHEL, where<br/>
Jacob had his wonderful vision of the ladder reaching to<br/>
heaven, as he rested his weary head on a pillow of stone.<br/>
We afterwards pass through a richly cultivated region of<br/>
fig trees and olive trees; the mountain sides being terraced<br/>
and planted, as they doubtless were in the days when the<br/>
land yielded its abundance. We pass through a deep<br/>
ravine, unpleasantly designated the Robbers' Glen, and our<br/>
Dragomans fire their revolvers and guns frequently, either<br/>
to try the echoes, or to warn marauders of their approach.<br/>
The valley has a bad reputation, and we are glad to be able<br/>
to get through it and rest for the night at Sinjel, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>high point, commanding fine views of Shiloh and the surrounding plains and hills, where the children of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Israel </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">are<br/>
</span>said to have mustered in millions. There was ample room<br/>
for them.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, the TWELFTH DAY, we call at Shiloh in the<br/>
morning, and afterwards travel over a rich plain, amongst<br/>
fine crops of wheat and barley, <span style="color: #0000FF;">till </span>we come to JACOB'S<br/>
WELL, near the entrance of the valley which lies between<br/>
Mount Ebal and Mount Gerizim. All are interested to<br/>
learn if there is water still in the ancient well, and if a<br/>
cord can be obtained, a bucket or jar can be let down to<br/>
try the test. We have seen a cord of <span style="color: #ff0000;">70 </span>feet let down into<br/>
the well without any water being brought up, and we have<br/>
seen a jar brought up <span style="color: #ff0000;">full </span>of beautiful water from a depth<br/>
of 35 feet. We halt for the night at NABLOUS, the ancient<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shechem</span>, or Sychar. Nablous contains a large population,<br/>
and Dean Stanley says there is in it the oldest and the<br/>
smallest sect in the world-the sect of the Samaritans, who<br/>
still conduct worship in accordance with ancient practices,<br/>
and who yearly offer <span style="color: #ff0000;">gacrifices </span>on their historical mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Friday, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">THIRTEENTH </span>DAY, we again traverse historical ground, calling at the modern village on the alleged<br/>
site of the ancient city of Samaria, visit the Church of<br/>
St. John, and afterwards descend the hill on the top of<br/>
which is supposed to have stood the Ivory Palace of Ahab<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
