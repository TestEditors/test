their behalf during this season, and may be consulted at<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Shepheard</span>'s Hotel, Cairo, any day from Nov. 10th, 1872, to<br/>
end of March, 1873. Regular fortnightly departures from<br/>

book passengers through from London and Paris or other<br/>
central places in Europe, to Egypt, by any of the Railway<br/>
and Steam boat Lines. Tickets available by all the Egyptian<br/>
Railways and Steamers on the Suez Canal are also sold<br/>
at their <span style="color: #0000FF;">Office </span>in Cairo (Shepheard's Hotel), and will<br/>
be found to save a great deal of trouble and loss to<br/>
passengers in Egypt. <span style="color: #0000FF;">During </span>next season a proposal<br/>
to create a Circular Ticket at reduced Fares, will be<br/>
made to the General Administration of Egyptian Railways; and it is hoped that a considerable reduction<br/>
