<span>FOR THE EAST. 37<br/>
<br/>
JOHN M. COOK accompanied a party of about thirty to the<br/>
States, most of whom extended their Tour as far as Chicago,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">St. </span>Louis, the Mammoth Cave of Kentucky, the battle-fields<br/>
of the South, Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Boston,<br/>
the Falls of Niagara, the islands of the St. Lawrence, and<br/>
Canada. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iti07</span>, the year of the Great Exhibition of<br/>
Paris, Mr. JOHN M. COOK again visited Canada'and the<br/>
United States for the purpose of completing arrangements<br/>
for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">great </span>attraction in Paris, and he left America with<br/>
the best assurances of the Companies interested, that his<br/>
labours should have their eo-operation. But all these<br/>
proposals and promises of support were frustrated by the<br/>
jealousies and concealed opposition of local agents, and it<br/>
became quite evident that the only way to secure the <span style="color: #0000FF;">result<br/>
</span>of our proposals would be to arrange with some one equally<br/>
interested with ourselves, who, on the spot, should be <span style="color: #0000FF;">accessible </span>alike to Travellers and those who have the <span style="color: #0000FF;">management </span>of Railroads and Steamboats; and that is the position<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">iN </span>occupied by our co-partner, Mr. E. M. J <span style="color: #0000FF;">ESKINS</span>.<br/>
<br/>
These preliminary explanations were felt to be necessary,<br/>
as an introduction to the PROGRAMMES, which are <span style="color: #0000FF;">designed<br/>
</span>for AMERICA as well as for ENGLAND and the EUROPEAN<br/>
CONTINENT<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>and, as a farther preface to the arrangements<br/>
of the coming season, the following<br/>

Are copied from recent numbers of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eawrsionish </span>The<br/>
personality of this brief narrative is preserved, as the idea<br/>
of Eastern Tours originated with, and the system has<br/>
been mainly developed by, Mr. THOMAS COOK, who thus<br/>

</span>Although in the arranging and <span style="color: #0000FF;">carrying </span>out of Tours to<br/>
the East I have had the constant and energetic <span style="color: #0000FF;">co-operation<br/>

pronoun in my brief notes of their origin, progress, and<br/>
results.<br/>

I make no pretensions to the origination of Tours to the<br/>
Holy Land, as I remember to have <span style="color: #ff0000;">Men</span>, more than twenty<br/>
