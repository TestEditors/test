<span>FOR THE EAST. 63<br/>
<br/>
enter upon the excellent diligence road from Damascus to<br/>
Beyrout, we ride through the Christian village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Zaaheh</span>,<br/>
one of the most interesting places in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lebanon-a </span>place<br/>
of 10,000 inhabitants, nearly all professing the Christian<br/>
religion<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Our parties are always delighted to make the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">detour </span>through this educated village, where all the inhabitants<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">turn </span>out to welcome us, and the word "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Jlhrckshge8h</span>" is<br/>
never heard. We spend our last night in camp on the slopes<br/>
of the Lebanon <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>a considerable elevation of the road on<br/>
the way to Beyrout.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">TwEtpItEIcwm </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">DAY</span>, we mount horses<br/>
for the last time, cross the summit of the road at an elevation of over 5000 feet, and have the <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>delightful view of<br/>
the "glory of Lebanon."<br/>
<br/>
We reach <span style="color: #0000FF;">Beyrout </span>early in the afternoon, glad to avail<br/>
ourselves <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>the excellent Hotel accommodation there provided for us. Here Sunday, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">TWENTY-NIETII </span>DAY, and<br/>
Monday, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">TIIIRTIETH</span>, may be <span style="color: #0000FF;">most </span>pleasantly spent,<br/>
amidst an intelligent population, where the fruits of <span style="color: #0000FF;">education </span>are most apparent. The schools of the late Mrs.<br/>
Thompson, now under the management of Mrs. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Matte</span>, and<br/>
the educational arrangements of the American Mission, are<br/>
all intensely interesting. There are also some objects of<br/>
historical interest by the Doss River, a short ride from the<br/>
town.<br/>
<br/>
Monday, the THIRTIETH DAY, is the time for the sailing<br/>
of the Austrian Lloyd's Steamers from Beyrout for the<br/>
Coast of Asia <span style="color: #0000FF;">Minor </span>and Constantinople. We usually sail<br/>
in the evening.<br/>
<br/>
Thus ends the time allotted to Palestine and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lebanon </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>and the course afterwards may be briefly described. On<br/>
Tuesday the Steamer reaches CYPRUS, and most of the day<br/>
is spent there; on Wednesday and Thursday we sail to<br/>
RHODES, and if the time and weather are favourable we land<br/>
there for an hour or so. We sail past the isle of Patmos,<br/>
and other islands of ancient note, and on Friday, about<br/>
mid-day, <span style="color: #ff0000;">cast </span>anchor in the bay of Smyrna, where there is<br/>
time allowed to engage a Special Train and run up to<br/>
Ephesus, the interest of which is greatly enhanced by <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
