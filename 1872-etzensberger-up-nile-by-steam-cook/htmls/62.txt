<br/>
Arriving at Alexandria on a Thursday or Friday, <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Saturday </span>the party will proceed to CAIRO, and on <span style="color: #0000FF;">about<br/>
<br/>
</span>Wednesday in the following week the voyage up the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nile<br/>
</span>will be commenced. That voyage may be supposed <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>occupy twenty days, the return being on the Tuesday <span style="color: #0000FF;">or<br/>
<br/>
</span>Wednesday three weeks. This will leave'two or three <span style="color: #0000FF;">days<br/>
</span>more for Cairo and the locality, the Pyramids being <span style="color: #0000FF;">seen<br/>
</span>either before or after the Nile Trip, as may be found most<br/>
convenient.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">RETURNING </span>TO <span style="color: #0000FF;">Canto</span>, the route from thence to ISMAILIA<br/>
is through the fertile plains of the ancient land of Goshen,<br/>
and the Trip by Railway is usually made <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>Friday, to be in<br/>
readiness on Saturday morning for the Steamer on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Suez<br/>
</span>Canal to PORT SAID, where the Mail Steamer arrives at<br/>
about 3 <span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m. </span>We usually dine at the Hotel <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">10 </span>France,<br/>
Port Said, and then go on board the Austrian Lloyd's<br/>
Steamer for JAFFA, where we are due early on Sunday<br/>
morning. We hope to be there on the first Sunday in<br/>
March, and to find tents pitched in readiness for departure<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">en </span>the following day.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday is our FIRST DAY in Palestine, and is spent in<br/>
searching out historical places, generally beginning with the<br/>
"house of one Simon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">tanner</span>," beautifully situated <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>the<br/>
sea-side. There are other sites less marked and more<br/>
questionable than that of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Simon</span>'s house. The orange groves<br/>
attract all visitors, and it is also pleasant on some part<br/>
of the Lord's Day, to have a religious service, which is<br/>
usually held <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">school-room </span>of the devoted teacher, Miss<br/>
Arnott, who for more than ten years has been actively<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">engagedin </span>her laudable work.<br/>
<br/>
Monday, the SECOND <span style="color: #ff0000;">Day</span>, we travel across the PLAINS 0F<br/>
SHARON to RAMLEH, where we take lunch under the arches<br/>
of an ancient Khan, and then proceed to the valley of<br/>
AJALON, where we pitch <span style="color: #0000FF;">our </span>tents for the night.<br/>
<br/>
Tuesday, the THIRD DAY, our tents are struck at an<br/>
early hour, as <span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>purpose to pass by the most uninteresting<br/>
side of Jerusalem, and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">encamp </span>at night at <span style="color: #ff0000;">SOLOMON'S<br/>
</span>POOLS. We stop for lunch near Kirjath <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jearim</span>, or by the<br/>
side of that brook where tradition says David took up <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
