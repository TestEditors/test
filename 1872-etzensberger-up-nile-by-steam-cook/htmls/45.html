<span>40 TOURIST PROGRAMMES<br/>
<br/>
by accident, get into the Hotel at Alexandria, where I<br/>
found in the visitors' book some eight or ten names of a<br/>
party that I did not wish to follow, and I left the house<br/>
and made my future home at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">H0182 </span>de <span style="color: #ff0000;">l'Europe</span>, the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_____ </span>largest and best in the city. Whilst at the Hotel <span style="color: #0000FF;">d'Orient</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'__</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span>Cairo, I was applied to by Alexander Howard and his then<br/>
partner Abdallah Joseph, to give them at least a portion<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_.-___ </span>of my future work. Amongst other <span style="color: #0000FF;">qualifications </span>that<br/>
they urged was that of having served the party whose<br/>
names I had seen at Alexandria.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>That, I told them, was conclusive against my entering<br/>
into any negotiations with them, as I would never follow<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>in the wake of their former employer. They left, and the<br/>
day following again visited me, and Alexander especially<br/>
said that <span style="color: #0000FF;">whether </span>I <span style="color: #0000FF;">engaged </span>him or not, he should not<br/>
again serve the party referred to, who had kept them in<br/>
suspense in <span style="color: #0000FF;">reference </span>to a second party, then on the eve<br/>
of coming out, which was first said to consist of eleven<br/>
travellers, but had dwindled down to seven or eight, and<br/>
for even them there was <span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing </span>certain. His energetic<br/>
words were, "I mean business, and with you I know a<br/>
great business can be done, and I wish to serve you<br/>
exclusively." After much importunity, and when I saw<br/>
that he was free from other engagements, I consented to<br/>
give him a trial, and to this day ALEXANDER HOWARD has<br/>
been my faithful and approved Dragoman, and he can<br/>
bear witness to the fact that I would never lend my ear<br/>
to matters connected with the proceedings of others. The<br/>
"idea "and the "origination" of my Eastern Tours have<br/>
been alike my own, and if others have "<span style="color: #ff0000;">originated </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>anything, it has been their own proceeding, though I question<br/>
if the "idea "was not borrowed from my previous intimations, and advantage taken of my early announcements to<br/>
fix a date earlier than the one I was committed to, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
<br/>
</span>such means claim the originality of my ideas<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>I never borrowed ideas of Tours from any one, though<br/>
my original "ideas "have been moulded into a good many<br/>
Tourist systems of public companies<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and as for individual<br/>
speculators, they have made it their chief business to get<br/>
hold of my arrangements, copy my Tickets, and then call<br/>
them by their own names. As to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ease</span>, I should <span style="color: #0000FF;">be<br/>
<br/>
