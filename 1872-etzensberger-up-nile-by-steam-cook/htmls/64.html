<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">FOR </span>THE EAST. <span style="color: #ff0000;">59<br/>
<br/>
</span>pursue our uneven course over the wilderness of Judea,<br/>
and while our tents are being pitched and dinner prepared,<br/>
we call to see that singular Monastery of MAR <span style="color: #ff0000;">SABA</span>, built<br/>
in the rock <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the side of the Kedron. We presently<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">encamp </span>pretty near .to the black tents of wandering<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Bedouins</span>, who always conduct themselves towards us with<br/>
propriety.<br/>
<br/>
Friday, SIXTH <span style="color: #0000FF;">DAt</span>--We again scale mountains, descend<br/>
into deep ravines, and then emerge into the Talley of the<br/>
Dead Sea, at the shore of which we dismount, and most of<br/>
the visitors test the truth of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">statement </span>that it is not<br/>
possible to get under the water in attempting to swim.<br/>
From the Dead Sea we ride over the plains to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jordan</span>,<br/>
and take lunch on its bank, near where, tradition says, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the<br/>
</span>Saviour was baptised. We cross the broad valley and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">encamp </span>at Jericho, near to the Fountain of Elisha, the<br/>
waters of which irrigate and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fructify </span>a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">area </span>of very<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">lill </span>productive soil. We are sure to be visited at night by<br/>
natives of a village in the locality, who get up a sort of<br/>
Indian <span style="color: #ff0000;">war-ery </span>and dance in the style <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>savages. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">few<br/>
</span>piastres from each of the party are well appropriated in<br/>
conciliating these unpleasant-looking neighbours<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Saturday, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SEVENTH </span>DAY, is spent in ascending the<br/>
hills from <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jericho </span>to the summit of the MOUNT Oh<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>OLIVES,<br/>
from which point a view of Jerusalem is obtained <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>reconciles all to the passing by and keeping at a distance<br/>
from the city until this glorious sight could be obtained.<br/>
We pass <span style="color: #0000FF;">BETHANY </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>our ascent to the top of the Mount of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Olives</span>, and our memories are filled with the stories of <span style="color: #ff0000;">J </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">esus</span>,<br/>
and Mary, and Martha, and Lazarus, and the scenes and<br/>
circumstances of New Testament history. We pitch our<br/>
tents somewhere near the walls of the city, and feel that<br/>
we have reached a climax in our Tour.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Sunday</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Monday</span>, and Tuesday, the EIGHTH, NINTH, and<br/>
TENTH DAYS, are spent about, in, and around Jerusalem,<br/>
exploring and visiting all the chief objects and places of<br/>
historic interest. It is impossible to <span style="color: #ff0000;">partieularise </span>all that<br/>
can be seen within, around, and under the modern city; but<br/>
by working hard it will be possible to get away in <span style="color: #0000FF;">time<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
