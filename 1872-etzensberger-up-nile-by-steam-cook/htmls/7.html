</span>'6 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>those who have <span style="color: #0000FF;">witnessed </span>this, and have seen those<br/>
unfortunate parties return, and heard their tale of woe,<br/>
know better. During last season, 1871-2, several sad <span style="color: #0000FF;">in..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">cidents </span>happened, and frequently the Steamers were hailed<br/>
for medical assistance from the ship's doctor, or to take in<br/>
tow Dahabeahs wanting to return as fast as possible to<br/>
Cairo. Unfortunately, towing of any craft is strictly prohibited, and these applications had <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>to be declined.<br/>
<br/>
Even the most enthusiastic admirer of this <span style="color: #0000FF;">majestic </span>river<br/>
must confess that the scenery on its banks is very tame,<br/>
and soon becomes monotonous. On board a fast sailing<br/>
Steamer there is continual change, and every turn <span style="color: #0000FF;">brings<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">new </span>features, new sights in view. A Dahabeah, <span style="color: #ff0000;">when<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">becalmed,1nay </span>be detained in the same spot for a whole<br/>
week; or, if the passengers insist, as they must do if they<br/>
want to move on, and there is no head wind, the crew will<br/>
work away and haul the boat up <span style="color: #0000FF;">dream-a </span>very <span style="color: #0000FF;">painful<br/>
</span>sight, and really galley work. Look at those poor fellows<br/>
yoked together with a rope round their breasts, toiling<br/>
along with outstretched and swollen necks, and listen to<br/>
their painful song as they work, slowly advancing, by short<br/>
steps, at the rate of from five to six miles per day <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Floating </span>down river, if contrary winds' prevail, Dahabeahs are<br/>
no better off. Arabs can do nothing without singing most<br/>
piteously; their songs, which are described fully in every<br/>
guide book, may amuse you for a whole day, but become,<br/>
from constant repetition, quite unbearable.<br/>
<br/>
It very frequently happens that a party for a Dahabeah<br/>
is only made up in Cairo, between people who never knew<br/>
or met each other before. <span style="color: #0000FF;">On </span>starting, it is soon found<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">but </span>that their characters are anything but congenial; <span style="color: #0000FF;">one<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
