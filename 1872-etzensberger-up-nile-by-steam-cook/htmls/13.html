<span>12 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.<br/>
<br/>
spring or autumn. The climate from <span style="color: #0000FF;">November </span>to the end<br/>
of March is delicious, dry, and warm, with few exceptions.<br/>
No special precautions whatever are required, and it is quite<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">m1ffieient </span>to observe the regimen one is accustomed to. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Of<br/>
</span>all the tremendous dangers and frequency of ophthalmia,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">not </span>a single case occurred on board last winter, and it is<br/>
very rarely heard of amongst the travelling colony; <span style="color: #0000FF;">good<br/>
</span>physicians and chemists are established at Alexandria and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Cairo, and on board every ship there is a doctor supplied<br/>
with everything that may be wanted. The indispensable<br/>
blue spectacles we took on board, as advised, were never<br/>
taken <span style="color: #0000FF;">out </span>of their cases, and those who came on board<br/>
armed with them, in a few hours laid them by for<br/>
ever.<br/>
<br/>
The only thing of real use is a white or green muslin<br/>
veil, twined round the hat and covering the neck against<br/>
the sun; a <span style="color: #0000FF;">parasol </span>to be used as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>stick, and a pair of<br/>
gloves. Nor need any one be afraid of great heat during<br/>
the Nile Excursion on board a Steamer; on the contrary,<br/>
be careful to take a warm shawl or a good overcoat along<br/>
with you, as the evenings are very cool, and even during<br/>
the day, when steaming against the wind, it is sometimes<br/>
piercingly cold. The only places where the heat is really<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">felt </span>is during the three days' stay at Luxor, the Excursion<br/>
to the Kings' Tombs, and, when at Assuan, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philee</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>still,<br/>
as <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">rule</span>, any person accustomed to open air exercise can<br/>
easily support it, and the week spent on board the Steamer<br/>
before arriving at these places is a capital preparation.<br/>
Mosquitoes need not be feared, as they disappear from the<br/>
cabins as soon as the ship moves.<br/>
<br/>
All excess in eating and drinking must <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>course be <span style="color: #0000FF;">care<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
