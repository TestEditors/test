<br/>
smooth stones with which he slew the giant Goliath. The<br/>
road over the mountains is exceedingly interesting, and<br/>
affords from some points magnificent views of the Plains of<br/>
Sharon, and the blue waters of the Mediterranean beyond.<br/>
Leaving Jerusalem on our left, we skirt the valley of<br/>
Hinnom, pass at a distance the Hill of Evil Counsel, and<br/>
the Potters' Field, and stop our horses at the Tomb of<br/>
Rachel, the alleged site of <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>is covered by a small<br/>
mosque, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>house of prayer, with a dark chamber, 01' vault,<br/>
behind. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Remounting </span>horses, we see Bethlehem on our left,<br/>
very beautifully situated on high ground. On our right,<br/>
we get fine views of beautifully cultivated grounds, with<br/>
interesting modern villages, in which are Greek and Latin<br/>
Convents. The forest of olives is very beautiful. By<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">8olomon</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'s </span>Pools we get excellent camping ground, with a<br/>
plentiful supply of delicious water, which was of old conducted to Jerusalem, and still runs in a peculiarly constructed aqueduct to Bethlehem.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Wednesday</span>, the FOURTH DAY, leaving the camp early <span style="color: #ff0000;">in<br/>
</span>the morning, a long ride brings us to Hebron, where is the<br/>
Cave of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Machpelah</span>, in which Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob,<br/>
are believed by all intelligent <span style="color: #0000FF;">visitors </span>to have <span style="color: #0000FF;">been<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">entombed</span>. We return to the camp at the Pools of Solomon,<br/>
and rest there another night.<br/>
<br/>
Thursday, the FIFTH DAY, we pass by a deep valley on<br/>
the right, where peaches grow in great profusion, and the<br/>
land watered from the Pools is very fertile. Here was said<br/>
to have been the gardens of Solomon, and it is not difficult<br/>
to realize the historical fact that some of those <span style="color: #ff0000;">gafdens<br/>
</span>that the wise king planted were really in this beautiful<br/>
valley. At noon we reach BETHLEHEM, and cannot fail to<br/>
be deeply interested by our visit to the caves of the rocks<br/>
in which the Saviour was born of the Virgin. The village<br/>
and the people are interesting, though they pester us sadly<br/>
with their beads and mother-of-pearl articles. We either<br/>
lunch at the Convent attached to the Church of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nativity</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>descend the hill to the plains where shepherds<br/>
watched their <span style="color: #0000FF;">flocks </span>and angels sang of the Saviour's<br/>
birth. An enclosure, called the Shepherds' Field, is a<br/>
pleasant place for our mid-day meal. After lunch <span style="color: #0000FF;">we<br/>
