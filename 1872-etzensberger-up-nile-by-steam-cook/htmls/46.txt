<span>FOR THE EAST. 41<br/>
<br/>
sorry to be in any way identified with such <span style="color: #0000FF;">defalcations </span>as<br/>
were voluntarily reported to me on my last visit to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jaffa</span>.<br/>
A Vienna contractor once wrote me proposals for <span style="color: #0000FF;">partnership </span>Tours to the East. I replied that I always preferred<br/>
to do my own work, in my own way, and to bear my own<br/>
responsibilities. The next I heard of the poor fellow was<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">____</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">... </span>that he had sent a Courier with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>party to Palestine. On<br/>
the way his funds were exhausted. He wrote to his<br/>
employer for money to enable him to proceed, but instead<br/>
of sending "the <span style="color: #0000FF;">needful</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>to rescue his representative, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>unfortunate <span style="color: #0000FF;">speculator </span>terminated by poison the lives of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">______</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>himself, wife, and two or three children. Only the other<br/>
day a Travelling Agent from Vienna came to 98, Fleet<br/>
Street, to beg for employment, stating that he had been<br/>
engaged, by somebody of Vienna, to conduct a party <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
</span>four gentlemen round the world, but his funds were <span style="color: #0000FF;">exhausted </span>on arrival in London, and he could not get <span style="color: #ff0000;">means<br/>
</span>to go forward. The case was represented to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Austrian<br/>
</span>Consul, but nothing could be done with it, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gentle<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">men </span>had to stop short in their proposed Tour. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">proposal<br/>
</span>which we now have from Vienna, representing 10 to <span style="color: #0000FF;">20<br/>
</span>candidates for a Round-the-World Tour, looks very <span style="color: #ff0000;">auspieiously</span>, and we shall most certainly persevere in our <span style="color: #0000FF;">own<br/>
<br/>
</span>work and bear our own burdens. We neither wish to copy<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>nor be copied. I have been led into this digression <span style="color: #0000FF;">by<br/>
</span>circumstances connected with Eastern Tours; but enough<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">it-I </span>return to my story.<br/>
<br/>
TOURS OF FOUR SEASONS TO THE NILE,<br/>
PALESTINE, <span style="color: #0000FF;">& </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">e.<br/>
<br/>
</span>It is not necessary to <span style="color: #0000FF;">particularize </span>the details of the<br/>
whole of these Tours. Their totals present an aggregate<br/>
of nearly 400 <span style="color: #0000FF;">voyagers </span>up and down the N ile, from the<br/>
Arsenal of Boulak (Cairo) to the head of the First<br/>
Cataract, including the Island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philae</span>, and the granite<br/>
quarries of Syene, from whence were obtained all the<br/>
monoliths and other immense granite blocks, shaped into<br/>
forms, raised to positions, and demolished in ways and by<br/>
agencies of skill and power which puzzle modern <span style="color: #0000FF;">artists </span>and<br/>
