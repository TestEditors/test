recent discoveries of Mr. Ward, of the British Museum, <span style="color: #0000FF;">who<br/>
</span>has spent ten years there in digging for hidden treasures,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_7=_-u</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and whose labours and perseverance have been crowned by<br/>
discovering the site of the Temple of "Diana of the<br/>
Ephesians." We sail again on Saturday evening, pass<br/>
through the Dardanelles on Sunday morning, enter the sea<br/>
of Marmora in the afternoon and reach the Golden <span style="color: #0000FF;">Horn<br/>
</span>early on Monday morning. We land at the City of the<br/>
Sultan, stay there till Saturday morning, and then embark<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_ </span>for Athens. A change of Steamers takes place at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Syre </span>for<br/>
the Piraeus, where we arrive early on Monday morning, and<br/>
stay at Athens until Saturday, when we again embark for<br/>
Syra, change Steamers there again, and go on to <span style="color: #0000FF;">complete<br/>
</span>our voyage at Brindisi or Trieste<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>ADDITIONS TO THE PALESTINE TOUR<br/>
<br/>
May be made by beginning at Beyrout, taking the coast<br/>
of Tyre and Sidon to Acre and Carmel; from thence, going<br/>
by the coast of Sharon, past ancient Caesarea to J <span style="color: #0000FF;">affa</span>, and<br/>
on to Gaza and other places in the Land of the Philistines,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">33</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">%</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>and going round a wider course to Hebron. This will <span style="color: #0000FF;">add<br/>
</span>more than a week to the Tour; and the remaining <span style="color: #0000FF;">additional </span>time to complete forty-two days can be well filled<br/>
up at other points. We offer that as our outline of a less<br/>
hurried trip through Palestine<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and the additional expense<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">___</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>can <span style="color: #0000FF;">be </span>regulated by the numbers of the Tourists. The<br/>
extra fourteen days will cost about Â£20 each traveller,<br/>
more or less, according to the number of the party.<br/>

</span>AN ABRIDGED PALESTINE TOUR<br/>
<br/>
May be made by entering at Jaffa, and terminating at<br/>
Caifa, foot of Mount Carmel, taking in all that has been<br/>
marked out in the daily arrangement <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>far as Nazareth<br/>
and the Sea of Galilee, and thus completing a kind of half<br/>
Tour in fifteen days, for which there would be a reduction<br/>
of an equitable amount, in accordance with the provision<br/>
made by the Dragoman.<br/>
<br/>
We should be very glad to arrange for a party to start<br/>
from Beyrout at the time the other party starts from J aifa<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">first </span>week of March, for a Tour of forty-two days <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
