"UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 15

__________ time to study hieroglyphics and history while moving on
:1... in a Steamer, the changing scenery taking up the whole
time and interest; therefore, the greatest part of the work
is useless for the moment.

One of the most practicable and best-adapted guide books

other guide books; there was but one copy of this
"Austrian Lloyd's Book." Very soon they all had to
flock round it for information, and it was unanimously

and sound information-a thing nearly impossible to obtain
in Egypt-we can recommend no better book than Heinrich
Stephen's "Des Hentige Egyptem" (F. A. Brookhaus,
