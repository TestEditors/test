44 TOURIST PROGRAMMES

and cheerful testimonials to their respective Dragomans.
For any parties,1arge or small, we are now prepared to
provide all necessary accommodation on such terms. as the
season of the year and the numbers of the parties render
practicable. Om: spring arrangements are necessarily
cheaper than those of autumn, as in the latter season we
cannot command the numbers necessary to secure the com
cessions by which our rates of charges are regulated.

The educational and social results of these four years
of Eastern travels have been most encouraging. A new
incentive to scriptural investigation has been created and
fostered; "The Land and the Book" have been brought
into familiar juxtaposition, and their analogies have been
better comprehended; and under the genial influence of
sacred scenes and reputed sites of Biblical events, enquiring
and believing spirits have held sweet counsel with each
other. Devoted ministers have gone to investigate scenes
and objects of long study and practical illustration, and
have returned richly laden with new additional and corroborative facts to enrich their ministrations, whilst in
general their physical health has been equally benefited.
It is not in time that the full benefits of Travels in Bible
Lands can be fully realized l the information acquired, the
facts studied, the aspirations engendered, reach beyond
time and add to the obligations and hopes of futurity.
Often as I meet one at least of my ministerial patrons, I
get a warm grasp of the hand of a true and earnest worker
for man's welfare, accompanied by such words as, "Oh,
Mr. C, I shall remember that Tour through Palestine with
you through all time and through all eternity. t"
The details of these Eastern Tours have been given at
great length m the most recent series of the E'ztrursionist,
and I close the retrospect to make way for new and extended
proposals of future public service.
