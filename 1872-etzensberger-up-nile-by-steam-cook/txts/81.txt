I ] RLP-B () () K FOR TRAVELLERS
TO THE EAST,

EGYPT, PALESTINE, TURKEY, GREECE, AND ITALY.
By the REV. JABEZ BURNS, 13.13., la.D.













With Tourist Arrangements by THOMAS COOK, and specially designed Maps
by KEITH JOHNSTON.

TO BE BAD THROUGH ALL BOOKSELLEBS, AND OE? THOMAS COOK & BON,
98, FLEET STREET, LONDON.



The general principles, routes, and modes of travel, with other details of Palestine arrangements, are set forth with considerable distinctness and accuracy in
the "Help-Book for Eastern Travellers," compiled conjointly by Dr. J Ann: BURNS
and Mr. Coon, after their first journey together to the East, and as that work is
much cheaper than most books relating to Eastern Travel, we rceommend iuquirers
to obtain and peruse it.
