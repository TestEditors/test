16 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

Leipzig, 1872.) If there is no English translation published
yet of this remarkable work-eorreet in every respect except
in the statements concerning traffie on the Nile-it would
be desirable, and greatly to the interest of all travellers,
that there should be one soon.

In his statements concerning the Nile Steamers there
is a slight error, as the real fare is exactly one half of that
mentioned-but then it must be considered that the author
was one of the Viceroy's invil√©s in 1869, and had a "free
passage," and that no one can or will give any positive and
reliable information in this country.

DEPARTURE FROM CAIRO AND DAILY
ITINERARY.

Having secured a passage and paid for the Ticket, the
preparations are soon completed; passengers have but to
come on board at the appointed time with their luggage.
Small change in copper-about ten francs a head-ought
to be procured in Cairo, and linen enough packed up to last
for three weeks, no washing being done on board or by the
way. For a small gratuity the sailors will wash small
things, such as socks and handkerchiefs, but no ironing is
done. A good stock of wines, ales, and other drinks are
provided on board at moderate charges, and no passenger is
allowed to bring on board any provision of this kind.

During the winter Steamers will leave Cairo (Boulak)
regularly every fortnight, for this present season, 1872-73,
departures are advertised, and will take place from Tuesday,
December 10th, at 3 p.m., on every alternate Tuesday, to
the beginning of March. Any family party, or friends
