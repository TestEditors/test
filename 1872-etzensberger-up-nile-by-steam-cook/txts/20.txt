willing to pay for at least 14 full passages, or more, according to the size of the Steamer disposable; in this case the
time allowed (20 days) may be prolonged, and stoppages
ordered at pleasure, on condition that overtime be paid in

first day brings it up to Badreichan (railway station and
starting point to visit the site of Memphis, the Serapeum,
and the Pyramids of Sakkarah and Duehoer). These places,
being so near to Cairo, and easily accessible by rail, are
