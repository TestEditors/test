UNDER THE MANAGEMENT AND PERSONAL DIRECTION OF

THOMAS COOK AND SON,

AND ASSISTANTS.

a..-
THE PRINCIPAL ROUTES, CONDITIONS, and CHARGES of
Cooks AMERICAN, EASTERN, and CONTINENTAL TOURS, are
set forth in detailed Programmes, already published, and
which will be attached to these Supplementary Programmes
of dates and additional particulars of Personal Supervision
of the arrangements of the approaching season. It will have
been seen in the previous Programmes, that the aims and
scope of these arrangements embrace the circle of THE
WORLD, and that Mr. THOMAS COOK has already entered upon
the greatest organized and publicly advertised Pleasure
Expedition of modern, if not of any other times. Ere these
details can meet the public eye, he will have nearly crossed
the American continent, from the Atlantic to the Paeifie,
accompanied by a party of English and American Tourists,
who expect, in the month of February, to meet other parties
from England and the Continent, in Egypt, and to
accompany them up the Nile and through Palestine. These
