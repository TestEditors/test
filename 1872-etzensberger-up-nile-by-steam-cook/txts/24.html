"att 9M day.--At Luxor. The first day is generally devoted
=-=_= to a visit to the Kings' Tombs. Starting early in the
morning across the stream by boat, where donkeys have
already been conveyed by the same means, in about an
hour we arrive at the Temple-palace of Kournah, and after
having visited it, continue our journey through the desolate
valley, "Bab-el-hfulak," to the Rings' Tombs. Only two
I or three of the most interesting are entered, which is quite
offieient-Belzoni'g Tomb, No, 17, and Bruce's, No. 11.

in the entrance of Tomb No. ti, those who like to walk can
go over the mountain chain, and come down near the
Memmonium or Rameenm; the others return by the same
way they came, and a halt is made at the Memmonium.
On the way back to Luxor the ruins of the Temple of
Amunoph II. and the sitting Colossi are visited.

10 & day.---At Luxor. Once more across the river, and
partly over the same ground as the day before; we visit
the Temple-palace of Medinet Haboo leisurely, and after
lunch make an excursion to one of the most interesting
private Tombs, No. 35, called "Dayr-el-Medinet," situated
on a hill behind the Memmonium. Close by are the Priests'
Tombs, the largest of which may be visited (although it is
scarcely worth the trouble) by those who are not easily
frightened by bats and rather rough and dangerous passages.

A second stay is made afterwards at the Memmonium,
