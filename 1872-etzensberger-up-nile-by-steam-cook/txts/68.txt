FOR THE EAST. 63

enter upon the excellent diligence road from Damascus to
Beyrout, we ride through the Christian village of Zaaheh,
one of the most interesting places in the Lebanon-a place
of 10,000 inhabitants, nearly all professing the Christian
religion, Our parties are always delighted to make the
detour through this educated village, where all the inhabitants
turn out to welcome us, and the word "Jlhrckshge8h" is
never heard. We spend our last night in camp on the slopes
of the Lebanon at a considerable elevation of the road on

Saturday, the TwEtpItEIcwm DAY, we mount horses

of the Austrian Lloyd's Steamers from Beyrout for the
Coast of Asia Minor and Constantinople. We usually sail

Tuesday the Steamer reaches CYPRUS, and most of the day
is spent there; on Wednesday and Thursday we sail to
RHODES, and if the time and weather are favourable we land
there for an hour or so. We sail past the isle of Patmos,
and other islands of ancient note, and on Friday, about
mid-day, cast anchor in the bay of Smyrna, where there is
time allowed to engage a Special Train and run up to
Ephesus, the interest of which is greatly enhanced by the
