the rate of £44 sterling, excessive-although it includes
everything-living, sight-seeing, guides, and donkeys. Coal
is very expensive upon the Nile, and the servants and crew
in these small Steamers always outnumber the paying passengers. No private enterprise could possibly work these
Steamers regularly without loss, and, as stated above, it is
only managed by Government assistance. Taking into consideration all these circumstances, any ehort-cominge ought
to be endured and disposed of with an easy temper; the
Tour once accomplished, every little hardship is naturally
soon forgotten, and nothing will remain, but to remember,
with unalloyed pleasure, the interesting journey and the
wonderful scenes visited.

Another great service has been indirectly rendered to
the travelling public by the revival of Steamboat traffie on
the Nile. During the last few years the prices for Dahabeahs
have risen to an extraordinary height. Last winter, before
the Steamers began to ply, the price asked for a firit.e1aiss
boat was from soo to £120 sterling a month, for three or
four months; a short time afterwards they came down to
£60, or even lower, and remained stationary at that rate all
the season through. It is quite natural that Dragomans,
owners of Dahabeahs, and the numerous class of tradesmen
whose interests are threatened, are not much in favour of
Steamers, which will surely diminish, or partly destroy,
their business; and any one applying to such people for
information may certainly expect to be misled, and to hear
the most awful reports about the Steamers. Many instances occurred last season, where Dragomane absolutely
declined to obey the written orders of their employers;
