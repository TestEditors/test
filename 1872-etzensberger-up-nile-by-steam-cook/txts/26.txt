"UP THE NILE BY STEAM. 23

here in about five hours: as soon as the Steamer steps, a
swarm of Nubionseome to offer ostrich feathers, eggs, and
other articles, for sale.

14% dar-M Assuan. Early after breakfast donkeys or
camels, at choice, are waiting to carry us through the town
and bazaar of Assuan, and the cemetery, to the desert road
leading towards Philos About a mile from the town, on
the hills to the left, are the celebrated granite quarries
where the obelisks were extracted from, and which are
best visited now. Continuing our road afterwards, in about
one hour we arrive on the river, where a boat is waiting to
convey us over to Phila:. Until about 3 o'clock in the afternoon there is sufficient time to visit this enchanting place
in every part, h1neh, and rest; then we once more go on
board the boat, either to take us back to the place where weembarked, or, if the wind permits and the company have
'__, made arrangements, to shoot the Cataracts in a Dahabeah
(which is at their own expense and risk); the same boat
brings us to our Steamer at Assuan in about two hours.
The charge for a Dahabeah for a party to shoot the Catsraets is from £5 to £8 sterling. If the wind is contrary,
or no arrangement has been made for shooting the Cuteracts, then we again mount our donkeys or camels-the
latter operation being rather dangerous-and return to
Assuan by another road, striking to the left towards the
village of Mohattan, and coasting the river all the way
down, enjoying the most magnificent and varied views of
the wild scenery. As a rule, guides and donkey boys do
not like to take this way back, but the interest it offers is
so very great that on no account ought it to be abandoned.

15th day.-Balf a day is more than sufficient to visit
