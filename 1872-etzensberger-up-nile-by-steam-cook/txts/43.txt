38 TOURIST PROGRAMMES

projected Tour to Palestine, at a cost of about 2200. But
I cannot remember the details, nor the comprehension of
the scheme, nor do I know what came of it.

I believe it is now twenty-ihree years since I met, in one
of my Highland Tours, a distinguished English clergyman,
who first led me to think of the matter seriously, and from
that time, however silently the idea slept under the heavy
load of other engagements, I had always anticipated that
it must be done at some convenient season. C Under that
impression I made a special journey from Leicester to
London, in 1850, to see the late J AMES SILK BUCKINGHAM,
the famous Oriental traveller, from whom I received much

Mr. Buckingham was just the man to sympathise with

Afterwards the subject was frequently mooted, and once

But in 1864 my Son came back to my assistance, and I
then felt at liberty to look both East and West, and my
plans were developed in 1865, when I announced a Tour
to America for the coming spring, and my purpose of
making an Eastern arrangement for the termination of
1866.

I started for the United States in November, 1865, travelled from New York to Montreal, Niagara, Detroit,
Chicago, Wisconsin, St. Louis, Cincinnati, Baltimore, Washington, Philadelphia, and other places, about 4000 miles
from New York, and over all the Lines I made special provision for Circular Tickets, at uniform rates. My Son left
England in May, 1866, with a Party of about 30, to test
