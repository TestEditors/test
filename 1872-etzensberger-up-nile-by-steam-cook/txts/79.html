74 TOURIST PROGRAMMES

AN INTERMEDIATE PARTY FOR THE NILE
AND PALESTINE

May leave London or Italy so as to sail from Trieste or
Brindisi on the 14th of February, leave Cairo for the Nile
on the 26th of February; return in time to fall in with
the Second Palestine Party at Cairo on the 2lst of March,
and accompany that party through Palestine.

are stated in the general Programmes of the Tours.

EXTENDED TIME IN PALESTINE

Can also be arranged for at proportionate charges for the
extra time. All Fares are on the lowest scale between the

In order that satisfactory arrangements may be made
with Steamboat Companies, the Dragoman, and others, early
DEPOSITS are earnestly solicited. A deposit of Â£10 on the
Palestine Tour, and of S15 on the combined Nile and
Palestine Tours, will be suffkient; and if anything occurs
to prevent Depositors making the Tours, they can transfer
the amount to others, or withdraw the sum at fifteen days'
notice prior to the time fixed for departure from London,
10 per cent. on the amount deposited being deducted for
office expenses. Less than fifteen days cannot be allowed,
as a fortnight's notice, at least, is required for giving the
necessary orders; and all will be considered bond Jide

. travellers who do not withdraw deposits fifteen days before

the time fixed for departure.
