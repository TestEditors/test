12 UP THE NILE BY STEAM.

spring or autumn. The climate from November to the end
of March is delicious, dry, and warm, with few exceptions.
No special precautions whatever are required, and it is quite
m1ffieient to observe the regimen one is accustomed to. Of
all the tremendous dangers and frequency of ophthalmia,
not a single case occurred on board last winter, and it is
very rarely heard of amongst the travelling colony; good
physicians and chemists are established at Alexandria and
- _, Cairo, and on board every ship there is a doctor supplied
with everything that may be wanted. The indispensable
blue spectacles we took on board, as advised, were never
taken out of their cases, and those who came on board
armed with them, in a few hours laid them by for
ever.

The only thing of real use is a white or green muslin
veil, twined round the hat and covering the neck against
the sun; a parasol to be used as a stick, and a pair of
gloves. Nor need any one be afraid of great heat during
the Nile Excursion on board a Steamer; on the contrary,
be careful to take a warm shawl or a good overcoat along
with you, as the evenings are very cool, and even during
the day, when steaming against the wind, it is sometimes
piercingly cold. The only places where the heat is really
felt is during the three days' stay at Luxor, the Excursion
to the Kings' Tombs, and, when at Assuan, to Philee; still,
as a rule, any person accustomed to open air exercise can
easily support it, and the week spent on board the Steamer
before arriving at these places is a capital preparation.
Mosquitoes need not be feared, as they disappear from the
cabins as soon as the ship moves.

All excess in eating and drinking must of course be care
