</span>else, and in truth there was room for nothing more; in<br/>
the other there was a kind of press, into which, with the<br/>
exercise of some dexterity, one could climb, but it was so<br/>
low that one could only lie down. Two mattresses filled<br/>
the scanty space. Here two small men with limbs which<br/>
did not object to being doubled up would have to lie<br/>
beside each other. The rest of the crew had to sleep<br/>
on the top of this cabin. The helm hung behind.<br/>
<br/>
The crew were all fishermen of the lake, in wide, gay<br/>
robes, with turbans on their heads, not too clean and<br/>
smelling of stale fish. Not one of them was of Arab type;<br/>
they had dun-brown skins, broad faces, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>noses,<br/>
and were of muscular build, but not so thin and sinewy<br/>
as most <span style="color: #0000FF;">Arabs</span>. At the first glance one saw that' they were<br/>
a foreign stock; and, in fact, the borders of Lake Menzaleh<br/>
are inhabited by the descendants of the ancient Hyksos,<br/>
one of those Kushite tribes who were the overthrowers<br/>
of the fourteenth dynasty, and who have kept their race<br/>
unmixed. We had to live on our small vessel in the<br/>
closest contact with these scientifically interesting, but<br/>
personally unattractive people.<br/>
<br/>
Just before our start a blinded pelican was brought on<br/>
board as decoy bird, which however struck far and near<br/>
with its beak, and was so dirty that we sent it back to land<br/>
in a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
Each vessel had a small boat fastened to it and the<br/>
voyage began. These people handled their sails very<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully</span>, and by the help of a strong west wind the little<br/>
fleet glided quickly over the water. The Lake of Menzaleh is one of the largest brackish-water lakes in the<br/>
