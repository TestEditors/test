cigarettes. These worthy people had noble features and<br/>
an unmistakable air of distinction; they wore long beards,<br/>
and told long stories with the utmost pathos in Arabic,<br/>
to which we could only reply with friendly smiles. The<br/>
visit was short, and then we <span style="color: #ff0000;">betook </span>ourselves to our<br/>
horses, which were waiting outside the next gate of the<br/>
city.<br/>
<br/>
The Grand Duke and the other gentlemen rode back<br/>
to the camp, while Count Caboga and I took the rough<br/>
road into the Valley of Kedron. In this gloomy and<br/>
dismal valley, on the slopes of the Mount of Olives, there<br/>
are an enormous number of tombs. Even in the time of<br/>
the Jews this valley was counted unclean, as contrasted<br/>
with the adjacent hill of the temple. Pre-Christian<br/>
tradition taught that the judgment would be held here.<br/>
The Moslems accept this belief from the Jews, and bury<br/>
their dead on the eastern side of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Haram</span>, while the<br/>
Hebrews keep to the western slope of the Mount of<br/>
Olives.<br/>
<br/>
Both believe that at the sound of the trumpets which<br/>
announce the day of judgment the hills will recede and<br/>
make room for the multitudes of risen bodies. Christian<br/>
belief holds that here is the place where the rocks opened<br/>
and the dead appeared at the moment when the Redeemer<br/>
bowed His head in death, and the sun was darkened, and<br/>
the veil of the temple of Solomon was rent in twain.<br/>
<br/>
The Mount of Olives is steep and rocky in its lower<br/>
part; higher up the slopes ascend gently, and are covered<br/>
with slabs of rock and pebbles, interspersed with ancient<br/>
gnarled olive trees-the picture of a grey-green gloomy<br/>
