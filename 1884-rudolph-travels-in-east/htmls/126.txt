<span>68 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

ambush. The Baron and the Arabs went back down to<br/>
the quarry to watch the course of the sport. From our<br/>
elevated look-out it was just the right distance for small<br/>
shot to the lure lying at the bottom of the ravine.<br/>
<br/>
The weather had become cloudy, and small rain was<br/>
falling. This is the greatest rarity in Cairo, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whereuhey<br/>
</span>say that it only rains seven times in a year, and one of<br/>
these seven fell to us for our hunt, for which we should<br/>
have desired a perfectly clear sky.<br/>
<br/>
For a long time nothing came. The unceasing practising of bugles and trumpets reached us from the citadel,<br/>
while the heavy close air and the small space, which<br/>
prevented all movement, was stupefying. At last a pair of<br/>
ravens <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buttered </span>down, and thereupon some kites, impatient<br/>
for their breakfast. The loathsome <span style="color: #0000FF;">carrion </span>vulture <span style="color: #0000FF;">followed </span>with its bare skull.<br/>
<br/>
The tedious and prolonged waiting determined me to<br/>
advise my uncle, who had never shot one of these vultures,<br/>
to fire. No sooner said than done, and, as the smoke<br/>
cleared off, I hastened down to the spot. I begged my<br/>
uncle to wait a while longer, as the sun was breaking<br/>
through, and I descended with this most unsavoury spoil<br/>
to the quarry below. On arriving there, Baron Saurma<br/>
and I found a favourable post of observation, and awaited,<br/>
telescope in hand, coming events.<br/>
<br/>
In a quarter of an hour the first great vultures <span style="color: #0000FF;">appeared-the </span>mighty <span style="color: #ff0000;">Vuimr </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">fulzms</span>. With slow flapping<br/>
wings they moved round the summit of the mountain.<br/>
One followed another, and soon sixty had assembled in"<br/>
<br/>
the air<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
