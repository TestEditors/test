<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">14 </span>TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
drenched by heavy rain, we set forth in haste to return to<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning brought no favourable tidings from<br/>
the open sea, so our captain resolved to spend at least a<br/>
day in Zante.<br/>
<br/>
We decided thereupon to ascend Mount Skopo. On<br/>
the quay we got into carriages drawn by very small horses,<br/>
and drove through several streets, past the last houses of the<br/>
town, out along the coast. The carriage road very soon<br/>
came to an end, and we took our way on foot through<br/>
gardens and fields, among olive trees, and across dry watercourses, to the foot of the mountain. There the company<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'divided </span>for the ascent into two parties. I climbed past the<br/>
last human habitations, and then up the steep slope, thickly<br/>
overgrown with evergreen shrubs, on to some slabs of rock<br/>
and heaps of rubble<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The ascent was laborious and uninteresting. The sun<br/>
burnt fiercely, and we had needlessly burdened ourselves<br/>
by carrying our guns. Four-footed game there was none,<br/>
and the feathered world was poorly represented: only some<br/>
central European species, in their winter quarters.<br/>
<br/>
At the top of the mountain there is a small Greek shrine,<br/>
simple and unattractive, and beside it the abode of the<br/>
priest and his servant; the whole dirty, ruinous, neglected.<br/>
<br/>
Near this dwelling rises a cone of rocks of peculiar<br/>
formation. It is visible from afar, and had attracted our<br/>
attention from the sea the day before. This, as the highest<br/>
point, had to be scaled, and so we scrambled up toilsomely<br/>
over the large rock to the summit, to place there a <span style="color: #ff0000;">pockethandkerchief </span>on a pole by way of banner.<br/>
<br/>
