for the whole of our journey in the Holy Land. These<br/>
great officers were of a distinctly different type from that<br/>
of the Egyptians. The complexions were lighter, the<br/>
features broader-in a word, more Turkish in character.<br/>
We were soon to learn that this country differs in every<br/>
respect from Egypt<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Rizah-Pasha, a pleasant cultivated<br/>
man, in whose company we spent many interesting days,<br/>
handed me a letter from the Sultan. This high personage<br/>
was extraordinarily gracious to us, and we were to continue<br/>
to be his guests throughout our entire stay. To his<br/>
friendly favour we were indebted for a fine caravan, excellent tents, and many alleviations of the toilsome journey<br/>
which was to follow.<br/>
<br/>
After brief greetings the Turkish gentlemen went on<br/>
shore to put off their gala uniforms and to make sundry<br/>
arrangements. We had ourselves rowed to land soon<br/>
after, not, as heretofore, in our own boats, but, as is the<br/>
custom here, because of the treacherous coast, in broad<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flat-bottomed </span>boats handled by natives. A skilful pilot<br/>
was at the helm, and the powerful strokes of his men's<br/>
oars soon bore us far from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>. We were not<br/>
to see her again for a season, and during our journey<br/>
on land she was to anchor at Beyrout, the nearest safe<br/>
harbour. Two of the naval <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers</span>, Count Chorinsky<br/>
and Lieutenant Sachs, accompanied us into the Holy<br/>
Land.<br/>
<br/>
We soon reached the dreaded circle of the ill-reputed<br/>
reef. As the boat glided through the narrow way between<br/>
two jagged rocks, one could readily imagine how perilous<br/>
the passage would be in wild weather and foaming surf.<br/>
