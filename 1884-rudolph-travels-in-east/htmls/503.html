<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">AT </span>the limits of vegetation, where, along a sharply defined<br/>
line, thick shrubs give place to stony mountains, a fountain<br/>
bubbles forth from the ground in plenteous fulness and<br/>
flows into an ancient stone basin. Wherever springs<br/>
rise from the earth or brooks descending from the mountains bring blessing, there is verdure in wood, bush, and<br/>
field. These favoured strips extend along the currents<br/>
of water from the foot of the bare mountain to the Jordan<br/>
with its broad meadows. Alongside this blooming <span style="color: #0000FF;">line<br/>
</span>a rib of genuine steppe runs up to the next rivulet. The<br/>
plain of the Jordan is traversed lengthwise by the sacred<br/>
river with its green bands; <span style="color: #0000FF;">crosswise </span>it is divided into<br/>
alternating bands of steppe and of fertile though wild<br/>
garden landscape. The most beautiful of all these oases<br/>
is that which, beginning at the fountain of the Sultan,<br/>
descends as a broad band to the Jordan along the banks<br/>
of the rivulet. Our camp had been pitched beside the<br/>
spring at the foot of the mountains and the edge of the<br/>
verdure. From henceforth our journey was from spring<br/>
to spring, for to these the caravan which traverses these<br/>
wild regions must closely adhere.<br/>
