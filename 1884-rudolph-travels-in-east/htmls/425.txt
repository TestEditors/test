<br/>
that at the festivals which concern them, each will be left<br/>
unmolested by the others.<br/>
<br/>
The streets of the city are very dark and narrow. A<br/>
chill vault-like air, poisoned by the most horrible smells of<br/>
all kinds, pervades every spot within the confined stone<br/>
walls. The pavement, consisting of irregular flags, affords<br/>
the foot passengers a way of escape. Jerusalem retains<br/>
unchanged the old and gloomy Hebrew character, and has<br/>
nothing in common with the bright gay towns of Islam<br/>
and their bazaars.<br/>
<br/>
There were as many people in the streets as could be<br/>
crowded into them, and the doorways were filled with the<br/>
sight-loving public of all kinds-European pilgrims, Jews<br/>
and Christians, and Mohammedan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Orientals</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The procession went through a number of small streets,<br/>
and at length reached a flight of steps. Descending these<br/>
we were at the vestibule of the Church of the Sepulchre.<br/>
The court is paved and enclosed on two sides by high<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">wallsron </span>the third side is the principal <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade </span>with very<br/>
graceful pillars, and a fine gate with a lofty arch<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>This all<br/>
dates from the time of the Crusaders.<br/>
<br/>
The first sight of this chiefest of <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>sanctuaries of the<br/>
Christian makes a most solemn impression on every pilgrim,<br/>
which is further deepened by its position: the ancient<br/>
court lying several steps below the level of the rest of the<br/>
town, the grey houses of sad Jerusalem around, and in<br/>
their midst the weather-beaten Church of the Sepulchre<br/>
with its high cupolas.<br/>
<br/>
In the court the dealers in sacred images were squatting<br/>
round, and many Greek and Russian priests stood to watch<br/>
