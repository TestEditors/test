the doctrines of old <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egyptian </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sacred </span>lore is the conception<br/>

In a chamber, formerly carefully closed, in the tomb<br/>
of Seti I. (circa 1350 <span style="color: #ff0000;">3.0</span>.) we saw <span style="color: #ff0000;">thelikeness </span>of the so-called<br/>
cow of heaven. Beside it is a long and highly important<br/>
hieroglyphical inscription, relating to the annihilation of the<br/>
race of man and the reconstruction of a new order of the<br/>
world, which supplies the key to a right understanding of<br/>
the ancient Egyptian theogony.<br/>
<br/>
The translation of this mysterious record is as <span style="color: #0000FF;">follows</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">:<br/>
</span>"There was a king of Upper and Lower Egypt, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lightgod </span>Ra, the god who is Being itself. Whilst he reigned<br/>
as king men and gods were united. And men began to<br/>
devise wiles against the Light-god Ra, in order to be rid<br/>
of him. For his royal majesty had grown old. His bones<br/>
were of silver, his flesh of gold, his hair of pure sapphire.<br/>
And his royal majesty saw how he was mocked of men.<br/>
And his royal majesty spoke to those who were his<br/>
servants:<span style="color: #ff0000;">'Call </span>hither to me my eye and the Cloud-god<br/>
Shu, the Rain-goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tafnut</span>, the Earth-god Keb, the<br/>
Sky-goddess Nut, and at the same time the father<br/>
and mother who were united with me at such time as I<br/>
found myself in the primordial waters, and likewise also<br/>
him who bore my godhead in himself, the god of the<br/>
primordial water, Nun. Let him bring his <span style="color: #0000FF;">retinue </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/>
