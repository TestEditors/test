<span>336 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Behind our camp rose a high, bare, rocky hill, projecting<br/>
from the range of frontier mountains and separated from<br/>
them by a ravine. Greek hermits dwell in the caves<br/>
in the sides of this deserted valley. This settlement of<br/>
pious anchorites has existed from the beginning of the<br/>
Christian era to the present day.<br/>
<br/>
As we rode up to the spring a splendid sight awaited<br/>
us. The camp of the free Bedouins was pitched on the<br/>
left of the Jordan. Wonderful horses, mostly white, fed<br/>
in the rich grass. A chestnut mare, a dainty creature,<br/>
stood beside a tree, bound to its branches. It was the<br/>
battle horse of the master, of the grey-haired Sheik Ali.<br/>
Bedouins in long white robes, with turbans on their heads,<br/>
and armed with guns, daggers, and sabres, sat beside a fire<br/>
at which they were cooking their food. Long <span style="color: #0000FF;">lances</span>, the<br/>
badge of the great lawless tribes, the largest weapons which<br/>
can be described by the name of lance, cut out of the finest<br/>
wood, were driven into the ground side by side.<br/>
<br/>
Sheik Ali waited for me in front of our tents surrounded<br/>
by his sons and companions. The grey-haired nomad<br/>
king, with his noble delicate features, his pointed white<br/>
beard, his tall and still sinewy and upright figure, was<br/>
dressed in a richly ornamented robe of dazzling whiteness. He had a Turkish sabre buckled round his loins,<br/>
yellow shoes on his feet, and a broad turban on his head.<br/>
He extended his jewelled hand to me in friendly greeting.<br/>
His sons and the leading chiefs of the tribes stood round<br/>
him respectfully. Every movement bespoke unbounded<br/>
obedience, love, and reverence for their wise and <span style="color: #ff0000;">longtried </span>chief.<br/>
