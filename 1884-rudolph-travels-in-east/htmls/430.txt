<span>284 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

<br/>
to the small Franciscan convent, which also pertains to the<br/>
buildings of the Church of the Sepulchre. By narrow<br/>
stairs and dirty rooms, with horrible close air, we came to<br/>
a modest cell called the refectory. Here the friendly<br/>
monks entertained us with very good chocolate.<br/>
<br/>
During breakfast the custode of Terra Santa described<br/>
the contests and enmities which more or less unremittingly<br/>
prevail between the different creeds, and which sometimes<br/>
proceed from words to deeds. These, if they arise within<br/>
the church, are adjusted in energetic fashion by <span style="color: #0000FF;">mis..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">believing </span>Turkish soldiers. The sturdy monk spoke<br/>
valorously, and in vigorous terms cast the whole blame on<br/>
the Eastern Christians. It is difficult to decide on whom<br/>
the heaviest blame should devolve, but it is certain that<br/>
these constant altercations do not lend a halo to Christianity<br/>
in the eyes of the Turks.<br/>
<br/>
After breakfast we <span style="color: #0000FF;">went </span>over the whole convent. The<br/>
monks live in wretched cells; a terrace on the roof is the<br/>
only place where they can breathe fresh air. This small<br/>
Franciscan convent and the dwellings on the opposite<br/>
side of the church for Greek and Armenian priests are<br/>
all within the precincts of the Church of the Sepulchre,<br/>
which has only one gate, and this only opened by the<br/>
Turks, who exercise supreme control over it, on the occasion of great festivals or the arrival of many pilgrims, at<br/>
the request of one or of all the patriarchs. In the intervals,<br/>
often for weeks and months, the church remains closed, and<br/>
a combined guard resides within it and keeps jealous watch.<br/>
No gate is allowed into the city, either from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">poo</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>Latin<br/>
convent or from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">quarters'of </span>the Greek Christians<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
