<span>24 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In the narrow Arab quarters of the town one learnt<br/>
their value, for without them one would have passed with<br/>
difficulty and many stoppages through the throng of men<br/>
and beasts<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">No </span>sooner had we left the harbour precincts by its large<br/>
portal than full Eastern life burst upon us. A narrow street<br/>
of houses of Arabic style was crowded with people of all<br/>
descriptions; screaming donkey-drivers, the indispensable<br/>
water-carriers, vendors of all kinds, blue fellaheen shirts<br/>
jostling pure white burnous. Women whose dresses hung<br/>
in rich folds, bearing antique pitchers on their heads; blind<br/>
beggars with long staves; urchins, <span style="color: #0000FF;">clamorous </span>and riotous<br/>
as nowhere else but in the East. The Turks and natives<br/>
of Asia Minor, in their richly coloured dresses, struck us<br/>
at once; even in expression they differ entirely from the<br/>
Arabs, and their skin is lighter. The true Arab is dark,<br/>
his features are handsome and noble, his figure is slight but<br/>
muscular-in every respect superior to, but still unmistakably like, the Israelite. The fellaheen of the cultivated<br/>
hill lands is no true Arab. He is of the type ordinarily<br/>
found in the likenesses of the ancient Egyptians. I hold<br/>
him to be the original inhabitant of the country, and propose in another place to enter more fully into this matter.<br/>
<br/>
W hen we had traversed these short Oriental streets we<br/>
came to the European part of the town. Broad streets,<br/>
with handsome Western houses and shops, form that<br/>
quarter of the town; the central and most brilliant point<br/>
appears to be the Place Mehmet Ali. It were <span style="color: #0000FF;">uninteresting </span>to dwell further on the common features of a<br/>
<br/>
European seaport<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
