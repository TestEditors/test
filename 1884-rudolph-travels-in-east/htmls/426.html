<span>280 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

our procession. We entered by the principal gate. The<br/>
interior of the church is impressive, but likewise sad and<br/>
severe. Incense and attar of roses pervaded the damp,<br/>
clammy, heavy air.<br/>
<br/>
There were chapel gates to the right and left, staircases<br/>
and raised choirs, and the pilgrim soon sees that this great<br/>
house of God is an assemblage of differing rites and<br/>
modes of worship, and a compromise of their claims, and<br/>
that they all find room in the one space for their own<br/>
special services. In the centre of the church, in the great<br/>
circular hall, one chapel stands-a temple by itself; it is the<br/>
true Chapel of the Sepulchre, which belongs in common<br/>
to the Eastern and Latin Churches, and in which all the<br/>
ancient sects hold their worship. The newer faiths alone<br/>
are excluded-the Protestants and those of similar tenets.<br/>
<br/>
Ere we reached the Chapel of the Sepulchre the whole<br/>
procession knelt by the great square <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>stone of anointing,"<br/>
with its heavy candelabra round, and lying flat on the<br/>
ground we all kissed it. It is the stone on which the body<br/>
of Christ lay when anointed by Nicodemus. As the<br/>
Scripture tells: "After this Joseph of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arimathtea</span>, being<br/>
a disciple of Jesus, but secretly, for fear of the Jews, besought<br/>
Pilate that he might take away the body of Jesus: and<br/>
Pilate gave him leave. He came therefore, and took the<br/>
body of Jesus. And there came also N <span style="color: #ff0000;">icodemus</span>, which at<br/>
the first came to Jesus by night, and brought a mixture of<br/>
myrrh and aloes, about an hundred pounds. Then took<br/>
they the body of Jesus, and wound it in linen clothes with<br/>
the spices, as the manner of the Jews is to bury."<br/>
<br/>
Our devotions ended, we advanced to the entrance <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
