<span>358 <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRAVELS </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some traces of wild boar and hyaena filled us with<br/>
hope, but we were soon sadly undeceived<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The morass<br/>
proved to be too large and marshy. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters </span>could<br/>
not penetrate into it, and the driving consisted in running<br/>
round the edges with loud cries. The game was wary,<br/>
and not a single head left its safe shelter.<br/>
<br/>
Thereupon we remounted our horses and rode after<br/>
the others. A projecting ridge of stony ground had<br/>
to be crossed. From its northern slope we had a<br/>
splendid view over the broad plain, the grey western<br/>
border hills, and the lofty rocky mountains on the eastern<br/>
side of the Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
Before us lay, already visible, the mouth of the valley<br/>
and the well district of Abd-el-Kader--the immediate<br/>
goal of this day's travel. One sees a long distance in<br/>
these plains, and can attain but slowly the wished-for<br/>
station. The road led uninterruptedly across the steppe,<br/>
keeping at the foot of the mountains. Wherever we<br/>
turned we saw nothing but <span style="color: #0000FF;">stocks</span>. They let the horsemen pass within a few paces of them without vouchsafing<br/>
so much as a glance. Some birds of prey <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buttered </span>up<br/>
into the air, and a pair of the large Asiatic imperial eagles<br/>
floated low over my head. I lowered my gun quickly,<br/>
but only cartridges, and no <span style="color: #0000FF;">Small </span>shot, were to be found<br/>
in my pouch.<br/>
<br/>
The sun burnt fearfully. The grey mantle of cloud<br/>
which had darkened the sky in the morning hours had,<br/>
alas! entirely vanished. I soon <span style="color: #ff0000;">overtook </span>the caravans.<br/>
They presented a piteous picture. The mules followed<br/>
each other at intervals of some hundred paces, and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
