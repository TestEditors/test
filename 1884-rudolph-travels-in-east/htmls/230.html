<span>136 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the mountains began to recede, and gradually gave place<br/>
to the broad <span style="color: #0000FF;">and'well-tilled </span>plain of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>.<br/>
<br/>
By sunset the vessel reached the large town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>,<br/>
surrounded with palm groves, rich gardens, and shady<br/>
promenade. We put in at the landing-place and enjoyed<br/>
from the deck the gay picture of the stir and bustle of<br/>
Eastern life attracted to the banks by the arrival of the<br/>
steamer.,<br/>
<br/>
The evening was cool and refreshing after the genuine<br/>
African heat which had followed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">champsin</span>. After<br/>
dinner we landed and were received most kindly by the<br/>
governor. We rode on donkeys round the outside of<br/>
the town to the famous temple in its vicinity.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Esneh</span>, the old Egyptian Sini-called Latopolis by the<br/>
Greeks because of the worship there of the Latus fish-.<br/>
possessed a number of sanctuaries dedicated to the ramheaded god Chnum (the builder), of which the vestibule<br/>
of one of the largest is now the last relic. It lies half<br/>
buried in the soil of the modern city.<br/>
<br/>
An ancient Egyptian kalendar on the. basis of the<br/>
Alexandrian year, and the astronomical pictures in the roof,<br/>
give a special value to this building dating from the<br/>
Roman empire. By the light of many torches, this<br/>
temple hall, though belonging, as compared with the other<br/>
monuments, to recent times, looked exceedingly well, and<br/>
we remained for a long time in the dark dim chamber,<br/>
enjoying the interesting, scene. On our way back we<br/>
accepted the invitation of the friendly Mudir (governor),<br/>
and were soon all sitting in a ground-floor room of the<br/>
far from handsome Government building. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">lay</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
