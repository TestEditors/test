<span>ALEXANDRIA. 23<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Besides numerous Dalmatians, holding places in the<br/>
great banking houses, it was remarkable how many Austrians<br/>
there were from all parts of the monarchy; but by far the<br/>
larger portion of the colony consisted of those who were<br/>
not Austrian by birth-Levantines of all sorts, who for the<br/>
sake of security in trade, and above all, thanks to the<br/>
reputation and conspicuous activity of our Austrian Lloyd,<br/>
which is far too little valued at home, had placed themselves<br/>
under the protection of our nationality.<br/>
<br/>
After we had conversed for some time with these various<br/>
individuals, some of whom were our countrymen by birth,<br/>
and others only in name, they all left the Miramar, and we<br/>
retired to our cabins to change our uniform for civilian<br/>
attire. Soon after the whole party were rowed to the<br/>
harbour steps. Baron <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schaffer </span>was there to meet us, and<br/>
with him we entered the carriages which were waiting.<br/>
<br/>
A crowd of porters called "<span style="color: #ff0000;">hammhl</span>" and also "<span style="color: #ff0000;">scheyyal</span>," a class of the poorest Arabs, tightly girt in blue shirts.<br/>
with sinewy brown legs and bare arms; custom-house<br/>
officers in European uniform, Turkish sailors, dock labourers,<br/>
many of them of most striking appearance, surrounded us<br/>
gaping at us inquisitively.<br/>
<br/>
The Khedive was so good as even here to place some<br/>
of his carriages at our disposal. The carriages and horses<br/>
were English, the servants without exception French, in<br/>
modern European livery, the fez the only token of the East.<br/>
<br/>
Outriders, or rather runners, were not wanting-those<br/>
swift-footed, lank fellows, in fantastic dress, with flowing<br/>
white sleeves, wielding long staves. They always ran<br/>
before the carriages, vociferating unceasingly.<br/>
