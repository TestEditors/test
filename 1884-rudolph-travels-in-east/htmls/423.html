<span>THE HOLY CITY. 277<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The city where our faith was born, where with the<br/>
crucifixion of Christ the greatest of all changes in the<br/>
history of the world began, to whose walls thousands of<br/>
Bible stories and all the traditions of our religion cleave,<br/>
whose stones are stained with the blood of our forefathers,<br/>
the old Crusaders-this city lies there before us. Strange<br/>
mystic emotions of religious enthusiasm possess the soul<br/>
of each pilgrim and bring him near to fanaticism. To<br/>

taken shape and substance, surrounded by a dread, weird<br/>
world, laden with a curse under which the people who<br/>
dwelt here have been crushed for ever. Any one who stays<br/>
long in Jerusalem must become a fanatic. From the<br/>
moment one sees the city one is lifted into a region of<br/>
mystical enthusiasm which might easily gain a permanent<br/>
hold on the mind. These are the emotions which made<br/>
the Crusaders shrink from no sacrifice of goods or life,<br/>
and lend to all religious wars a desperate energy.<br/>

Let us, however, return to our entry. Some kavasses<br/>
from the consulate, in peculiar theatrical costumes, rode<br/>
in front with long staves. Next came a battalion of<br/>
Turkish infantry with their band-wonderful combination,<br/>
a procession into Jerusalem with Turkish music, and flying<br/>
colours with the silver crescent! We came next in full<br/>
uniform, riding, surrounded by ecclesiastics, officers of the<br/>
consulates, Turkish and Christian dignitaries.<br/>
<br/>
Crowds filled both sides of the streets. The road led<br/>
