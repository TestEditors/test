rocks and stones. The carriage crossed some ridges of<br/>
hills covered with scanty oak woods and evergreens. In<br/>
the valleys between these were marshy meadows in which<br/>
the coaches threatened to stick fast. The weather was<br/>
fortunately fine and not too hot, and the country was rather<br/>
picturesque. Many of the woods, too, were fairly well grown,<br/>
and flowers abounded. After a long drive we reached a<br/>
broad plain which stretches along the bay, whose northern<br/>
point is the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-known </span>town of Akha or <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ptolemais.s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>and the<br/>
southern cape, with Mount Carmel falling steeply to the sea,<br/>
is bounded by the town of Haifa. The plain itself is<br/>
well tilled and, along the banks of the little river of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nahrel-Mukatta</span>, even fruitful. A dreadful <span style="color: #0000FF;">road </span>with deep<br/>
ruts tortured us during the last' hour we had to pass<br/>
in Asia<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>Heavy clouds rose on the horizon. The sun was<br/>
darkened, and a cold wind from the sea seemed to bring<br/>
our first greeting from that chilly Europe to which we were<br/>
about to return. The last troop of camels, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">long-eared<br/>
</span>goats, the Arab horses, the fine manly figures in their<br/>
burnous, the gay raiment, the ample turbans, the Eastern<br/>
houses and burying-places, and all the peculiar and charming movement of Eastern life which had interested and<br/>
delighted us for so long, to which we had grown accustomed<br/>
and attached, were now eagerly gazed upon; each of us<br/>
sought to rivet a, last look in his memory, in order that<br/>
hereafter, in cold grey winter days, when the storms of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">North </span>torture the poor European, these scenes might rise<br/>
before the mind's eye, and one might feel one's self <span style="color: #0000FF;">trans<br/>
