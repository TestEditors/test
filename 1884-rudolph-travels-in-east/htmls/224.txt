Erment has played its part in antiquity. In Greek its<br/>
name is Hermonthis; in old Egyptian, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Anmonth</span>. Lying<br/>
on the west bank of the Nile, and southward from Thebes,<br/>
this town, with its <span style="color: #0000FF;">temples </span>dedicated to the god Month (the<br/>
last of which fell a prey but a few years back to Egyptian<br/>
barbarism), had the character of one of the most holy<br/>
places<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>After the political decline of the old imperial city of<br/>
Thebes, Erment became the metropolis of the Thebais, and<br/>
was the actual seat of government of the Greco-Roman<br/>
authorities for this part of Upper Egypt. The fragments<br/>
of a column of black granite found on the bank at Erment<br/>
are now in the Imperial collection at Vienna.<br/>
