character. Many civilians were also to be seen, Levantines,<br/>
Greeks, Italians, and Jews, with or without the fez.<br/>
<br/>
The members of the Austro-Hungarian community<br/>
came off to us in gaily decorated steam launches, and a<br/>
band gave us "God save the Emperor." Dalmatians in<br/>
the green and white costume of the valleys of the Bocchi<br/>
di Cattaro, their weapon-proof "Pas" round their slight<br/>
figures, waved their caps as they cheered. These Oriental<br/>
Christians were in remarkable contrast with the equally<br/>
splendid Eastern colouring of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Islamites</span>. The medley<br/>
of flags, colours, costumes, uniforms all around us in innumerable boats could only be compared to a kaleidoscope.<br/>

inquisitively around the ship.<br/>

The Consul-General, Baron <span style="color: #0000FF;">Schaffer</span>, soon came on<br/>
board with the officials of the Austrian Consulate. After<br/>
short greetings from them we had to receive the local<br/>
dignitaries, who came in a procession of gala barges. At<br/>
their head was Mustapha Pasha, the Minister of Foreign<br/>
Affairs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>His master had sent him from Cairo to receive<br/>
us. Then followed several generals and the harbourmaster. Abd-el-Kadir Pasha was also present in the<br/>
uniform of an Egyptian General of Division. The<br/>
Khedive had the goodness to assign this agreeable<br/>
and cultivated man of half-Turkish, half-Arab race to<br/>
attend upon us for the whole of our Egyptian journey. We<br/>
one and all of us learned to value and esteem him, and we<br/>
parted from him after our prolonged daily intercourse with<br/>
true regard. As soon as the Egyptian magnates <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew<br/>
</span>the Austrian settlers appeared<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
