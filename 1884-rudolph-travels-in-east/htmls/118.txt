appears as a city of historic note. It represents the earliest<br/>
period of the historic development of Egyptian civilization,<br/>
as Memphis does the ages which succeeded, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. those of<br/>
the kings who built the Pyramids, and Thebes the brilliant<br/>
period of Egyptian greatness from the eighteenth to the<br/>
thirteenth centuries before the Christian era. In Heliopolis we have the first settlement of the Kushite Arab<br/>
stock on their wanderings from the East. They afterwards took possession of the eastern portion of the Delta,<br/>
and introduced the worship of the sun where they established their first fixed abodes.<br/>
<br/>
"In the course of ages, from the time of the oldest dynasties, Heliopolis was adorned by the kings of the Egyptian<br/>
realms with temples, statues, and obelisks, whose number<br/>
and size used, even in the Middle Ages, to fill the Arab<br/>
writers with amazement. The Ptolemies, with their<br/>
Grecian culture, left the memorials of their predecessors<br/>
untouched, and strove to protect the temples from all<br/>
profane depredation. The Roman autocrats began to rob<br/>
the ancient holy places of their monuments. Two obelisks<br/>
travelled under Tiberius from Heliopolis to Alexandria, to<br/>
be placed in front of the so-called Caesareum, or Temple<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cesar</span>. Others were taken to Rome and Constantinople to serve as the mysterious witnesses of pre-historic<br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
"Only one obelisk has maintained its ancient place.<br/>
This it is which now rises in the midst of a tilled field, near<br/>
the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mulariye</span>, from below the surface of the soil<br/>
(its height is 20-27 m.), as the last token of the once<br/>
renowned City of the Sun, and the oldest of all known<br/>
