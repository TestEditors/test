<span>DESCENT TO THE VALLEY <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>THE? ORDAN. 321<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At the end of an hour we left the chosen spot, and dragging<br/>
the kid with us, as we wished to put it out the next day,<br/>
we went down on foot into the bottom of the valley.<br/>
The lower we descended the heavier and more oppressive<br/>
grew the air. A leaden atmosphere came up the side<br/>
valley as a first greeting from the Dead Sea and the<br/>
Valley of the Jordan. We were to learn to dread it in<br/>
the next few days.<br/>
<br/>
We soon reached the valley where our camp was<br/>
already completely pitched. It stood there like a small<br/>
town, and the utmost activity prevailed in the otherwise<br/>
lonely region.<br/>
<br/>
The two Arab huntsmen who had followed the caravan,<br/>
shooting as they came along from Latrun, appeared with<br/>
an ample supply for the kitchen. They brought with them<br/>
some of the pretty little rock <span style="color: #0000FF;">partridge</span>. It was the first<br/>
time that we had come within the limits of diffusion of<br/>
this beautiful bird.<br/>
<br/>
The Arabs, who with their imperfect weapons can only<br/>
shoot at sitting birds, creep up to their game under cover<br/>
of a brown or yellow painted curtain, which is stretched<br/>
upon two rods of sugar-cane, and gives sight and space to<br/>
fire through two openings for the eyes and one for the gun<br/>
barrel. The foolish birds see no one, and stare at the<br/>
moving curtain till the deadly shot issues from it.<br/>
<br/>
We breakfasted as soon as we arrived, while the Oriental<br/>
servants with much dexterity made quarters for the night<br/>
possible. Every stone had to be moved and the whole of<br/>
the grass searched. Great fat scorpions lay about everywhere. We made full acquaintance with their bad qualities<br/>
