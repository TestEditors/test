<span>312 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The narrow bottom of the valley is filled with blocks<br/>
of stone, old walls, and tanks. A stony path, made for the<br/>
flocks, winds from the village up the opposite hill-side.<br/>
Hoyos and I climbed between the olive woods and the<br/>
rocks, looking for birds whose call we could hear, when<br/>
suddenly the Grand Duke and some of the other gentlemen<br/>
appeared opposite, near the village, and strove to make us<br/>
understand by signs that game was moving about below<br/>
us. The terraced ground forbade our getting a good<br/>
view, so we hurried across to the other slope and learnt<br/>
that a big jackal had been doubling <span style="color: #0000FF;">leisurely </span>one stage<br/>
below us.<br/>
<br/>
Thereupon we scattered to different points of the<br/>
valley, to lie in wait for the wild beasts coming out at<br/>
sunset.<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>My Eastern companion <span style="color: #0000FF;">averted </span>that the "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Wauis</span>"<br/>
also greatly liked this place. The Arabs of Palestine call<br/>
the jackal Waui, not Taleb like the Egyptians, and in<br/>
general the Arabic spoken here differs so much from that<br/>
of Egypt as to be unintelligible.<br/>
<br/>
The evening was fine and the sun set. Flocks came<br/>
by led by picturesque herdsmen. The sound of the bells<br/>
mingled with their melancholy songs, and we could hear<br/>
the Ave Maria ringing in Bethlehem. The shadows<br/>
lengthened and the last red vanished from the mountains<br/>
of the Dead Sea, the eagles went to their roost, and a<br/>
jackal glided ghost-like across the valley. He came<br/>
towards my hiding-place, but the wind was not in the<br/>
right quarter, and the cunning beast disappeared behind<br/>
some rocky.<br/>
<br/>
A strange, dismal melancholy haunts the <span style="color: #0000FF;">desolate<br/>
<br/>
