<br/>
When we had completed the survey of this famous city<br/>
of the dead, we rode across the plain back to our steamer.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">W </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">e </span>had now to take leave of beautiful Luxor, the glorious<br/>
remains of hundred-gated Thebes. The Theban plain lay<br/>
wrapped in the mists of the hot noontide, and framed by<br/>
its setting of lofty blue mountains. It was a wonderful<br/>
picture for our farewell greeting.<br/>
<br/>
We spent the afternoon on our voyage, passing pleasant<br/>
hours <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>the deck; a cooling breeze came over the river,<br/>
and one lovely landscape after another met our gaze. At<br/>
six <span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">we </span>put in at Keneh, and this time landed not on<br/>
the western bank of Dendera, but on the eastern, by the<br/>
modern city..<br/>
<br/>
We employed the evening in hunting in the neighbourhood. Hoyos and I rode across the rich and, at this place,<br/>
broad plain, and then followed the course of a canal much<br/>
frequented by game, where we shot a variety of birds.<br/>
We rode through the water-channel at a shallow place,<br/>
and returned towards the town, in whose neighbourhood,<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">beside</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">smiling </span>gardens, a palm-forest rears its proud<br/>
tops. <span style="color: #0000FF;">- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>Kites, hawks, black-winged falcons, the large raven,<br/>
crows, screech-owls, and all kinds of small birds, sought the<br/>
shelter of this forest to roost. Knowing this, we hid<br/>
ourselves behind the thick stems of the date-palms, and<br/>
had easy and plentiful sport.<br/>
<br/>
When twilight followed a fine sunset, we rode back<br/>
along <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>dyke into the tolerably large town.<br/>
