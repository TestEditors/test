Water dripped everywhere; the ground was like a sponge.<br/>
Reeds, sedge, and shrubs sprouted from the marshy ground.<br/>
Many tracks of wild boar and well-beaten runs proved the<br/>
wealth of game in the place-an old Roman column was<br/>
quite worn away by the wild boar. Every evening, in<br/>
the absence of trees, they came here to rub themselves<br/>
against it. The Bedouin wished me to hide behind a<br/>
bush and await the coming of the animals, but I did not<br/>
feel the slightest desire to remain in that poisonous marshy<br/>

<br/>

After breakfast we arranged to go out hunting. Some<br/>
of the gentlemen proposed to scour the country north of<br/>
the camp, and the Grand Duke and I, with a party of the<br/>
hunting Bedouins of this district-handsome, wild-looking<br/>
fellows-were to hunt the wild boar in the direction of the<br/>
Jordan.<br/>
