<span>OUR NEW SHEIK. <span style="color: #ff0000;">M</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">?<br/>

<br/>
</span>a red-legged cock partridge and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">stark </span>which was making<br/>
for its sleeping-place. Thousands of these long-billed<br/>
creatures came past our camp, and as many as could find<br/>
place settled on the low trees to rest. At sunset we all<br/>
returned to dine. As I fell asleep I heard close by the<br/>
tents the howl of hungry jackals.<br/>
<br/>
Early on the 8th of April the servants struck the tents<br/>
and the caravan was again in motion. At first we had to<br/>
retrace the weary way through the side valley. In the<br/>
main valley things went better, and after a two hours' ride,<br/>
galloping along the good steppe ground at the foot of the<br/>
hills, we came to a marshy depression. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Some </span>scattered<br/>
clumps of bush and, unfortunately for us, a somewhat too<br/>
extensive morass marked the spot as hunting ground.<br/>
Salim and his agile allies were already there, but as his<br/>
circuit terminated here, another party of Bedouins were<br/>
awaiting our arrival, led by a very handsome sheik and<br/>
followed by many large dogs. The footmen were clad like.<br/>
Salim's people, but their leader seemed of a wealthier class.<br/>
His good chestnut caparisoned in rich trappings indicated<br/>
this, as well as his gay apparel, large coloured turban,<br/>
embroidered morocco slippers, and handsome Turkish<br/>
scimitar. His whole appearance bore the stamp of the<br/>
tribes of the interior of Asia rather than that of the pure<br/>
Arab.<br/>
<br/>
He escorted the Grand Duke, Hoyos, and myself with<br/>
marked urbanity to our posts on the opposite side of<br/>
the thicket of reeds. The other gentlemen, with the<br/>
rest of the caravan, meanwhile pursued their further<br/>
march.<br/>
