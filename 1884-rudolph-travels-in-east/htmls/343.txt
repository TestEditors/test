<span>A CLOUD OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">FLAMiNGOES</span>. 215<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
whole surface is overgrown with thick dark-green tamarisk<br/>
bushes. The shores are flat and sandy, and in some places<br/>
clay comes to the surface. Feathers lie about everywhere<br/>
--the down of the great pelican and of the rosy flamingo,<br/>
together with that of the most various <span style="color: #0000FF;">w</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ater-fowl</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Some islands, especially those which are surrounded<br/>
by large sand-banks, seem to be completely plastered over<br/>
with thick layers of guano, and in the clay one can see<br/>
the footprints of all kinds of marsh and water birds. At<br/>
one place I also found the track of an ichneumon. After<br/>
our brief but successful sport we continued our voyage<br/>
eastward.<br/>
<br/>
We wished this day to get as far as the region of the<br/>
flamingoes, and, in fact, we soon saw between the islands a<br/>
long rosy bank of this singular creature. It was a lovely<br/>
sight. A narrow tongue of land had to be crossed; so we<br/>
stopped the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiy√©</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">urged </span>the other gentlemen, as<br/>
the afternoon was already far gone, to disperse among <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>islands, and to meet at this point for night quarters.<br/>
<br/>
Our small boat was drawn across the island, to approach<br/>
the flock of birds from the opposite bank. When we had<br/>
got within about four hundred paces of them, unrest and<br/>
movement began to show itself among the flamingoes, who<br/>
had hitherto stood motionless. Thereupon we gave them<br/>
the first volley. Forthwith a marvellous rosy cloud sailed<br/>
upwards into the far distance. One specimen was left<br/>
behind, half standing, half swimming in the water. We saw<br/>
with the glass that the bird was wounded, and, glad to get<br/>
it, had ourselves rowed towards it<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>As the boat drew <span style="color: #ff0000;">near<br/>
<br/>
</span>the wounded bird began to beat its wings, and, fluttering<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
