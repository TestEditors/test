<span>80 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
across the smiling fields and the grey-green shrubs on the<br/>
shore to the broad mirrored lake of Birket-el-Karun, and<br/>
beyond it to the long orange outline of the desert of<br/>
Sahara.<br/>
<br/>
An eagle buzzard, a bird of African race, stood on a low<br/>
hillock not far from our line of march. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">jumped </span>off my<br/>
horse and crept up to him, but failed with too weak shot.<br/>
The confiding bird only came nearer to me, and I fired<br/>
again, but once more without success; this only moved him<br/>
to flutter still closer, and so it went on till the fourth shot,<br/>
despite the inadequate loading, laid him low.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after this brief interlude, we came to a miserable<br/>
poverty-stricken village. Low and, for the most part,<br/>
ruinous clay huts were unworthy of the splendid accessories<br/>
of towering palms and wide-spreading <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores</span>. The<br/>
inhabitants came out in airy garments and the children in<br/>
entire nakedness to look at us. The road turned at the<br/>
village, and soon brought us to the shore of the lake.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as all the horses and beasts of burden were<br/>
unladen, we got into boats. They were, in truth, sorry<br/>
craft; worse one could not imagine in the days of our ancestors and their lake-dwellings. The square, <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>boxes were<br/>
slowly propelled by five or six strong fellows with oars of<br/>
the most primitive description. The inside was full of old<br/>
fishbones, and the stench of filth of various kinds, and in<br/>
particular of putrefying fish, was so strong that nothing but<br/>
incessant smoking could even partially protect us.<br/>
<br/>
The fishermen in old Egyptian times probably used no<br/>
other, and certainly no worse, boats than their brethren <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>to-day use on the Birket-el-Karun<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
