the stifling air of the Valley of the Jordan makes itself felt.<br/>

We walked back with our Arab to the castle. Arrived<br/>
there, he was plentifully supplied with meat and <span style="color: #0000FF;">frink</span>, and<br/>
at the same time <span style="color: #ff0000;">depriired </span>of liberty in a <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-barricaded<br/>
</span>room for twelve hours. We too made a very good supper,<br/>
served by the count's men in the costume of the country;<br/>
and then I hurried back to my <span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena </span>station. Night had<br/>
fallen in the interval, and, unluckily, heavy clouds made<br/>
the country additionally dark.<br/>
<br/>
Hodek was crouching in the shed, and told me that soon<br/>
after sundown some jackals had appeared. With stony<br/>
patience we lay in the ambush till midnight, but we soon<br/>
realized the hopelessness of the case, as the place where<br/>
the dead ass lay could scarcely be seen. Had the ground<br/>
been smooth rock or desert sand, as in Egypt, my prospects would have been better; but here, as everywhere<br/>
near Jerusalem, big rocks and stone lay about with dark<br/>
grass between. We were, moreover, enduring real torture<br/>
in the close, narrow berth. The wind was good for sport,<br/>
and blew direct from the carrion towards us, bringing us<br/>
the" most fearful <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours </span>through the firing-holes. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Some</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>times we thought we heard the wild beasts creeping up,<br/>
and several times people passed in the road singing, and<br/>
the watchdogs at the castle howled piteously in true Eastern<br/>
fashion. At midnight, as I have said, my patience was<br/>
exhausted, and we groped our way carefully back to the<br/>
castle.<br/>
<br/>
On the Ist of April I was called at sunrise, and went<br/>
out to see the effect of the strychnine. Our <span style="color: #0000FF;">astonishment<br/>
