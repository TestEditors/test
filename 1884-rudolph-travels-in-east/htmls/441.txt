after the other to kiss the sacred spot. We followed their<br/>
example, and were in so doing lavishly sprinkled with<br/>
consecrated rose-water by their priest. The orthodox<br/>
chapel was hung with black, for an hour later Mass was<br/>
to be said for the poor deceased Czar Alexander II.<br/>
<br/>
We left the church after service, and went through<br/>
several streets to the convent for women founded by the<br/>
well-known priest, Father Ratisbonne. The church<br/>
which belongs to it stands on the place Ecce Homo, and<br/>
has no special interest; it is a new building, in French<br/>
taste, dazzlingly white, and not solemn or impressive.<br/>
It looked very like the Protestant places of worship.<br/>
The girls' school attached to the convent is a really noble<br/>
institution, for which the worthy priest deserves great<br/>
credit. This institution, which is clean and very well<br/>
arranged, provides instruction for rich and poor children,<br/>
mostly Christians, but the tolerant priest allows Jewish<br/>
and Mohammedan girls to share the blessings of.<br/>
education.<br/>
<br/>
From the platform of the house we had a splendid<br/>
view of the Mount of Olives and the country round the<br/>
Holy City. In the parlour we had to drink the usual<br/>
lemonade, and then went on to the adjacent Chapel of<br/>
the Scourging. After sundry raps at a decaying door,<br/>
the keeper of this holy place opened for us. He was<br/>
an aged and neglected looking Franciscan, born in Spain.<br/>
He led us through a ruined court into the little chapel.<br/>
It was built in 1839, and has therefore no interest.<br/>
Beneath the altar is the hole in which the column of the<br/>
