<span>94 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I had a free line of fire to the shore. This point made the<br/>
natural boundary of the first beat.<br/>
<br/>
On our way through the sand we had occasion to<br/>
examine many different tracks <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>footprints. It appears<br/>
that the beasts of prey from the desert come nightly to the<br/>
shore to drink, and probably to surprise the sleeping waterfowl.<br/>
<br/>
There was track upon track; those of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena</span>, beside<br/>
that of the wolf; jackals, the fox of the desert; the lines<br/>
also which the great lizards draw, and the broad trail of<br/>
the dismal spectacle-snake, were not lacking in the fine<br/>
sand. I had hardly reached my post when the dogs, in<br/>
the distance it is true, began to hunt. The drive was<br/>
rapid, and the loud yelping approached my quarter.<br/>
<br/>
Suddenly there appeared, close to the sandy <span style="color: #0000FF;">shore</span>,<br/>
a long, grey, shaggy beast, with a pointed head and a long<br/>
shapeless, slender tail, going at a quick trot. A successful<br/>
shot laid it low. An ichneumon, a thoroughly African and<br/>
very ugly animal which bears no resemblance, either in<br/>
appearance or habits, to any of our European beasts of<br/>
prey, lay before me. The dogs soon followed on the<br/>
track. The piece of bush had been beaten, and we<br/>
resolved to take a similar and adjacent piece. Our second<br/>
attempt met unfortunately with no success.<br/>
<br/>
Camel tracks in the sand showed us that a tribe of<br/>
Bedouins were in the neighbourhood, and, in fact, we<br/>
soon observed that several camels were browsing in the<br/>
underwood, heard the yelping of their dogs, and saw from<br/>
afar some dark figures <span style="color: #ff0000;">approach- </span>an encampment. I have<br/>
been told that the wild tribes in these parts are very poor,<br/>
