the foot of the Mokattam mountains (of so-called <span style="color: #ff0000;">numulite<br/>
</span>limestone). The isolated' Red Mountain' (Gebel Ahmar)<br/>
rises dark red in colour. This mountain is of silicious<br/>
sandstone, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>is much quarried for making mill-stones,<br/>
and in <span style="color: #0000FF;">antiquity </span>supplied the most durable material for<br/>
statues and monuments of all kinds. The two famous<br/>
colossal statues of Memnon on the west side of the great<br/>
Theban plain came from the'Red Mountain.'<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>. On the right hand follow each other in unbroken succession the tombs and mosques of the Caliphs, the pumping<br/>
station of the Cairene Water Company, the modern tombs<br/>
of deceased Moslems; the desert residence of the last<br/>
Viceroy but one, the old castle of the Viceroy Abbas<br/>
Pasha-a modern ruin in the fullest sense of the word;<br/>
barracks for cavalry and infantry; lastly, fountains and<br/>
other small structures of no importance. To the left are<br/>
the rich plantations of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Schubra </span>Avenue, and nearer to<br/>
the road a palace belonging to the mother of the Khedive<br/>
Ismail Pasha, and the grounds of the meteorological and<br/>
astronomical observatories.<br/>
<br/>
"A shady road perfumed with flowers, with vineyards<br/>
and fruit gardens on either side, leads, a little further on, to<br/>
the villa of the present Khedive, hard by the village of<br/>
Kubbe.<br/>
<br/>
"The flourishing plantations stand on the soil of the<br/>
desert, and seem to have been called to life, as it were, by<br/>
magic. But they confirm by their presence what Napoleon<br/>
so truly remarked, at the time of his stay in Egypt,' If the<br/>
desert comes to the Nile, indigence and want follow; but if<br/>
the Nile comes to the desert, riches and well-being spring<br/>
