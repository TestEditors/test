and national music. It was a thoroughly patriotic festival,<br/>
held far from our dear home, in another quarter of the<br/>
globe.<br/>
<br/>
At the close of the ceremony we drove direct to the<br/>
Khedive, to take leave of him and tender our thanks. He<br/>
quickly returned the visit at Kasr-en-Nusha, and accompanied us to the railway. We left our castle in the<br/>
Shubra Avenue with sorrow, and drove sadly through the<br/>
streets.<br/>
<br/>
A battalion of infantry stood on the open ground in<br/>
front of the station, presenting arms when our national air<br/>
was played. Many of our country people were on the<br/>
steps, with Egyptian <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials</span>, Brugsch Pasha, the brothers<br/>
Saurma, and Prince Taxis. We took leave of the Viceroy,<br/>
to whose unremitting courtesy we owed so much, and of all<br/>
our friends, and the train moved slowly out of the station.<br/>
It was painful to look our last on the beautiful City of the<br/>
Caliphs, the steep cliffs of Mokattam, the lofty citadel, and<br/>
the magic of the Pyramids. We were bound for new regions<br/>
and other lands.<br/>
<br/>
We travelled by the same line as a few days before.<br/>
First we passed through cultivated land, with towns, many<br/>
of which have the charm of historical association; for<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">example-shibi1n-el-Kan2tir</span>, a modern Arab town, near<br/>
which, on the so-called <span style="color: #ff0000;">TeII-el-Yehndiye</span>, or Jewish Hill, a<br/>
fortified town stood in the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries before our era, and in which, under the government<br/>
of Ptolemy Philometor, a Jewish temple was erected by the<br/>
high priest Onias, for his country people who had been<br/>
driven out of Palestine. Further on is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bilb√©s </span>(old Egyptian<br/>
