<span>88 TRAVELS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>THE EAST<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>Here we were then, like Robinson Crusoe, cut off from<br/>
all the world and confined to this little island. In our<br/>
camp our huntsmen set up a very pretty and singular <span style="color: #0000FF;">display</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>From the cords of the tents they hung the game<br/>
we had caught. Two lynx, the skin of yesterday's wolf,<br/>
Pausinger's pelican, and two eagles, looked right well. Our<br/>
skin-dresser had his hands full and worked well and<br/>
quickly.<br/>
<br/>
After a sumptuous luncheon, which our excellent Hassan<br/>
served to us, we smoked pleasantly outside the tents,<br/>
enjoying the glorious life of an Eastern camp, until<br/>
suddenly I discovered that the northern point of the<br/>
island, the level between the shore and the rock, was<br/>
covered with birds of all kinds. With the glass I could<br/>
see flocks of herons, pelicans, gulls, and among them some<br/>
river eagles.<br/>
<br/>
I crept as best I could along the shore, under cover,<br/>
towards the half-sleeping, brooding company. I had nearly<br/>
reached them when, to my dismay, I saw two pelicans<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">swimming </span>about on the lake as sentries. On two sides<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">J </span>.had <span style="color: #ff0000;">no </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.cover</span>. It was all up: the crafty birds had<br/>
already spied me, and rose. That was the signal for the<br/>
multitude on land, and with noisy flapping of wings<br/>
the company dispersed in wild disorder in every possible<br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
Only the inquisitive gulls wanted to know what the<br/>
cause was, and floated over me screeching. To my great<br/>
delight I discovered, among many smaller birds, one of the<br/>
large brown-headed fishing-gulls, a fine and to me new<br/>
species. <span style="color: #ff0000;">-A </span>successful shot brought it into my bag<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
