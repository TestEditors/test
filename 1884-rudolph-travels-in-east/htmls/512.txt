<br/>
formation of these water-courses is interesting. Hemmed<br/>
in on each side by vertical broken banks some fathoms<br/>
deep, they present a spectacle of wild confusion. In the<br/>
middle <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bows </span>a brook-at this time of year only a narrow<br/>
one; around it lie a medley of rocks, marshy places, thick,<br/>
and in fact impenetrable, bushes, trees, decaying trunks,<br/>
mould and ruins of all kinds-a primeval forest in a<br/>
narrow space. In the broadest part the distance from one<br/>
bank to another does not exceed two hundred paces.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the guns were now to go to the right, others to<br/>
the left or upper side of the clay bank, while the Bedouins<br/>
with their dogs were to keep on the same level and beat<br/>
the bushes and rocks in line. Salim remained beside me<br/>
and directed the whole of the chase.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst continuous howling and hurling of stones the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters </span>sprang and leaped about in the brook. The shots<br/>
cracked merrily as one bird after another flew up, soon to<br/>
fall heavily back into the bushes. Red-legged and rock<br/>
partridges, quails, and singing birds of many kinds flew out<br/>
from their hiding-places. In the broken banks rollers and<br/>
bee-eaters had their nests. In the marshy places we found<br/>
tracks of wild boar and <span style="color: #ff0000;">porcupine-wills</span>, too, of this last,<br/>
and its burrow. Unluckily this shy animal creeps underground at the slightest sound, and is therefore very seldom<br/>
captured by day.<br/>
<br/>
We had been shooting for some time, and had gone over<br/>
a considerable stretch of the bank, when suddenly the<br/>
dogs gave tongue in an almost impenetrable thicket. I was<br/>
searching for a rock partridge, and was therefore, fortunately,<br/>
at the bottom of the valley. At this moment a shot came<br/>
