<br/>
</span>morsels, also poisoned, had to be laid round the principal<br/>
bait, as most animals have the habit of tasting small scraps<br/>
before they address themselves to the larger task<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>These<br/>
disgusting preparations were just completed, and we were<br/>
arranging the firing-holes in the ambush, when an Arab<br/>
appeared with a long gun and offered his services. He<br/>
was most anxious to accompany us at night to our station,<br/>
gave us much good advice, and recounted all his triumphs<br/>
in hyaena hunts. It was difficult to reduce him to silence.<br/>
As it was not nearly time yet to keep watch, we resolved to<br/>
return to the castle, and take the Arab with us. We feared<br/>
if we dismissed him that he would in revenge destroy our<br/>
station. Ferdinand knew him as an untrustworthy man,<br/>
who lived by partridge shooting and vagabondizing about<br/>
Bethlehem. His sly, deceitful face confirmed this view,<br/>
and I resolved to make him harmless <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>this one night.<br/>
<br/>
I left the young guide to keep an eye on the ambush<br/>
till our return. The sun was setting, gilding Tantur, <span style="color: #ff0000;">the</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>picturesquely placed town of Bethlehem, and the mountains<br/>
of the Valley of the Jordan with magical hues. An afterglow, reminding us of our Alps, was reflected from the<br/>
lofty, barren steeps of the mountains beyond the Dead<br/>
Sea. The sky was covered with vaporous, fleecy clouds,<br/>
and a cool breeze swept across the plateau.<br/>
<br/>
The temperature of the neighbourhood of Jerusalem<br/>
and of the line of mountains on the coast between Bethlehem and the sea is not to be compared to the mild, equable<br/>
delicious air of Egypt. Rough winds remind one of the<br/>
high level of the bare plateau, and snowstorms in March<br/>
are not of rare occurrence. At Bethlehem, a league east<br/>
