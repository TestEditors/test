<span>292 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

Sepulchre by the street known as the Via Dolorosa. A<br/>
great number of Catholic pilgrims had assembled there,<br/>
and we all received lighted tapers, and, with the Franciscans at our head, moved in procession from one sacred<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">spot </span>to another, singing as we went. At the appointed<br/>
places of devotion we knelt, repeating the prescribed<br/>
prayers. This round lasted for an hour. The dark church<br/>
dimly lighted with torches, the low monotonous chants,<br/>
and the powerful incense, all produce a mystical effect on<br/>
the spirit. Throngs of pilgrims daily take part in the<br/>
procession, to which extensive indulgences are attached.<br/>
<br/>
We returned to our camp to mount our horses and ride<br/>
round the city. In the glorious evening light we rode past<br/>
the kings' tombs and the grave of Absolom; saw the field of<br/>

<br/>
The twilight drew <span style="color: #ff0000;">on/and </span>drinking in with enjoyment<br/>
these great impressions, we rode slowly back beneath the<br/>
old walls to our camp.<br/>
<br/>
On the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gist </span>of March our whole party went from<br/>
the camp to the Church of the Sepulchre to hear Mass<br/>
in a side chapel. The custode of Terra Santa awaited'us<br/>
at the portal, and led by him we went upstairs into a<br/>
dark chapel, where there were two altars separated by a<br/>
lattice. One, plain and simple, belongs to the Latins;<br/>
the other, showy with silver and gilding, is Greek. The<br/>
first is on the spot where Mary stood at the Crucifixion;<br/>
the second bears the name of Golgotha. The bare rock<br/>
shows beneath the Greek altar, and during the Latin<br/>
Mass many pilgrims, chiefly Russian peasants, came one<br/>
