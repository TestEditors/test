<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kubbet-erSachrii</span>, stands in its centre, with a lofty<br/>
cupola, pillared vestibule, and a beautiful octagon hall-one<br/>
of the most renowned of Eastern edifices. Various <span style="color: #ff0000;">small</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>half-ruined monuments and wells stand between the chief<br/>
mosque and the buildings which abut on the enclosing<br/>
wall. The chief of these is the very beautiful <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mesdjid-elAksa</span>, a church built in the reign of the Emperor Justinian,<br/>
in honour of the Virgin, and afterwards appropriated by<br/>
Omar to the Mohammedans.<br/>
<br/>
We were shown round by the chief dervish, an elderly<br/>
and capable-looking Mohammedan in bright apparel. The<br/>
population in Palestine, as in all other Asiatic Mohammedan<br/>
countries, is far more fanatical than in Egypt; and travellers<br/>
must be on their guard in no <span style="color: #0000FF;">way </span>to wound their feelings.<br/>
We went over both mosques carefully. In the centre of<br/>
the great octagon there is a huge block of stone, around<br/>
which the temple has been built. This rock may vouch<br/>
for the great uniformity of Eastern legends, and the Jews<br/>
also venerate it. The Talmud mentions it, and Hebrew<br/>
tradition teaches that Abraham and Melchisedek sacrificed<br/>
here; that here Abraham was about to slay Isaac, and<br/>
that Jacob also consecrated it. The ark of the covenant<br/>
stood here; and here the Jews believe it still remains,<br/>
having been hidden by Jeremiah. This rock is believed<br/>
to be the centre of the world. The same opinion is also<br/>
held of the Church of the Sepulchre, where the spot is<br/>
indicated by a small stone.<br/>
<br/>
It is an interesting fact that the great mosque stands on<br/>
the site of the Temple of Solomon, and the Moslems adopted<br/>
all the Hebrew traditions, and added them to their own<br/>
