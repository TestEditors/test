<span>266 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

its creed and its existence as a race. Old Abraham is not<br/>
dead; the industrious acquisitive Hebrew of antiquity lives<br/>

Semitic families who remain in the old home continue in<br/>
the ancient way.<br/>

In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppes </span>along the Jordan, Sheik Ali dwells with<br/>
his thousands of horsemen, free and uncontrolled. Flocks,<br/>
herds, horses, and women are his wealth; wisdom and the<br/>
books of his faith, his strength; a people by themselves,<br/>
with their aged nomad king at their head, just such as<br/>
those of whom Holy Writ tells us. In the East nothing<br/>
dies. The feverish revolutions of the West go by and leave<br/>
no trace; everything is as it was in remote ages, and will<br/>
so continue as long as the primeval sun rises daily,<br/>
purpling the bare hills, the orange desert, and the green<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">steppes </span>of the East-gilding the glorious land, the cradle<br/>

Turkish, and also those of the ancient Hebrews, are to be<br/>
seen. The blue fellaheen shirt and the brown hood are<br/>
no longer visible in the streets, any more than the white<br/>
burnous; nor do we, as in Egypt, see scantily arrayed or<br/>
well-nigh unclad men<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
