<span>32 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
plough, and half-naked brown fellaheen are busy at the<br/>
water-wheels. Women, in scanty blue skirts, leading naked<br/>
children, step beside the proud caravans of camels. Bedouin families on their passage across the cultivated land,<br/>
from one desert to another, on foot and on horse, the women<br/>
on camels-a diminutive people, but proud and independent.<br/>
Pure Arabs, white burnous, fine horses, long guns, scimitars,<br/>
turbans, and simple fellaheen caps; long-haired goats<br/>
and wolf-like dogs; tawny half-starved donkeys of the<br/>
peasant, beside the well-fed white or black <span style="color: #ff0000;">riding'asses </span>of<br/>
the rich; a cavalcade of well-to-do people, the men in garish<br/>
garments on horseback, the women on camels in painted<br/>
tower-like erections, which screen them from the eyes of<br/>
the unworthy. The fields swarm with white gulls, which<br/>
follow the ploughman, and nimble peewits. Among the<br/>
bushes on the banks the red palm doves coo, and the longbilled fishing gulls mew--most genuine Egyptian creatures.<br/>
At the sight of the train, a wolf scuds across the fields,<br/>
and kites in number, falcons, and vultures hover over the<br/>
villages.<br/>
<br/>
A varied, animated, and interesting display of human<br/>
activity and of animal life, veiled in the grey blue mists of<br/>
the midday heat-thus old Egypt meets the traveller's view.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Damanhthr</span>, a genuine little Arab town, is left far behind;<br/>
and, constantly on the watch and drinking in each new<br/>
impression, we traverse the plain. We reach the Nile.<br/>
The train rattles across the iron bridge, and for the first<br/>
time we greet the dark majestic flow of this oldest of<br/>
historic rivers. On the right bank we run through <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>station of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kaffr-ez-Zayat</span>, a small town lying hard by<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
