<br/>
We came out on the open place and went to the outer<br/>
wall. It descends vertically into a deep, rocky ravine.<br/>
Here there is a splendid view across the high <span style="color: #0000FF;">table-land </span>to<br/>
the mountains of Jordan and the Dead Sea. The Golden<br/>
Gate in the wall attracted our attention. Jewish legends<br/>
from the life of Christ are told about it, and the Mohammedans have filled it up with stones and rubbish; for,<br/>
according to their belief, this is the gate by which a fair<br/>
king shall perchance one day come from the west, and,<br/>
entering in to the court of the Mosque of Omar, put an<br/>
end to their rule.<br/>

We left this most interesting spot after a long visit. It<br/>
is the place where the old Jewish temple stood, the palace<br/>
of Solomon, the centre of radiance of the highly civilized<br/>
Hebrew kingdom. Here, too, in later time, Christ taught,<br/>
and many records of <span style="color: #ff0000;">H </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">is </span>deeds and of the doctrines of our.<br/>
faith are connected with it. Later still the victorious<br/>
Romans entered here, massacring the Jews. Here stood<br/>
the Temple of Jupiter, and under Justinian a Byzantine<br/>
Christian church. Last of all came Islam, and made it<br/>
a vast mosque, in which in our own day the doctrines and<br/>
myths of the three great religions mingle strangely, and<br/>
point us to their common Eastern birth.<br/>
<br/>
The Mosque of Omar bade us also remember Raphael's<br/>
famous picture of the marriage of the Virgin.<br/>
<br/>
Passing along the Wailing-Place of the Jews, where<br/>
they still go to deplore their lost kingdom and the ruins of<br/>
their temple, we crossed the city to the Church of the<br/>
