abandon it, but in the meantime we had found an interesting relic. In the funnel of a burrow a Protestant hymnbook was discovered, probably carried thither by the inmate,<br/>
after the fashion of many animals that burrow. Here, at<br/>
any rate, were the genuine evangelic psalms and hymns,<br/>
and the prayer for the Emperor William<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On the whole,<br/>
the volume was in good condition, outside as well as in;<br/>
only a few stains of blood on the paper. God only knows<br/>
how this European book came into this savage spot, and<br/>
how its owner lost it; perchance his bones may be bleaching<br/>
hard by in the impenetrable thicket.<br/>
<br/>
We mounted our horses and rode home. Salim<br/>
went in front at a hand gallop. He sat without saddle<br/>
or horse-cloth on the bare back of a small roan, guiding<br/>
the frisky creature with a rope fastened to it only on<br/>
one side.<br/>
<br/>
Close to Jericho I noticed a "Jean le blanc" eagle<br/>
washing in the brook. I crept up to him under cover of the<br/>
overhanging bank, and in a few minutes had the splendid<br/>
specimen in my bag.<br/>
<br/>
The other gentlemen had also shot a considerable<br/>
quantity of smaller game, and a regular show was set<br/>
up when we had all reached the camp. After this we<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">breakfasted</span>. Unhappily the meal consisted rather in driving<br/>
away the flies than in eating. It is difficult to form an<br/>
idea of the throng of insects that attacked our food. We<br/>
passed the hottest hours in camp, seeking rest<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The<br/>
terrible heat unhappily made this a prolonged torture, and<br/>
it was difficult even to collect one's thoughts so far as to jot<br/>
down the necessary notes and to write some letters home.<br/>
