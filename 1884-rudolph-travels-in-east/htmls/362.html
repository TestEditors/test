<br/>
<br/>
firmament, and only the ceaseless bark of dogs and the cry<br/>
of the water-fowl as they went to the Nile- broke the<br/>
grandeur of its repose.<br/>
<br/>
The town was lively enough, and we had to push our<br/>
way through restless crowds to reach Kasr-en-Nusha.<br/>
<br/>
We drove early next morning to the great barracks of<br/>
Kasr-el-Nil, and went on board the steamer Feruz, which'<br/>
lay <span style="color: #0000FF;">below-our </span>good old ship, associated with the glorious<br/>
memories of the happy plains of Upper Egypt. The<br/>
brown admiral again commanded his good boat, and in a<br/>
few minutes we were in motion down stream.<br/>
<br/>
One learns first justly to estimate the richness of colour<br/>
and the imposing aspect of nature in Upper Egypt when<br/>
one has returned from it to revisit Cairo and Lower<br/>
Egypt. These, which on first arriving were so enchanting,<br/>
now look colourless and pale to eyes which have beheld<br/>
yet greater charms.<br/>
<br/>
Our excursion on this day was to the famous "barrage<br/>
du Nil." We first passed old houses leading down to the<br/>
water; next came the expanse of water itself, where several<br/>
vice-regal yachts lay side by side with the mail steamers<br/>
and a vast <span style="color: #ff0000;">fleet </span>of <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiy√©</span>. On the left bank stand<br/>
country houses with luxuriant gardens; on the right, the<br/>
town, the Shubra Avenue, the castle of the same name, and<br/>
the tall trees of the great park. These interesting scenes<br/>
soon disappeared, and the monotonous cultivated province<br/>
of Lower Egypt could be seen across the low and broken<br/>
banks of the stream<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>We saw some solitary wild geese and a great number<br/>
of ducks. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">waterfowl </span>were otherwise but <span style="color: #0000FF;">sparingly<br/>
<br/>
