voice, during which he bowed repeatedly in different<br/>
directions, his disciples following his example. When<br/>
this was at an end the music suddenly broke out wildly.<br/>
The instruments were the same which we had heard in the<br/>
bee-dance in Upper Egypt, only that the copper tamtam<br/>
and the fiddle, which is not unlike our Dalmatian "gusla,"<br/>
played a greater part. The melody was wild and<br/>
warlike.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">At </span>the first notes the men stepped into the circle,<br/>
and bowing once more to the old priest began to turn.<br/>
None touched the other, and each remained in his own<br/>
. place. At first they moved slowly, but then <span style="color: #0000FF;">over </span>quicker,<br/>
till the long skirts stood out almost level. The music<br/>
grew rushing and wild, and their faces more excited.<br/>
They <span style="color: #0000FF;">hummed </span>like <span style="color: #ff0000;">pegtops </span>round on one spot, both<br/>
hands stretched apart, the one closed and the back turned<br/>
upward, the other open showing the palm. This signifies<br/>

implores the gifts of God.<br/>
<br/>
Looking on makes one dizzy, and European blood<br/>
runs cold at such sights. This height of fanaticism is<br/>
appalling. Without moving an iota, in the same attitude<br/>
these people turn with incredible rapidity. Their features<br/>
are convulsed, the eyes turn out; the thin hands, and<br/>
pallid cheeks set in their short beards, cut in Turkish<br/>
fashion, betray all the painful signs of nerves disordered<br/>
by depraved religious feelings. An old man in a dress<br/>
like that of the squatting high priest crept in among the<br/>
turning dervishes, regulating their movements. These<br/>
first devotions lasted a long time. Then the <span style="color: #0000FF;">music<br/>
