it had brought the entire ass-mot dragged it along, but<br/>
carried it on its back. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hyaenas </span>are very large and strong,<br/>
but they are not, in my opinion, capable of doing so much<br/>
as this; neither are they accustomed to carry off their booty<br/>
without touching it. Those are the ways of the bear, and<br/>
I feel convinced that a yellow Syrian Isabel-bear, which<br/>
Brehm, in his "Animal World," says are met with in Palestine, played us this trick. Had it been full moon we should<br/>
have had a splendid night<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>So, vexed, and out of humour, I<br/>
went back to breakfast at the castle. It was very lively on<br/>
the road. Caravans of asses and camels laden with provisions came in from the country to the market in Jerusalem,<br/>
and one saw varied costumes as well as interesting types<br/>
both of men and women.<br/>
<br/>
Our luggage and the whole column of beasts of burden,<br/>
with Mr. Howard conducting, soon appeared from the<br/>
sacred Zion, where the camp had broken up in the morning. They passed the castle, and went forward to pitch<br/>
our camp for the next night below Bethlehem. The<br/>
gentlemen were to spend the forenoon in Jerusalem, and<br/>
would not arrive at Tantur before noon. I employed the<br/>
spare time in watching at the ambush for large birds of prey.<br/>
The head of the ass had in the meantime been dragged<br/>
up to the shed, and I had plans for employing poison the<br/>
next night with those last remains of our splendid jackass.<br/>
<br/>
Storks were passing in great numbers from south to<br/>
north, and soon the daily troop of vultures followed. They<br/>
come from the mountains of the Dead Sea to the towns,<br/>
and especially to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jerusalem</span>, to gather up the carrion.<br/>
Hundreds of vultures, one after the other, and some <span style="color: #ff0000;">eagles<br/>
