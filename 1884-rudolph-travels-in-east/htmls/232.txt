<span style="color: #0000FF;">l </span>The whole arrangement of the temple is carried out<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tin </span>the plan already described, and thus affords to the<br/>
modern spectator the most faithful picture of temple<br/>
buildings in the ancient Egyptian times.<br/>
<br/>
.<span style="color: #0000FF;">'This </span>vast shrine was dedicated to Horus, the god of<br/>
Light, the Egyptian Apollo, whom the inscriptions more<br/>
precisely describe as the form of the Suri-god for<br/>
Upper Egypt. Represented with a hawk's head, the god<br/>
appears triumphing over darkness, symbolized under the<br/>
form of an untamed hippopotamus. The scenes depicted<br/>
on the inner side of the western boundary wall represent<br/>
the battles of the god of Light with darkness and evil, in<br/>
the moral sense, and recall in their order the well-known<br/>
twelve labours of Hercules of Greek fable. The richness<br/>
of the representations and of the inscriptions which clothe<br/>
all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>surfaces of the walls and pillars of this temple<br/>
exceed in the range of their contents all the other monuments of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">minuteness </span>of detail with which information is<br/>
given may fairly be called inexhaustible. It relates to<br/>
history, geography, ethnography, astronomy, <span style="color: #ff0000;">kalendars</span>,<br/>
architecture and mensuration, to the order of the service<br/>
of the temple, etc., <span style="color: #ff0000;">etc.</span>, and, quite apart from the fulness<br/>
of mythological tradition, would provide material for many<br/>
a'thick volume. The length of the temple at its boundary<br/>
wall is 433 feet 6 inches; the width of each wing, 100 feet<br/>
6 inches; and the height of each, 103 feet. <span style="color: #0000FF;">T<br/>
<br/>
</span>The court, with its peristyle supported on thirty-three<br/>
pillars, is picturesque and <span style="color: #0000FF;">imposing </span>in effect. The halls,<br/>
