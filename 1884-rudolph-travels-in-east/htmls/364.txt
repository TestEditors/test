<span>232 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We soon quitted this shooting ground and returned to<br/>
the steamer, where we breakfasted on our way home. The<br/>
black coffee was hardly swallowed and the cigarette smoked<br/>
ere we reached Kasr-el-Nil, and, taking our last farewell of<br/>
the beloved Feruz, went on shore.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Abd-el-Kader </span>Pasha, always unwearied in his kind<br/>
attentions, knew how much it would gratify me to see the<br/>
turning and howling dervishes, and as no Friday (the day<br/>
on which they perform their special devotions in the great<br/>
mosques) was at our disposal for Cairo, he obtained from<br/>
the Khedive an order for our admission into the convent of<br/>
these fanatics.<br/>

of the Arab quarter. The carriage stopped at a narrow<br/>
alley, and we climbed a steep ascent to a wall. On<br/>
entering the gate we found a simple little Cloister with<br/>
a garden. By a wretched wooden staircase, and a<br/>
gallery, we passed to the reception-room. Its walls were<br/>
plain and bare; three divans and some rugs were its only<br/>
decoration. Two young men whom we took for servants<br/>
had shown us up. In a few minutes the director of the<br/>
convent appeared-an old man broken down by fanatical<br/>
penance and mortification. His outer man was dismal<br/>
indeed: thin, pale, the colour of wax, like a corpse; his<br/>
sharp features, pallid lips, lifeless eyes, and bony hands,<br/>
and his bent carriage, as well as his hollow voice, were<br/>
ghastly and spectral. His dress consisted of long coloured<br/>
robes trimmed with fur, a bright sash, and a cloak which<br/>
dragged on the ground behind, and which, despite the<br/>
fearful heat, he held tightly together with <span style="color: #0000FF;">trembling<br/>
