seize the caliphate. But thus opposed, he had to content<br/>
himself with Egypt, and turned his whole care and energy<br/>
to this land.<br/>
<br/>
The citadel which Mehmet Ali built is the lasting<br/>
monument of his diabolical cruelty. He distrusted the<br/>
Mamelukes, who were serving in Egypt as a body of<br/>
mercenaries faithful to the Sultan. So one fine day, when<br/>
all were assembled in the courtyard of the citadel beside<br/>
the mosque, he ordered them to be massacred-all but one.<br/>
This one, a brave Turk, sprang in full armour on his bold<br/>
horse over the boundary wall of the platform, rushed down<br/>
the steep cliff, and lighted on the soft heaps of rubbish<br/>
below. The warrior and his faithful steed rose, saved as<br/>
by a miracle, and escaped the pursuit of the enraged Pasha.<br/>
<br/>
We saw this blood-stained ground, and looked from the<br/>
platform on the splendid view over the ancient City of the<br/>
Caliphs, with its houses and minarets, and far across the<br/>
cultivated land, through which the Nile winds like a silver<br/>
thread; beyond the green level the Pyramids rise, and<br/>
behind them the sparkling yellow sand of the boundless<br/>
desert. Behind, and immediately below us, the dark steeps<br/>
of the Mokattam mountains, and the wild confusion of the<br/>
tombs of the Caliphs and Mamelukes, and the ruins of<br/>
the old and <span style="color: #0000FF;">decaying </span>parts of the city, make an interesting<br/>
picture.<br/>
<br/>
The small vice-regal castle which adjoins the square is<br/>
simply arranged, and is only interesting as having been the<br/>
residence of Mehmet Ali. His room, even his bath, is<br/>
all kept in the same condition as when he inhabited the<br/>
building. Egyptians do well to cherish and reverence <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
