After the visit we wended our way back in the big carriages,<br/>
in slow procession, to Kasr-en-Nusha.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately after our return the Khedive arrived to<br/>
pay us his visit. When he had left the castle, the Grand<br/>
Duke and I received all the Austrian and Hungarian residents, the Consuls-General, and some other gentlemen who<br/>

cliffs of the Mokattam range. Windmills, old half-fallen<br/>
tombs, and ruins were the last buildings on the zone of sand.<br/>
<br/>
The road keeps on the luxuriant cultivated ground,<br/>
