<span>362 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nowhere in the Valley of the Jordan had we found <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>region at once so accentuated in line and form, and so poor<br/>
in vegetation, as that across which we journeyed in the<br/>
first hours of this day. A great number of birds of prey<br/>
were soaring in the air, and one imperial eagle flew so low<br/>
over my head, that I brought' him down with a shot, and he<br/>
fell among the horses with heavy flapping.<br/>
<br/>
We had next a toilsome climb up a projecting spur of<br/>
the mountains. On reaching the ridge a magnificent view<br/>
was spread before us. The Valley of the Jordan grows<br/>
broader, and one sees more and more of the plain up to<br/>
the hill country by Lake Tiberias; to the right and left<br/>
are the finely formed frontier mountains, and closing the<br/>
view to the north, the lofty summits of Lebanon and the<br/>
broad snow fields of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hermon-a </span>strange contrast. We<br/>
languished in the most terrible heat, such as only the Valley<br/>
of the Jordan suffers, and before us, in the far distance, the<br/>
crystal snow sparkled on the mountain top.<br/>
<br/>
At this interesting spot we halted for rest. We<br/>
determined that while the caravan pursued its long and<br/>
toilsome way, we would ride down to the Jordan and spend<br/>
some hours on the banks of the sacred stream. The<br/>
Bedouin, in his long flying mantle, and lance in hand, who<br/>
had led us well hitherto, frankly confessed that he did not<br/>
know the direct way down to the river, so we separated in<br/>
order to find the quickest way to the east. I galloped across<br/>
the steppe--had to clamber over some ravines, and thus<br/>
reached a spot where a little spring bubbled forth amongst<br/>
low rocks and a garden of luxuriant shrubs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Following the<br/>
course of the water along the higher margin of the rocks, I<br/>
