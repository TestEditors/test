<span>THE PILLAR OF POMPEY. 29<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
the half-savage dogs, buffaloes, and asses, and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">allpervading </span>yellow dust.<br/>
<br/>
Amidst the last houses of the town rises a round <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span>made hill, and on this stands the ancient Pompey's<br/>
Pillar, a monolith sixty-three feet in height, of the red<br/>
syenite of Assuan, and with a roughly worked Corinthian<br/>
capital at its summit. In ancient times it bore the statue<br/>
of the Emperor Diocletian.<br/>
<br/>
We came at a favourable moment and enjoyed a<br/>
splendid view from the hill. The town lay outspread<br/>
before us in golden light, to the north the open sea, and to<br/>
the south-east the yellow dunes and Lake Mareotis.<br/>
<br/>
The sun was setting; its disc appeared in the warm,<br/>
thick air as on many a misty day with us-the western sky<br/>
tinted with the richest orange, red, blue, all sharply defined<br/>
and the whole bathed in golden light, while the eastern<br/>
heavens were already veiled in the blue shades of night<br/>
and here and there bright stars looked through. Only the <span style="color: #0000FF;">A<br/>
</span>East, and above all Egypt, famous for its lights and<br/>
shadows, can summon up such magical effects.<br/>
<br/>
Whilst we were in the full enjoyment of the prospect<br/>
from the hill, noisy crowds were passing through the streets<br/>
at its base. First came <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rocks </span>of black goats with their<br/>
hanging ears, then a string of camels: they were going<br/>
to their night quarters, accompanied by the yelling guides.<br/>
Next followed a funeral. Men bore the coffin, a wooden<br/>
box without a cover, with a cloth thrown over; at' the<br/>
head a turban cut in wood told that a man was being<br/>
borne to his last rest. Several hired mourners surrounded<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffin </span>wringing their hands and wailing aloud. A number<br/>
<br/>
