<br/>
through the desolate ravine, closely bounded by the glaring<br/>
white mountains, to the kings' tombs at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Biban-eI-Moluk</span>,<br/>
where, in a <span style="color: #ff0000;">cal </span>de sac of steeply falling slopes and cliffs,<br/>
valley and path alike terminate, and the dark chasm<br/>
opens which leads down into the sepulchres of the earliest<br/>
dynasties. Armed with torches we entered those shrines<br/>
of a buried past.<br/>
<br/>
I am indebted to Brugsch Pasha for many valuable<br/>
notes respecting this spot; so I will now allow him to<br/>
speak. tt The kings' tombs of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Biban-el-Moluk </span>are in a<br/>
side valley of the mountain, on which Nature herself seems<br/>
to have impressed the stillness of death. Here lay, buried<br/>
in deep caverns, the successive generations of the most<br/>
famous kings of the Theban dynasties, from the eighteenth<br/>
downward. The grave of Seti I., a true temple of the dead,<br/>
chiselled out of the rock, is reckoned the finest amongst<br/>
these remarkable structures. Steps, which descend with<br/>
perceptible tracks for the carriage of the sarcophagus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">lead</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>into the dark depths, from passage to passage, from chamber<br/>
to chamber, which, in spite of all the inroads of decay, still<br/>
display pictures and inscriptions in the most perfect colours.<br/>
By the dim light we <span style="color: #0000FF;">follow </span>the long series of scenes, which<br/>
take us into the realms of the dead in the world beyond,<br/>
and bring the different regions of the lower world before<br/>
our eyes, depict the joys of the blessed in paradise, the<br/>
torments of the damned, the starry heavens, and the subterranean voyage of the vessel of the sun in its course from<br/>
west to east, from death to <span style="color: #0000FF;">life</span>, through night and darkness; in a word, unroll for us in picture or <span style="color: #0000FF;">I</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>word,<br/>
with the utmost detail, the mysterious pages of life beyond<br/>
<br/>
