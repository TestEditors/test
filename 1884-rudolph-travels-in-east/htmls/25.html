bore witness to the truth of his statement. Soon, soon we<br/>
should rejoice in other glorious palms, in the abiding summer<br/>
of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
Adelsberg rose from amidst deep snow, and the last<br/>
dark pine woods made a beautiful winter picture. A clear<br/>
sky gave us a distant view from Karst <span style="color: #0000FF;">towards </span>the Alps.<br/>
There was snow everywhere: at Nabresina, even, there<br/>
were still some white patches; but towards the south<br/>
glowed a different light-a richer blue and warmer sunbeams-the first greeting of the sunny South. Below us<br/>
lay the sea-majestic, calm, smooth as the mirror of a<br/>
mountain <span style="color: #0000FF;">tarn-not </span>the grey ocean which I had so lately<br/>
seen, but the glorious, warm, blue Adriatic. Two of my<br/>
companions saw this grand element of nature for the<br/>
first time in their lives, and gazed on it with admiring<br/>
wonder.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped at the station of Miramar, and drove to<br/>
the little harbour. The castle, finely placed on the rocks<br/>
above the surging waters and amidst evergreen southern<br/>
vegetation, was a most picturesque object. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ear </span>it lay the<br/>
ship which bore the same name-an old friend, for I had<br/>
already made two voyages in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar-and </span>at sight<br/>
of her, pleasant memories rose dreamlike before me.<br/>
<br/>
A boat waited at the steps and took us quickly to the<br/>
ship. At the gangway stood the commander, <span style="color: #ff0000;">L</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">S. </span>Captain<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Riidiger</span>, and to the sound of the National Hymn we went<br/>
on deck, and passed in review the ship's company there<br/>
drawn up. The other officers were Lieut. Count Chorinsky<br/>
(with whom I had formerly made my Spanish journey),<br/>
and in addition Hahn, Sachs, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Resnicek</span>. Dr. Hirsch,<br/>
