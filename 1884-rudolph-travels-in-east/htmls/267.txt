</span>The night was fine, and I proposed to fire at nothing<br/>
less than a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena</span>, to wait till they came, and therefore to<br/>
remain out far into the night. Several jackals appeared,<br/>
but were left unmolested. As midnight drew near, and I<br/>
was already having a sore struggle with sleep, I saw,<br/>
thanks to the clear moonlight, some human beings creep<br/>
by not far from my ambush, and heard immediately after<br/>
several shots, and the familiar cackle of the unlucky decoy<br/>
fowl.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ow </span>that the absolute stillness required while watching<br/>
for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hysena </span>was at an end, instead of waiting uselessly I<br/>
went home, meeting by the way the dragoman <span style="color: #ff0000;">Paulowich</span>,<br/>
who had unfortunately been with Baron Seckendorf to the<br/>
same spot as I. Hoyos at his post, which lay close to the<br/>
town, had killed one jackal and wounded another. The<br/>
Grand Duke, as well as <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eschenbacher</span>, had been at one time<br/>
literally surrounded by howling jackals, but owing to the<br/>
awkward lie of the ground had been unable to fire. As I.<br/>
returned at midnight I had a lovely view of the picturesque<br/>
town of Assuan, the river, and the fairy land of the<br/>
Elephantine Island, all in a magic flood of purest moonlight.<br/>
<br/>
At eight <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>on the ninth of March the steamer<br/>
left Assuan, that delightful and thoroughly central African<br/>
town, ethnographically so full of interest. We glided down<br/>
the stream with the greatest rapidity, through scenes now<br/>
well known. The hours on deck went quickly by, and the<br/>
return voyage afforded the desired opportunity of arranging<br/>
at our <span style="color: #0000FF;">writing-tables </span>the notes we had collected, and committing to paper our recollections of travel<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>At noon we were<br/>
sitting in the cabin, when the steamer stopped suddenly and<br/>
