hands. He wore a high green felt cap with a green<br/>
ribbon twisted round, the colour of the Prophet. This<br/>
marvellous headdress is like that of the Persians.<br/>
<br/>
With ceremonious politeness he pointed us to a seat,<br/>
and placed himself stiffly on a divan, as though he were<br/>
a wax figure. Servants brought coffee in dirty cups and<br/>
cigarettes.<br/>

step and folded arms, bowing profoundly to the squatting<br/>
priest. They then ranged themselves round the wall<br/>
of the arena.<br/>
