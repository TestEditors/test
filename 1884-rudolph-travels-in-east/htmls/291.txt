majesty of this god said to Thot,'Behold! great is the<br/>
distance from heaven, where I have set up my throne, and<br/>
where I must dwell to dispense the light of the sun. Thou<br/>
glorious god, in the deep, and in the world of tombs,<br/>

</span>for the dog-headed ape<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>and this the origin of his office as<br/>
leader of armies<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Be </span>thou, therefore, my representative<br/>
for all visible things that through thee may be manifested,<br/>
and all men shall praise thee as God.'<br/>
