"The few remains of antiquity which are still extant on<br/>
the much and oft-traversed ground of this sacred spot<br/>
belong to <span style="color: #0000FF;">edifices </span>of later times; temples by the erection of<br/>
which certain individual kings of Theban origin sought to<br/>
give proof of their pious sympathy for the ancient sanctuary of the kingdom. Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">II.</span>, the adoptive father of<br/>
Moses, also called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sestura </span>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. the Sesostris of classical<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">tradition</span>), born 1350 B.C., stands at the head of these royal<br/>
founders. The remains of the buildings initiated by him,<br/>
which are partly extensions of older<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>ruined temples, and<br/>
partly special buildings in their neighbourhood, now lie<br/>
scattered over the ground. His own statue, of colossal<br/>
size, which once stood before the gate of the great Ptah<br/>
temple, one of the masterpieces of Egyptian sculpture,<br/>
worked in fine marble-like limestone, now lies overthrown<br/>
in a pit which the Nile water fills to the brim at its annual<br/>
overflow<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>"The features of this famous Pharaoh vividly recall those<br/>
of his <span style="color: #0000FF;">portrait</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-the </span>fine statue in the museum at Turin.<br/>
The numerous fragments which lie around the statue of<br/>
Ramses, and which bear the names of his successors, and<br/>
in particular that of his son, the next king, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mineptah </span>(the<br/>
Pharaoh of the exodus of the Jews), show that these kings<br/>
paid due homage by dedicating gifts of all kinds to the<br/>
supreme divinity of the earliest Egyptian history.<br/>
<br/>
"A'sacred bull, the Apis (old Egyptian Hapu), was<br/>
. dedicated to the same god Ptah as his living embodiment,<br/>
and was kept beside the great temple, in one of its outer<br/>
courts, tended with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">utmost </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">care</span>, and worshipped. On<br/>
each occasion of the death of the sacred bull its <span style="color: #0000FF;">solemn<br/>
