by a richly gilt partition into two. Various blackened<br/>
pictures of saints, glittering ornaments, and some Greek<br/>
inscriptions are on the walls. On the terrace in front of<br/>
the church, flowering <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruit-trees </span>gladden the eyes of the<br/>
winter-weary northerner. The view from the island towards<br/>
Corfu and the sea is enchanting; a <span style="color: #0000FF;">fitting </span>home for<br/>
visionary hermits.<br/>
<br/>
The poor monks, however, had no look of thought or<br/>
devotion, but rather one of complete stupefaction from the<br/>
monotony of their life. The younger is a lover of cats, and<br/>
several half-starved specimens, mewing pitifully, followed<br/>
his steps. The opposite island has on it a building with a<br/>
tower, inhabited by a solitary recluse. After a brief visit<br/>

at our first attempt to approach.<br/>

</span>everything, so that sport in these countries is a very<br/>
uncertain pleasure. After long endeavour I succeeded in<br/>
bringing down a small cormorant, and content with this we<br/>
set our faces homeward.<br/>
<br/>
A beautiful view of the verdant coast of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benizza</span>,<br/>
and the lofty Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hagioi </span>Decca, consoled us for our<br/>
unsuccessful sport. We soon rejoined the Miramar.<br/>
It began to grow dark, the coaling was completed, and,<br/>
dinner over, we started once more. A bad night was <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
</span>follow on our tranquil day.<br/>
