beautiful faces. There was no small sprinkling of a <span style="color: #0000FF;">demi<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">monde </span>of the same stamp as in Vienna or Pesth. In<br/>
Egypt this class is recruited in great part from Austria, as<br/>
I was told. The garden of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gine'net-en-Nusha </span>has the<br/>
luxuriant, almost tropical character of Egyptian gardens;<br/>
spicy <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours </span>fill the air and the flowery vegetation delights<br/>
the eye of the foreigner. A military band played merry<br/>
tunes, and many European-clad people walked in the<br/>
shaded paths.<br/>
<br/>
We drove rapidly through the grounds, and paid a visit<br/>
to the handsomest of the country houses round-the villa<br/>
of the wealthy Greek, Antoniadis. The well-kept garden<br/>
and the lavish abundance of the African climate unite art<br/>
and nature in happy blending. The house itself is beautifully arranged, and the utmost skill directed to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">maintenance </span>of a cool temperature. The owner showed us over<br/>
it with courteous kindness. <span style="color: #0000FF;">o<br/>
<br/>
</span>We drove back'towards the town through the avenue<br/>
by the canal, and then turning inland reached the famous<br/>
Pillar of Pompey outside and beyond it.<br/>
<br/>
The way which we took interested me. I found in it<br/>
much that recalled home scenes. The outskirts of all<br/>
Oriental towns and those of the eastern parts of Europe<br/>
have the same character stamped on them. The houses<br/>
grow ever smaller, and the most elegant of cities terminates<br/>
in neglected gardens between nameless heaps of rubbish and<br/>
filth, beside tumble-down buildings and deserted graveyards.<br/>
<br/>
Here the type was even more distinctly marked by<br/>
ruinous tombs, those small circular buildings with cupolas,<br/>
the dwindled palm-trees, the heavy-laden camels resting,<br/>
<br/>
