<br/>
arrived from Tantur, fine large specimens, which had<br/>
poisoned themselves in the night with the same head of<br/>
the ass.<br/>
<br/>
Some Bedouins from the mountains on the south-western<br/>
margin of the Dead Sea came into the camp-fine, manly<br/>
fellows, with noble faces, muscular and powerful, and with<br/>
rather dark skins. They were members of poor but wild<br/>
and quite lawless tribes. One of them, probably the sheik,<br/>
wore a party-coloured turban, a full white robe, yellow<br/>
shoes, and, fastened to his waist, a large bent Turkish sabre.<br/>
The expression of his face, his thin features, sharply defined<br/>
mouth, round which a derisive smile played, and his piercing<br/>
black eyes did not inspire confidence.<br/>
<br/>
These Bedouins, thorough Arabs in their habits and<br/>
appearance, and wholly different from the more Hebraic<br/>
natives of Bethlehem, had come to offer to sell me three<br/>
young ibex kids, which I purchased. They also wished to<br/>
induce us to make a hunting expedition among their barren<br/>
hills, where the Arabian ibex, a fine creature with <span style="color: #ff0000;">long</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>gristly horns, is found in great quantities. The excursion<br/>
was, alas! out of the question, for it would have detained<br/>
us for several days and led us along the shore of the Dead<br/>
Sea to its south-western point, and our time was already all<br/>
laid out. I was therefore compelled, though with a heavy<br/>
heart, to send back these dark children of the steppe to<br/>
their home, consoling them with a backsheesh.<br/>
<br/>
The camp was, as usual, struck with extraordinary<br/>
speed, and under Mr. Howard's guidance the great caravan<br/>
moved towards Mar-Saba. We rode once more up to<br/>
Bethlehem, where the chaplain said Mass. We took leave<br/>
