These people differed much in appearance from the<br/>
true Bedouin type. To me they seemed dark-complexioned<br/>
Jews. Figure, countenance, and carriage were entirely<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Israelitish</span>, and involuntarily one thought of the posterity<br/>
of Hagar cast out into the desert of Arabia, and which<br/>
had become<span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the predatory <span style="color: #ff0000;">huntinglshmaelite</span>. Thus in the<br/>
most mythical forms of the traditions of early Oriental<br/>
history there lies a germ of fact of the highest importance.<br/>
<br/>
From a bare hill near the springs we got a fine distant<br/>
view across the dazzling white Arabian desert, with its<br/>
stony ridges and valleys, southwards to the high mountains<br/>
of Sinai, and to the west across the Red Sea to the African<br/>
Mount Ataka. Heavy clouds were in the sky, and gave to<br/>
the gloomy scene a still sterner aspect.<br/>
<br/>
After a short stay we returned to the coast, and looked<br/>
for some time for shells on the sandy shore. The Red Sea<br/>
is famed for its richness in shells, and in a few minutes we<br/>
found an incredible number of beautiful specimens. Time<br/>
pressed, and we had soon to return to our steamer, on<br/>
which we passed Suez and entered the canal. Here as<br/>
elsewhere we had on each side the dreary banks of the<br/>
canal, with occasionally a glimpse of the equally dreary<br/>
desert. To describe the Suez Canal would be an unprofitable task, so I prefer to let Brugsch Pasha once more<br/>
speak, as one who can enliven with historical reminiscences<br/>
the gloomy landscape.<br/>
