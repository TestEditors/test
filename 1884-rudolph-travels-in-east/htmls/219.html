<span>THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">ABABDEHS</span>. 127<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
race, who in the earliest days of migration-those of the<br/>
Kushites--<span style="color: #0000FF;">took </span>the southern line in these wanderings of<br/>
nations, and, following the coast of the Indian Ocean and<br/>
the southern frontier of Arabia, arrived in Africa. These<br/>
remarkable clans settled in Abyssinia and beyond it, in the<br/>
territory of the Somals, and up to Assuan, and even Thebes.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ababdehs </span>in particular form even now a rigidly<br/>
separated class, which inhabits the mountains east of the<br/>
Nile, between the river and the Red Sea, beginning at<br/>
Thebes and extending southwards beyond Assuan.<br/>
They are a poor mountain people, who live in the wild<br/>
ravines of the desert mountains, and have maintained their<br/>
type unchanged, remaining at the very lowest stage of<br/>
development.<br/>
<br/>
They are savages, untamed, in the full sense of the<br/>
word. The copper-coloured skin, the slender figure, and<br/>
the delicate features tell of their Indian origin. Their hair<br/>
is black, but disfigured by greasy unguents and plaiting<br/>
into various horned points supported on pieces of wood, to<br/>
such a degree that it is impossible to detect its original<br/>
character. Their clothing consists of some dirty, scanty<br/>
rags wound closely round the body.<br/>
<br/>
They all wore roughly made ear and arm rings, indeed<br/>
one little boy had a nose ring. Their arms, old swords--among them a European blade, a knightly weapon from<br/>
the times of the Crusaders-wooden clubs, primitive<br/>
javelins, leather shields, arrows, bows and quivers, claimed<br/>
special attention; but they would not readily sell any of<br/>
them, and it needed the intervention of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abd-el-Kader<br/>
</span>Pasha to procure the whole lot for me.<br/>
