<span>350 TRAVELS IN <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At midday in the Valley of the Jordan we enjoyed daily the<br/>
agreeable temperature of 1220 <span style="color: #ff0000;">F </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ahr</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Towards five in the afternoon I set forth again<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>this<br/>
time accompanied only by Salim and some Bedouins. At<br/>
first I shot cooing doves among the trees; then we roamed<br/>
across some wild oat fields, where I shot a plentiful supply<br/>
of quail for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">larder-a </span>matter of necessity, for our stores<br/>
began to smell somewhat badly, and the much-vaunted<br/>
preserved meats in particular spread an evil exhalation<br/>
throughout the camp. Sauntering by bush and grove, I<br/>
could not but remark the glorious vegetation of this region.<br/>
I specially noted the Zizyphus <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lotus </span>and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Spina </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Clwisii</span>,<br/>
from the fruits of which are made the well-known jujubes<br/>
so dear to Europeans afflicted with a cough; and also the<br/>
Balsam tree, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Solanum </span>sanctum. The famous rose of<br/>
Jericho is only found, and that but scantily, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">shores<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.of </span>the Dead Sea. At sunset I returned to the camp, where<br/>
we dined and went to rest.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning the whole camp broke up before<br/>
sunrise; the tents were struck, and, with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wonted<br/>
</span>clamour and cries, the caravan got into motion. We<br/>
followed soon after breakfast, led by a Bedouin with long<br/>
lance and flying mantle and riding a beautiful chestnut.<br/>
He might have posed for the model of a genuine Arab.<br/>
The sheik who had hitherto acted as guide had been dismissed by the Pasha for reasons unknown to me. At first<br/>
we rode at the foot of the border hills on the verge of<br/>
vegetation. We passed among thick shrubs and under<br/>
low trees which were literally covered with storks awaking<br/>
from sleep. After a while the bushes disappeared, the wild<br/>
