<br/>
<br/>
displayed their skill; Arab music, serpent-charmers, <span style="color: #ff0000;">fireeaters</span>, story-tellers, negroes, Nubians, clowns from the<br/>
north coast of Africa, magic lanterns, and puppet theatres<br/>
with Eastern get up, were all exhibited. In a word, it was<br/>
a regular fair, with all the artists of this class in which the<br/>
East is so rich.<br/>
<br/>
The garden gates had unluckily been opened too early,<br/>
and such a crowd had streamed in that it was impossible<br/>
to move about freely.<br/>
<br/>
We got into a regular crush, and it was only by the<br/>
help of some Dalmatians in full dress, who made a living<br/>
wall round us, that we succeeded in reaching the gate and<br/>
carriages that stood outside. We were soon at <span style="color: #0000FF;">home</span>, and<br/>
after our busy day repose was doubly welcome.<br/>
<br/>
Next morning we drove through great part of the<br/>
European city on our way to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bulak </span>Museum, on the<br/>
southern point of the island of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bulak</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The museum is one of the richest and most famous<br/>
collections of Egyptian antiquities, and in the spacious-well,<br/>
arranged buildings are stored the priceless treasures of the<br/>
ancient times of the Pharaohs. A Frenchman is director,<br/>
the successor of the well-known but lately deceased<br/>
Mariette Pasha. The brother of the great Egyptologist,<br/>
Brugsch Pasha, has also a post here, and pointed out to us<br/>
the most interesting parts of the collection. To describe<br/>
the Museum of Bulak would demand, on the one hand,<br/>
extensive scientific acquirements, and on the other it has<br/>
already been treated of piece by piece in numerous special<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">treatises</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>. We looked at everything carefully in the rooms, as well<br/>
