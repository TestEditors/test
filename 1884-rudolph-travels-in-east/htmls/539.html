dragged themselves painfully along, urged by blows from<br/>
their conductors. The effect of the great heat, the forced<br/>
marches from Latrun before we reached Jerusalem, and<br/>
the recent want of water were very perceptible; almost<br/>
all the mules had sore backs from the weight of the<br/>
luggage, and broken knees.<br/>
<br/>
After a ride of several hours I reached the entrance<br/>
of the valley of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Abd-el-Kader</span>, which runs in a northwesterly direction between high mountains. As usual<br/>
a brook purled down its centre, and the banks were<br/>
covered with a more than usually abundant vegetation,<br/>
which followed the course of the stream across the plain<br/>
down to the Jordan. As the brook could only be ridden<br/>
across at one point, we were obliged to ride far into<br/>
the interior of the valley on its southern bank, and then<br/>
to retrace our steps for the same distance on the northern<br/>
side, to where the valley opened into the great plain, and<br/>
where, beneath a peculiar cone of rock at the border of.<br/>
vegetation, our camp was to be pitched.<br/>
<br/>
The gentlemen had already arrived, but the caravans<br/>
were still a long way off, and so we had the pleasure of<br/>
waiting the arrival of the pack-horses in a little hollow<br/>
which afforded shade. Some of us employed this time<br/>
in searching for a bathing-place. The whole brook was<br/>
so filled with succulent plants of more than man's height,<br/>
and oleander trees thickly covered with large red flowers<br/>
of aromatic perfume, that one could scarcely reach the<br/>
water. Moreover, the whole ai.r of the place had so<br/>
completely the look of a southern lair of serpents, and I<br/>
have such a respectful regard for the poisonous reptiles<br/>
