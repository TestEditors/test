<span>RIDE TO MOUNT TABOR. <span style="color: #0000FF;">371<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>take part in the solemnities of Holy Week up to Easter<br/>
Monday. In order to escape from the fever we now<br/>
resolved to pass the next night on the summit of Mount<br/>
Tabor and next day to travel thence to Haifa, to<br/>
which place the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miea</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mar </span>was forthwith to be summoned from Beyrout, where she lay at anchor. We had<br/>
thus a long journey before us, and set forth immediately<br/>
after breakfast. I could hardly sit my horse from <span style="color: #0000FF;">languor</span>,<br/>
and it will be <span style="color: #0000FF;">long </span>ere I forget this ride. We had, moreover, to pass through a most uninteresting country in the<br/>
scorching heat. The steppe-like character of the Valley of<br/>
the Jordan had given place to long level ridges and interminable valleys. Stony flats with scanty bush alternated<br/>
with ill-cultivated land. We passed herds of camels and<br/>
goats. The country of the Bedouins lay behind us. The<br/>
population here was more variously clad-in a more<br/>
northerly and, if I may say so, more Asiatic fashion than <span style="color: #0000FF;">at</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Jaffa. We observed many big turbans, gay burnous, <span style="color: #ff0000;">furtrimmed </span>jackets, and most singular red shoes.<br/>
<br/>
The journey was very tedious, as the invalids could only<br/>
travel at <span style="color: #ff0000;">a </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">foot </span>pace. Our sole consolation was the outlook<br/>
beyond our miserable surroundings to the beautiful mountains. At length we reached the foot of the steep and<br/>
solitary Tabor, standing isolated from all other hills. Its<br/>
slopes, to the summit, are covered with slabs of rock, loose<br/>
stones, and dwarfed oaks. The road winds up the side,<br/>
through a miserable little village, consisting of stone cabins<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>It is almost incomprehensible how the horses manage to<br/>
get up. Among the rocks evergreen shrubs grow, and the<br/>
low knotted oaks offer no attractive picture<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The type of<br/>
<br/>
