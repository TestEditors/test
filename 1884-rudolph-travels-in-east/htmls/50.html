bare, and rugged mountains. We passed several solitary<br/>
farmhouses and small villages.<br/>
<br/>
The road was the reverse of lonely. The peasants,<br/>
some on foot, but mostly on small miserable-looking<br/>
donkeys, or on two-wheeled carts, brought their produce<br/>
to the town. I looked well at them. They seem a somewhat diminutive race, with dark skin and hair. Their<br/>
costume is neither becoming nor bright. Wide trousers,<br/>
the feet in shoes, like our Dalmatian slippers, and on the<br/>
head small caps or great broad-brimmed hats. Many<br/>
carried long single-barrelled guns.<br/>
<br/>
After a two hours' drive the road approached the<br/>
mountains. The hills on the right end in a marshy<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Iagune</span>, and in the distance sparkle the blue waters of the<br/>
Adriatic.<br/>
<br/>
The mountains on the left meet the coast in a vertical<br/>
wall of rock, and the road ends at a village built in steps<br/>
up the slope of the mountain side. The high mountains<br/>
which one now has close at hand are on this side perfectly<br/>
bare-steep cliffs and great masses of boulder, without any<br/>
vegetation. From the village we made our way on foot<br/>
round the base of the lofty cliff, between it and the sea.<br/>
We soon reached the northern point of the island, and had<br/>
a splendid view; Cephalonia lay to the north; directly in<br/>
front of us was the basin of a narrow valley planted with a<br/>
forest of oaks, and in the midst stood a convent half hidden<br/>
between the two hills.<br/>
<br/>
We went over the convent chapel, which was richly<br/>
adorned with gilded reliquaries and the black pictures of<br/>
saints. It appeared to be a favoured resort of pilgrims<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
