<br/>
so grand and magnificent in its loneliness, is a wonderful<br/>
thing.<br/>
<br/>
In a-moment we had stepped across the limit of the<br/>
inundation of the Nile and passed suddenly from the<br/>
abundant teeming vegetation, evoked by its beneficent<br/>
irrigation, such as only the Dark Continent can bring forth,<br/>
into the dead stillness of the lifeless desert.<br/>
<br/>
Whoever thinks of the desert as flat and a dead level,<br/>
like many Hungarian reed swamps, or a <span style="color: #0000FF;">matsh </span>of North<br/>
Germany, is much mistaken. The desert is wavelike and<br/>
varied, often deeply indented, crossed by valleys and<br/>
crowned by hills; yet always solitary, without the smallest<br/>
trace of plant life, and only inhabited on its extreme verge<br/>
by quite peculiar forms of animal life adapted to it.<br/>
<br/>
But the desert shows itself to the traveller as great and<br/>
beautiful, an image of unbroken rest and withal rich in<br/>
colour, and glowing from the burning sun of Africa. The<br/>
colours are due to the various stones, which are often pale.<br/>
yellow, then again dark, and sometimes streaked or piebald; the variety of stones evokes the most magical combinations of colours.<br/>

We saw nothing living as the train rattled swiftly<br/>
across the waste. Some Bedouins in white burnous, with<br/>
long guns, came from behind a hill. Genuine Berbers<br/>
dwell in this part of the desert, free sons of the earth, in<br/>
their way the happiest of men; brave, predatory, uncontrolled, and insubordinate in the highest degree. The<br/>
different tribes differ greatly in appearance and costume,<br/>
and also in their characteristic qualities, and in their arms;<br/>
but Egypt, as regards the beauty and picturesque bearing of<br/>
