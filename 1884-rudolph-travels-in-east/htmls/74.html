<span>34 <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRAVELS </span>IN THE EAST<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>in front, in the midday haze, as though veiled in orange<br/>
grey, are the Pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghiz√©h</span>. It is a solemn moment,<br/>
and unbidden thoughts of grave import <span style="color: #0000FF;">-fill </span>the mind of the<br/>
traveller, who sees for the first time with his own eyes<br/>
these tokens of a civilization which <span style="color: #0000FF;">flourished </span>in long-past<br/>
"ages, in this everlasting land of the Pharaohs, which is the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">corner-stone </span>of the history of the world.<br/>
<br/>
To the south-east the table-like desert mountains of<br/>
Mokattam rise in masses. Below them are the walls of the<br/>
citadel and the minarets of the mosque of Mehmet Ali.<br/>
Between <span style="color: #ff0000;">alLthese</span>, in the hot mist, lies the sea of houses of<br/>
the chief city of Africa. The nearer we approach to the<br/>
ancient, much-praised city of the Caliph, the more luxuriant<br/>
are the gardens beside the railway. Forests of palms and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores </span>surround isolated houses, and at length the dark<br/>
green of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Schubra </span>Avenue opens on our view. In a few<br/>
minutes the train enters the station.<br/>
<br/>
The Viceroy, surrounded by his <span style="color: #0000FF;">officers </span>of state, stood<br/>
on the steps with most <span style="color: #0000FF;">friendly </span>greetings.<br/>
<br/>
The numerous members of the large Austro-Hungarian<br/>
colony received their countrymen with resounding ovations.<br/>
We went to the carriages in waiting-handsome thoroughly<br/>
European <span style="color: #0000FF;">equipages</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>battalion of infantry playing the<br/>
National Hymn in our honour. The first sight of life in<br/>
Cairo is enchanting. We drove through a short street to<br/>
the bridge which crosses the canal, and into <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>rich green<br/>
of the shady <span style="color: #ff0000;">Schubra </span>Avenue. One picture follows another,<br/>
and as in a dream the most bewitching scenes pass before<br/>
the eye. Crowds of human beings move to and fro; <span style="color: #ff0000;">heavyladen </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Camels</span>, small asses, noisy Orientals in coloured.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
