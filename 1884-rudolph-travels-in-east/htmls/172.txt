directions, and only our guides and donkey-drivers went<br/>
with us.<br/>
<br/>
One of the latter seems in his leisure hours to follow the<br/>
craft, so favoured by the Egyptians, of serpent-charming,<br/>
for on the march he drew out of a leather pouch which he<br/>
carried hidden under .his wide robe, two very large and<br/>
imposing-looking spectacle serpents which he had captured<br/>
the day before near the lake. He of course performed the<br/>
familiar trick of breathing on the serpents, whereupon they<br/>
lie stiff and as though dead. In a few minutes, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">muchtormented </span>creatures, who have been rendered harmless by<br/>
the extraction of their fangs, recover and creep back again<br/>
into the brown pouch. As we were riding at foot's pace,<br/>
the dachshunds ran beside the horses, but when the<br/>
caravan approached a small and wretched village, adorned<br/>
only by some extremely fine palms and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores</span>, the<br/>
eager dachshunds disappeared into an insignificant square<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">bean-field</span>, and forthwith began a lively hunt. We jumped<br/>
from our horses and surrounded the field, which could be<br/>
shot across from one side to the other. In this narrow<br/>
space the hunt went up and down for a quarter of an hour.<br/>
Twice the ichneumon put its head out close beside a gun,<br/>
but no one could fire because of his neighbour. The<br/>
cunning beast knew his danger, let himself be driven up<br/>
and down by the dogs, but never left his secure cover.<br/>
<br/>
As time pressed, we had to whip the dogs in and<br/>
continue our journey, without having done what we wished.<br/>
<br/>
The road led us past a <span style="color: #0000FF;">railway</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">b. </span>short branch line,<br/>
which leads for purposes of transport from the factory at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Abuskar </span>to the principal sugar-cane plantations.<br/>
