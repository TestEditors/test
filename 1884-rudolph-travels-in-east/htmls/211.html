Let us quote the words of Brugsch Pasha, who guided<br/>
us with learning and taste through those most wondrous<br/>
remains of long-forgotten <span style="color: #0000FF;">times-the </span>glorious ruins of<br/>
Karnak.<br/>
<br/>
"The temple of Karnak, formerly joined to Luxor by a<br/>
Sphinx avenue of extraordinary length, is a grand whole,<br/>
consisting of buildings of various epochs of Egyptian<br/>
history. Every king almost, within a period of seventeen<br/>
hundred years, felt it incumbent upon him to immortalize<br/>
himself by a building of his own. In this wise the history<br/>
of the empire for all these centuries is embodied in this<br/>
imperial temple. The most eminent founders of these<br/>
buildings were the following Pharaohs :--<span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">(</span>r) Thotmosis III.<br/>
and his sister <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hatchop </span>(circa'1600 mc.), to <span style="color: #0000FF;">whom</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>existing obelisks of Karnak owe their existence. The<br/>
victorious campaigns of the first-named in Asia and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Africa<br/>
</span>are commemorated in rich drawings and inscriptions,<br/>
and to these science owes <span style="color: #ff0000;">_important </span>information <span style="color: #0000FF;">respecting </span>the history and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the.ge</span>? graphical knowledge of<br/>
