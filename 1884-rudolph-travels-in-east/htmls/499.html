clay. To our right we saw a plain which extends to the<br/>
thickly grown meadows of the Jordan, and to our left, below<br/>
a large fall of earth, a marshy depression filled with almost<br/>
impenetrable thickets of reeds and briars.<br/>
<br/>
A big wild boar doubled just in front of the horsemen<br/>
by one of these thickly grown patches. The moment I<br/>
caught sight of the huge creature I jumped from my horse<br/>
and followed its track; going round the clump of bushes,<br/>
which was only a few hundred paces in circumference,<br/>
I found proof that the beast had not yet passed through.<br/>
I posted the gentlemen quickly and got the gendarmes<br/>
to drive. It soon became clear to us how hard it is to get<br/>
an animal out of an impenetrable mass of brambles, reeds,<br/>
and grass, even when that mass is but small in itself. All<br/>
our efforts were vain. We tried setting it on fire, but only<br/>
the grassy parts burnt up, sending gigantic columns of smoke<br/>
into the air. The innermost thicket, with the full sap of<br/>
spring, did not so much as crackle, and afforded a secure<br/>
hiding-place for the game. It was a pity that we failed, for<br/>
all the game from the <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppes</span>, barren mountains, and rocks<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">betakes </span>itself to these splendid luxuriant thickets of the<br/>
Valley of the Jordan, which are unapproached by man, and<br/>
there it remains. The tracks which we found in the moist<br/>
clay told of the wealth of animal life in this spot. Within<br/>
a narrow space I saw the tracks of several wild boars,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaenas</span>, wolves, jackals, of the Asiatic panther, the lynx,<br/>
and smaller beasts of prey which I was unable to distinguish. Two wild geese and several strand-runners flew<br/>
up from a water pool, and a flock of pelicans and one<br/>
inquisitive osprey floated in the clouds of smoke.<br/>
