<span>66 <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRAVELS </span>IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
among the murmuring palms and the thick sycamores.<br/>
Delicious <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours </span>were <span style="color: #0000FF;">waited </span>from the shrubs and the<br/>
fruit-laden orange groves-the intoxicating perfume of<br/>
Eastern vegetation. Countless stars filled the heavens,<br/>
and the warm soft air was enchanting <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the poor European.<br/>
It was a true African night in its full splendour. One<br/>
must have known the delicious magic of those happy lands<br/>
to understand their indescribable charm and boundless<br/>
attraction, and the yearning after them which lays hold of<br/>
every one who has ever lived in them. Only there, in<br/>
the smiling flowery East and its undying summer, could<br/>
the cradle of humanity have been <span style="color: #0000FF;">placed</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">nol </span>in the<br/>
bleak, gloomy, frosty <span style="color: #0000FF;">North</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">f<br/>

</span>A good road leads from Kub to Cairo, and we quickly<br/>
reached Kasr-en-Nusha, where our dinner and a night's<br/>
rest prepared us for the next day.<br/>
<br/>
On the 22nd, we started in the morning with Baron<br/>
Saurma, to drive through part of the European town and up<br/>
along the Muski to the point where the carriage road ends<br/>
at the last house, and the waste and dreary domain of the<br/>
old tombs begins. The broad, stony desert region <span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
</span>Cairo and the steep cliffs of the Mokattam mountains is<br/>
filled by what one may call a city of ancient funereal'<br/>
mosques and Mussulman graves of all kinds. A similar<br/>
colony of the dead exists also on the further side of the<br/>
citadel, but those, the graves of the' Mamelukes, are much<br/>
less worth a visit.<br/>
<br/>
Among the many smaller and greater mosques of the<br/>
graves of the Caliphs, the most noteworthy is <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gama </span>Kait-'<br/>
Bey, a fairly well preserved edifice with a richly decorated<br/>
