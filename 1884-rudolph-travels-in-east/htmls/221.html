<br/>
</span>my great joy, that a jackal was my prey. With this<br/>
valuable booty we soon reached the place where the asses<br/>
were waiting, and trotted back to our steamer very<br/>
contentedly.<br/>
<br/>
Following the advice of Chalil, some of us started<br/>
next morning, long before sunrise, and rode across country<br/>
past the ruins of Karnak, to a pond where the great beasts<br/>
of prey are wont to drink daily at twilight.<br/>
<br/>
The way was long and the stillness of death reigned in<br/>
the vast <span style="color: #0000FF;">pai-one </span>now and then the howl of jackals or<br/>
the bark of the half-savage dogs <span style="color: #0000FF;">broke </span>the stillness of the<br/>
night. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>At last we reached the pond, or, to describe it more<br/>
truly, the water left behind in a ditch by the overflow of<br/>
the Nile. Chalil placed the guns quickly, and we watched<br/>
with the <span style="color: #ff0000;">keenest </span>attention until the sun rose golden red<br/>
over the Arabian Nile. Nothing had been seen <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>one<br/>
jackal, which Herr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rath </span>had let slip.<br/>
<br/>
The brief transition from night, through twilight, to<br/>
sunrise was rich in variety of effect and glow of colour,<br/>
with a magic which only the interior of Africa can display.<br/>
<br/>
Many birds of all kinds came to water, and so we<br/>
resolved to pass the forenoon in sport. We killed plenty<br/>
of small game, amongst them several kinds of quail, a great<br/>
abundance of which find winter quarters here. Rambling<br/>
over the fields we reached the ruins of Karnak. Several<br/>
of the gentlemen now returned to Luxor, while I remained<br/>
behind, choosing an ambush among the ruins to watch<br/>
near carrion for the great vulture. Unfortunately, only kite<br/>
and carrion vultures appeared, at which I would not fire.<br/>
