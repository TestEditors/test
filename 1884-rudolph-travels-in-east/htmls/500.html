<br/>
</span>The pelicans came suddenly along from the Dead<br/>
Sea, crowded round the fire for a few minutes, saluted by<br/>
fruitless shots, and then departed, flying heavily up the<br/>
valley northwards. As time was short, I left this spot and<br/>
galloped without intermission along splendid ground over<br/>
sandy stretches and grassy heath, between the thick<br/>
shrubs, little groups of small low <span style="color: #0000FF;">trees-one </span>might almost<br/>
have called them miniature forests-and across some<br/>
mountain streams with broken banks, big stones, and<br/>
abundant growth of plants, hastening to the Jordan, until<br/>
we came to the village of Jericho.<br/>
<br/>
The Jericho of the present day consists of some wretched<br/>
huts inhabited by <span style="color: #ff0000;">iniserable </span>people, perishing from the<br/>
climate, and in ill repute because of their marked propensity to theft. Hedges protected by thick, long thorns<br/>
surround the village. A tower rises as the last remains<br/>
of the days of the Frankish kingdom, and beside it is said<br/>
to be the spot where the house of Zacchaeus stood. An<br/>
aged sycamore is shown as the tree from which the pious<br/>
man beheld the Redeemer. Miserable and decayed is this<br/>
place, where a flourishing city stood in ancient times and<br/>
even down to the days of the Crusaders.<br/>
<br/>
We rode past the outside huts, and came through fields<br/>
of wild oats and flowering shrubs and a vegetation resembling that of a garden, to the foot of the western hills.<br/>
Our immediate goal, the fine and famous Well of the Sultan<br/>
(Ain-es-Sultan), lay before us. At this point the expedition into the Valley of the Jordan proper was to commence<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
