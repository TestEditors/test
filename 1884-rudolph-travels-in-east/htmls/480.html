<span>322 TRAVELS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
during the last days of our journey. After breakfast we<br/>
agreed to pay a visit to the famous convent of Mar-Saba.<br/>
The road from the camp led through the narrow valley<br/>
mentioned above. The grass-covered sides fall steeply<br/>
on the right and left, but abruptly change their form and<br/>
terminate as vertical rocky cliffs in a deep stony ravine.<br/>
<br/>
The path wound above the rocks on the lowest edge<br/>
of the grass. The rocks below us in the whole of the dark<br/>
and gloomy ravine were undermined and full of caves<br/>
and nooks, in which quantities of rock pigeons and red<br/>
falcons breed peaceably side by side. At every step we<br/>
scared these feathered inhabitants, and they <span style="color: #0000FF;">Buttered </span>in<br/>
terror from one side of the ravine to the other In half an<br/>
hour we reached an old <span style="color: #0000FF;">watch-tower </span>which stands at the<br/>
edge of the rock; coming from above one sees no other<br/>
sign of the vast ecclesiastical establishment which is hidden<br/>
among the rocks of the ravine. At the tower the traveller<br/>
must knock with all his might at the securely bolted door<br/>
before they move below behind the thick walls and the<br/>
door slowly opens.<br/>
<br/>
The poor monks have to adopt many precautionary<br/>
measures for their own protection, for the Moslems have<br/>
played them many ugly tricks. In the year 614 the<br/>
convent was sacked for the first time by the Persian<br/>
hosts under <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chosroes</span>. In 796 and 842 other Asiatic<br/>
races followed their example, and after repeated minor<br/>
attacks came the great massacres of 1832 and 1834, in<br/>
which the wild tribes from the left bank of the Jordan<br/>
butchered all the monks. N ow every pilgrim who desires<br/>
admission must hand in a letter to the priest who <span style="color: #ff0000;">keeps<br/>
<br/>
