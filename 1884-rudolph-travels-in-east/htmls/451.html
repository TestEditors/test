appeared to the wise men. The saddle of the hill was<br/>
soon attained, and we found ourselves by the garden wall<br/>
of the great Greek convent, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mar-Elris</span>, standing amidst its<br/>
olives. The view from here is charming-a broad, stony,<br/>
grey-green valley, intersected by deep cuttings, rises to the<br/>
heights, on which Bethlehem lies in picturesque beauty.<br/>

to the beneficence of the old order of knights. We passed<br/>
through the garden to the second wall and into the paved<br/>
courtyard, in the middle of which a deep well stands.<br/>
Count Caboga founded this castle and the little hospice for<br/>
sick pilgrims and countrymen. He leads a pleasant life<br/>
here the whole year round, devoted to serious study and<br/>
works of charity. His servant, Ferdinand <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nicodemus</span>, a<br/>
