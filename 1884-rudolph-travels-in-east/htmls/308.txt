<br/>
also shot some carrion vultures between the houses; they<br/>
had assembled in great numbers in the vicinity of the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flayers</span>' yards. In the afternoon I returned through the<br/>
better quarters of the town, to dine on board the steamer.<br/>
<br/>
At sunset we all rode once more to the foot of the<br/>
mountains, and posted ourselves at different points. Some<br/>
of the gentlemen went to the graves in the rocks, while I<br/>
concealed myself in one of the buildings of the Mohammedan graveyard. It was a beautiful evening; perfect<br/>
stillness reigned around, and only a gentle breeze stirred<br/>
the leafy tops of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately no four-footed game came to my ambush; on the other hand, I watched more than twenty large<br/>
vultures in the distance, who came one after the other to<br/>
roost in a high cliff. It was amusing to see how the birds<br/>
quarrelled over their perches for the night. Naturally<br/>
enough, none of them desired to sit below the others, and<br/>
it was a long time before they all succeeded in squatting<br/>
one beside the other in a long fissure in the rock.<br/>
<br/>
I had to leave the graveyard at the end of an hour, as<br/>
the time for our journey drew on. At the Canal of Joseph<br/>
I joined my companions. They had seen jackals and a<br/>
large wolf, but all, unfortunately, in the rocks, and out of<br/>
fire<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>The Grand Duke had also seen a vampire (the bird<br/>
is as large as a raven) at the moment when the disgusting<br/>
creature was coming out of a tomb.<br/>
<br/>
We rode quickly back to the landing-place, bade a hearty<br/>
farewell to our worthy dark-hued admiral and the brave<br/>
ship which had been our abode during days of enjoyment<br/>
which can never be forgotten', and went to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">adjoining<br/>
