<br/>
<br/>
these <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppes </span>and deserts where only the true nomad<br/>
can exist. The territory ruled by the Turks reaches<br/>
to the Jordan, but the garrisons in Palestine are weak<br/>
and placed only in the larger towns; as already said,<br/>
many poor but <span style="color: #0000FF;">valorous </span>Bedouin tribes infest the frontier<br/>
hills, and they, too, are unfriendly to the government. The<br/>
territory of the Jordan is therefore perpetually exposed<br/>
to the attacks of the great tribes from the left bank, and<br/>
the history even of this century records many of their<br/>
predatory incursions.<br/>
<br/>
The squadron of cavalry which escorted our caravan<br/>
would have helped us as little as the commands or menaces<br/>
of the authorities, had those agile <span style="color: #ff0000;">spearsmen </span>swum the<br/>
river in hundreds some fine evening and surrounded us.<br/>
We might therefore well be grateful to the Pasha, who<br/>
had formally announced our journey and its course to the<br/>
aged sheik, and commended us to his protection.<br/>
<br/>
The nomad king, sensitive like all Orientals, felt<br/>
flattered by this courteous treatment, and came himself<br/>
from a great distance (for he spends most of his time<br/>
far away from the frontier), accompanied by a troop of<br/>
splendid horsemen, to the banks of the Jordan, crossed<br/>
the river by swimming, and awaited us beside our tents.<br/>
<br/>
Briefly, but in words of power and sincerity, he assured<br/>
us that we could pass safely along the whole course of<br/>
the Jordan, and that whatever we needed for the chase<br/>
was at our disposal; and, in fact, at every station we found<br/>
parties familiar with the locality, who procured us the<br/>
best sport and served us unweariedly. When Sheik<br/>
Ali promises safety one is more secure in those <span style="color: #ff0000;">regions<br/>
