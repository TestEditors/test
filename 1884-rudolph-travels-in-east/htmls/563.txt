<span style="color: #ff0000;">valescent</span>, moved slowly over the slabs of stone and rubble<br/>
and through the oak woods. The air was cool and pleasant,<br/>
and the high mountains around, touched by the morning sun,<br/>
shone with the most exquisite tints. After a toilsome<br/>
march we at length reached the valley and mounted our<br/>
horses.<br/>
<br/>
A second chain of hills, with slabs of rock, bushes, and<br/>
woods, could be crossed on horseback, and from the<br/>
opposite slope we had our first view of Nazareth lying<br/>
deep in a stony valley. We reached the further end of the<br/>
little town by some narrow streets. The doctor had forbidden me, on account of the fever, to enter any of the cold<br/>
cellar-like vaults. I was therefore unable to visit the<br/>
church, the famous Chapel of the Annunciation, and all the<br/>
other holy places.<br/>
<br/>
The architecture of the place recalled that of Bethlehem.<br/>
The population, composed of the members of many different<br/>
religious sects, has a different type of countenance from that.<br/>
of the people in Southern Palestine. The complexion is<br/>
lighter, and the costumes both of men and women are very<br/>
bright and picturesque. Our dining tent had been pitched<br/>
on an open space, and a part of the caravan rested on the<br/>
grass around. The greater number of the mules had gone<br/>
on with <span style="color: #ff0000;">ourluggage </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>Haifa. We breakfasted quickly, and<br/>
entered some low carriages drawn by small horses which<br/>
were waiting for us. A Swiss <span style="color: #ff0000;">eaztngbrmmr </span>established<br/>
many years ago this carriage communication between Haifa<br/>
and Nazareth. The road, if it can be called a road, which<br/>
we had to travel baffles all description, and we were <span style="color: #0000FF;">almost<br/>
</span>shaken to pieces up and down mountain sides and over<br/>
<br/>
