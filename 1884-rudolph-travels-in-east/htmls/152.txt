to take to the water, as the distance was, in fact, a considerable one. I hastened back to the camp to summon<br/>
more assistance. When I returned I saw, to my great joy,<br/>
a brown fellow already near the pelican in the foaming<br/>
waves. The Grand Duke was in ambush not far off, and<br/>
when he saw the dead bird, had <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>his companion,<br/>
a bold swimmer, into the flood.<br/>
<br/>
After a few minutes the brave Arab returned, drawing<br/>
the heavy bird after him by the beak as he swam. I was<br/>
glad of my first pelican. It was an exceptionally large<br/>
specimen. In the evening hours I went up and down on<br/>
the shore, on the look-out for the small strand birds.<br/>
<br/>
When it was too dark to shoot, the gentlemen all<br/>
came in to dinner. Again there was a fair show of game.<br/>
After our interesting day, slumber soon settled over<br/>
the camp.<br/>
<br/>
We were to have rowed early the next morning to the<br/>
opposite side of the island, to await on a tongue of land<br/>
the passage of the birds. During the night, alas! the<br/>
weather grew still worse, and before sunrise the storm<br/>
had increased so much that the boatmen refused to put out.<br/>
There was nothing to be done but to pass one more day on<br/>
the island. We all slept late, and went in the forenoon<br/>
with the dogs to the rocks, where we searched in vain; no<br/>
lynx was to be found. The rest of the day was therefore<br/>
devoted to the strand.<br/>
<br/>

</span>ing the island. Towards evening I made the circuit of the<br/>
whole island, and shot a fine Berber falcon and some <span style="color: #0000FF;">strand<br/>
</span>birds, and also a raven<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
