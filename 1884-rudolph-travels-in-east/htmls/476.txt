<span>320 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

<br/>
and the footpath led along the ridge of a high mountain<br/>
top, from which a splendid view opened. Immediately<br/>
below us was a steep <span style="color: #0000FF;">declivity-at </span>its base a circular valley<br/>
surrounded by high hills; right and left rose countless<br/>
summits, ridges, and far-stretching hills, all alike grey-green<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-a </span>true landscape of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppes</span>. A narrow ravine-like<br/>
gorge leads out from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bottom </span>in a south-easterly direction, and through it one catches a closely bounded view<br/>
of the deep-blue waters of the Dead Sea and the bare white<br/>
cliffs of the fine range of mountains on the opposite coast.<br/>
<br/>
The path descended in zigzags along the steep slope<br/>
below where we stood. The greater part of the packhorses of our caravan were still engaged in this difficult<br/>
descent, to the ceaseless tinkle of their bells, while the<br/>
quickest had already arrived in the valley, and our unwearied servants were putting up the first tents in a<br/>
stony field.<br/>
<br/>
The gentlemen went straight on, but the Grand Duke<br/>
and I preferred to wait on the ridge until the entire camp<br/>
was pitched, and meanwhile we had a kid slaughtered and<br/>
placed behind one of the summits which admitted of a<br/>
covered approach. Hundreds of vultures and eagles came<br/>
from the mountains of the Dead Sea and passed one after<br/>
another all in the same direction. They were taking their<br/>
daily promenade towards Jerusalem with punctual precision.<br/>
They did not condescend to bestow a single glance at our<br/>
kid. Only two ravens and one carrion vulture hovered<br/>
over the place, but without settling.<br/>
<br/>
The sun was burning intensely, no air was stirring,<br/>
and not the smallest cloud dimmed the dark-blue sky.<br/>
