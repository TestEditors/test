<span>A RACE ON THE PYRAMIDS. 207<br/>

desert; dark shadows lay on the eastern mountains, and<br/>
the old citadel, as well as the Mokattam mountains, shone<br/>
in rosy tints like our Alpine glow.<br/>
<br/>
Some of the Pyramid guides especially expert in<br/>
running, went, in virtue of a handsome backsheesh, in<br/>
eight minutes down from the top of the Cheops Pyramid<br/>
and up to the summit of that of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chefr√©n</span>, the upper part<br/>
of which, having no steps, is very dangerous to climb.<br/>
<br/>
After this display of activity we too climbed down<br/>
from our lofty station. On the way a young guide, with<br/>
a fine and genuinely Arab countenance, told me that he<br/>
was no Egyptian-not one of the miserable <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellaheen-but<br/>
</span>had the honour to spring from a noble stock in Algiers,<br/>
and as a man who had seen the world, knew not only<br/>
Tunis but also Morocco, where the true Arabs live, and<br/>
not the wretched mixed races of the Valley of the Nile.<br/>
The good man seemed to feel much irritation with his<br/>
present compatriots, and gave his feelings full vent as he<br/>
saw that the conversation interested me.<br/>
<br/>
At the foot of the Pyramids we had to look on at<br/>
a performance by some Bedouins. They rode past<br/>
each other at full speed, discharging their guns. Neither<br/>
the men, their horses, their clothes, nor their arms were<br/>
handsome or genuine. Wheresoever the great army of<br/>
Baedecker-reading tourists turns, there one finds trickery,<br/>
exaction, and these so-called national displays. The<br/>
Pyramids are as much a station for tourists as the Rigi;<br/>
and the hired Bedouins, with their foolish tricks, belong<br/>
to the same category as the wooden Chamois which you<br/>
find stuck up in Switzerland.<br/>
