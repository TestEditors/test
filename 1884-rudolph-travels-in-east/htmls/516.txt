<br/>
</span>dogs panted for water with drooping tongues. There was<br/>
but little water in the brook, and none that was very clear,<br/>
but the <span style="color: #ff0000;">extellent </span>Achmed had, as usual, some bottles of<br/>
lemonade ready, which he carried in a knapsack on his<br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
After half an hour's rest Salim summoned us to further<br/>
sport. The Grand Duke, Hoyos, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eschenbacher</span>, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rath<br/>
</span>resolved to return towards the camp, looking out for game<br/>
as they went. Chorinsky and I were still athirst for<br/>
action, and followed the Bedouins to the steppe. After a<br/>
long march we came to some low bush, followed by marshy<br/>
ground and a circular mass of reeds some hundred paces<br/>
in extent. Salim placed us on one side, while he posted<br/>
the heaters on the other. Whatever game might quit this<br/>
thicket was to be fired at as soon as it appeared. Achmed<br/>
is a worthy fellow, but free fights with wild beasts were not<br/>
to his taste, and as soon as he understood the situation he<br/>
begged me to allow him to rest behind some shrubs at a<br/>
certain distance, and disappeared without waiting for an<br/>
answer.<br/>
<br/>
Prepared for a vigorous wild boar hunt, I placed myself<br/>
by a well-marked rising. The dogs had hardly got among<br/>
the reeds when a wild baiting began. The sound of the<br/>
chase and bay came in quick succession, and the bark of the<br/>
dogs mingled with the demoniac cries of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters</span>. At<br/>
length, after a tedious though exciting quarter of an hour, a<br/>
large wild boar rushed from the thicket, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">betook </span>itself<br/>
in full flight towards the point at which I stood. Deeply<br/>
wounded by a shot under the shoulder, it fell as I fired, but<br/>
recovering itself and foaming with rage, at once pursued its<br/>
<br/>
