Some carrion vultures soon appeared, three hooded<br/>
vultures followed them-the middle-sized black African<br/>
vulture, with dark, bald head. I had never seen this very<br/>
loathsome-looking bird before, and hastened, therefore,<br/>
to shoot a specimen. At the shot the fellaheen hurried<br/>
up from all sides, looking at my spoil with curiosity, and<br/>
