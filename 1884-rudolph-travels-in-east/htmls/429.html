<span>OUR CAMP OUTSIDE THE WALLS. 283<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
quitted the hospice by a street leading to the old Gate of<br/>
Damascus. Our handsome camp had been pitched just<br/>
without the gate, beside some stony places and heaps of<br/>
ruin, and amongst stunted olive gardens. The horses and<br/>
beasts of burden lay close by. Our people slept on the<br/>
ground. The Turkish squadron which had escorted us<br/>
from Jaffa <span style="color: #ff0000;">bivouacked </span>near us, and the infantry from<br/>
Jerusalem made a cordon round the whole camp, as the<br/>
public, especially the Jews and Christians, sought to <span style="color: #0000FF;">importune </span>us with heaps of petitions.<br/>
<br/>
After the heat and fatigue of the day rest was welcome.<br/>
A cool evening and fine sunset were restorative, and when<br/>
dinner was over stillness soon reigned in the camp. The<br/>
incessant howling of the half-savage dogs within the walls<br/>
still resounded in our ears, as well as the cries of the<br/>
multitudes of <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackals </span>who hung about the slaughter-yards,<br/>
which were only separated from the camp by a small<br/>
valley.<br/>
<br/>
Early on the morning of the 30th we all went, masters<br/>
and servants, to the hospice, where the chaplain, the clergy<br/>
of the house, and some German-speaking Franciscans<br/>
confessed the whole travelling party. From thence we<br/>
made a pilgrimage to the Church of the Sepulchre, where,<br/>
in the chapel on the stone of the sepulchre itself, the chaplain<br/>
said Mass <span style="color: #ff0000;">andgave </span>the Holy Communion to us all. After<br/>
Mass the prelate proceeded to bless the numerous articles<br/>
which we had brought as memorials, and which had Iain<br/>
on the stone of the sepulchre during the service.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the chapel, we went over the great church and<br/>
through another little chapel, belonging to the Franciscans,<br/>
<br/>
