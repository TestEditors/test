<span>34o TRAVELS IN THE EAST<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
</span>Salim, the leader of a body of hunting Bedouins, was<br/>
to direct us to a spot rich in game. He was a capable,<br/>
excellent fellow, to whom I soon grew attached, and whom<br/>
I valued as a sportsman. Bred up on horseback, hunting<br/>
or in battle, he might be taken as the model of a typical<br/>
and absolutely free Arab. His frame was small but<br/>
sinewy, his countenance marked by its energetic features,<br/>
its short beard, and a pair of falcon eyes. His complexion<br/>
was singularly dark for this district, and had more the<br/>
hue of the African Arab. His apparel consisted of a<br/>
small turban, a white tightly girt burnous, and yellow<br/>
shoes, above which his skinny legs showed. He bore<br/>
by way of arms a short knife.in his girdle and a whip<br/>
in his hand. His comrades were about fifteen in number,<br/>
tall lanky fellows, mostly bearded and of a dark <span style="color: #ff0000;">yellowbrown </span>complexion, with tattered garments and turbaned<br/>
heads, their clothes made partly of white and partly of<br/>
brown and white striped stuff, armed with long muskets,<br/>
old pistols, and short knives, and brandishing sticks or<br/>
lashes. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>hearty, kindly fellows, devoted to<br/>
the chase. The dogs followed, wolf-like beasts of no<br/>
breed or race, but whose gifts we learned to appreciate.<br/>
Some of the Bedouins had curly hair and exceptionally<br/>
dark skin-indicating plainly the trace of negro blood.<br/>
<br/>
We left the camp with this company; a longish march<br/>
was before us. Riding was impossible, for the horses had<br/>
been out at work since sunrise, and we required them<br/>
in full health and strength for the coming days. Salim<br/>
guided us at first through so-called <span style="color: #0000FF;">formic</span>. These are<br/>
more truly luxuriant green meadows, and fields of wild<br/>
