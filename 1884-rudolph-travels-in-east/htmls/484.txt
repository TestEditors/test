<span>324 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
in which the skulls of the martyrs slain by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chosroiis </span>are<br/>
preserved. The principal church of the convent is a pure<br/>
Greek basilica, and contains many black pictures of saints<br/>
on gold ground, and all the rich silver-gilt <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>silver articles<br/>
which one finds in the orthodox Greek place of worship.<br/>
The bishop recited a Greek prayer of thanksgiving in our<br/>
presence at the altar, and choral songs by the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monks<br/>
</span>followed; the effect within these old walls was very fine<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The'tomb </span>of St. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chryssorrhoas </span>of Damascus, one of<br/>
the foremost of the F athers of the Greek Church, was also<br/>
shown us. We had, of course, to kiss many sacred spots<br/>
and stones, and to inhale much incense and attar of roses.<br/>
We next proceeded to a regular inspection of the convent.<br/>
The sixty-five monks live in the cells of the main <span style="color: #0000FF;">building-more </span>or less habitable hollows in the rock, and in wooden<br/>
sheds built on the rock. On the platforms and terraces,<br/>
wherever a spot could be found, the pious brothers have<br/>
made small gardens with soil laboriously carried thither;<br/>
in one of these is an ancient palm which St. Saba himself<br/>
planted, and which bears stoneless dates to the present day<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Visiting all the chambers is a fatiguing <span style="color: #0000FF;">process-upstairs<br/>
</span>and downstairs, and often through such <span style="color: #0000FF;">low </span>passages that<br/>
one has to walk bent double; in addition to this a dreadful<br/>
smell pervades the whole place. In a separate small<br/>
building there is a poorly fitted stranger's room, and here<br/>
the kindly monks treated us to their dreadful rose-coloured,<br/>
insipid drinks<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">_<br/>
</span>From this room we went by an outdoor staircase to<br/>
the entrance of the cave of St. Saba. We had to pass<br/>
through several damp chambers in the rock. According <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
