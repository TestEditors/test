<span>104 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
two head of small game, among them many interesting<br/>
specimens, made the sum of our gains.<br/>
<br/>
In the so-called waiting-room we dined. Evening had<br/>
already fallen, and our train stood ready. Our chattels<br/>
were put into the carriages, and we soon left <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abuskar </span>to<br/>
proceed on a further expedition. For two hours the two<br/>
brothers Saurma and Prince Taxis kept us company.<br/>
When we reached the Valley of the Nile and its station,<br/>
these three gentlemen left us.<br/>
<br/>
After very hearty <span style="color: #0000FF;">leave-takings</span>, we steamed southwards<br/>
towards Siut<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>the next point in our pleasant Nile journey.<br/>
We settled ourselves as comfortably as we could in the<br/>
carriages, and soon found the sleep our hard work had <span style="color: #0000FF;">so<br/>
</span>well earned<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
