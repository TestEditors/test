guard at a window of the tower, and who, by means of<br/>
special apparatus, lowers the same to the main building<br/>
of the convent. Permission to enter is returned in the<br/>
same way, and the door is then opened. After sunset no<br/>
one is admitted even with a letter, nor may any woman,<br/>
according to the strict rule of Greek monasteries, tread the<br/>
domain of this pious colony.<br/>
<br/>
We passed through the gate below the tower by a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Right </span>of steps to a second door, and from thence by a yet<br/>
longer flight of steps to a small flagged terrace. The<br/>
roads divide here, and one gets the first sight into the<br/>
interior of this remarkable building. It is a conglomerate<br/>
of stairs, platforms, terraces, and living rooms built on to<br/>
the rock<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Old wooden sheds and galleries carried on<br/>
beams, chapels, caves and grottoes stretch along the cliff<br/>
from the tower at the top nearly to the bottom of the<br/>
ravine. The lowest part is only connected with the<br/>
convent by a staircase leading down to it. The entrance<br/>
below is, of course, defended from intruders from the valley<br/>
by strong doors and a labyrinth of galleries. To describe<br/>
all the chambers of this remarkable building would be a<br/>
tedious task. A jumble of staircases, much dirt, little light,<br/>
and bare rock showing through everywhere, are the distinctive peculiarities of this convent.<br/>
<br/>
The Greek Bishop of Bethlehem received us on the<br/>
first platform, surrounded by a large number of very poor<br/>
looking monks. In the centre of the platform there is a<br/>
small building with a cupola in which stands the richly<br/>
ornamented tomb of St. Saba; hard by is the small church<br/>
of St. Nicholas (more or less a simple hollow in the rock),<br/>
