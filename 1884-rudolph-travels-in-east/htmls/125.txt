cupola. In the sanctuary are two cubes of stone with the<br/>
print of the Prophet's feet, which the founder, Kait-Bey, is<br/>
said to have brought from Mecca.<br/>
<br/>
A ride.through this city of tombs offers many very<br/>
interesting points of view. Before us were the solemn<br/>
cliffs; to the right the citadel, built on the rocks, crowned<br/>
by its slender, lofty minaret; around us lay a medley of<br/>
tombs, grave-stones, mosques, all falling to pieces and <span style="color: #0000FF;">battered </span>by the sand of the desert; between rose bare hillocks<br/>
with stone-built Arab windmills like towers on their tops.<br/>
A <span style="color: #ff0000;">gloomier </span>aspect is given to this picture by the many<br/>
signs which indicate that <span style="color: #ff0000;">hyanas</span>, jackals, wolves, and dogs<br/>
howl funeral dirges here by night over the dead Moslems.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>had soon reached the stone quarries with their<br/>
steep sides and great blocks of stone lying in confusion<br/>
around. We left our asses here and clambered by <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br/>
</span>narrow path between stones and precipices half-way up<br/>
the mountain side. At some points the sportsman has<br/>
need of a good head, and the smooth yellow-grey and<br/>
dark-brown slabs of this desert mountain demand a certain<br/>
dexterity to escape mishap.<br/>
<br/>
In a narrow ravine, hemmed in by cliffs, and not far<br/>
from the highest fortress-like ridge of the mountain, we<br/>
found an Arab beside a dead ass.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Here </span>Baron Saurma had caused a wall to be built<br/>
across the mouth of a hole in one of the cliffs, so as to<br/>
make a hidden battery in the mountain side<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>My uncle,<br/>
with Saurma's servant, the clever Nubian Osman<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">me<br/>
</span>huntsman, and I, climbed hand and foot over a <span style="color: #0000FF;">narrow<br/>
</span>ledge into the small and uncommonly uncomfortable<br/>
<br/>
