<span>272 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
first the road penetrated a narrow valley, its steep slopes<br/>
to right and left being covered with rocks and thick<br/>
evergreens. The character of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flora </span>in these regions<br/>
is distinctly Mediterranean, such as one finds it on the<br/>
coasts of Spain, Greece, Italy, and the western parts<br/>
of North Africa, especially Morocco. In Palestine this<br/>
zone is a narrow one, and, disappearing gradually at<br/>
Jerusalem, gives place eastward of Bethlehem to the<br/>
vegetation of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppes </span>and of the interior of Asia.<br/>
<br/>
Passing the old well <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bir-Egyub </span>(Well of Job), we<br/>
came through the ravine of Wadi Ali and by the ruins<br/>
of an old mosque to the ridge of the hills. Their<br/>
appearance is uniform-nothing but dazzling white rocks<br/>
separated from each other by thorny bushes. Here and<br/>
there tumbling houses or ruins appear among the rocks.<br/>
There are few cliffs, but, on the other hand, there are<br/>
numerous long and quite smooth slabs on the declivities<br/>
of the hills.<br/>
<br/>
Innumerable eagles and vultures soared in the air,<br/>
but among the shrubs we saw very few birds; occasional<br/>
partridges ran swiftly up the slopes. After two hours of<br/>
travel we attempted deer-stalking along the top of the<br/>
hills with our Arab <span style="color: #ff0000;">huntsmen..<br/>
<br/>
</span>A fine view opened before us into a stretch of vales<br/>
and ravines-always the same in character, with a<br/>
Mediterranean <span style="color: #0000FF;">flora </span>like that of the mountains of Zante.<br/>
In the far east we saw the yellow-grey ridges and tops of<br/>
the plateau on which Jerusalem lies, and the commencement of the chain of hills in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">interior'of </span>the country,<br/>
which have a totally different aspect<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
