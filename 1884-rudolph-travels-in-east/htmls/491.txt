<br/>
Count for this attention, for the beautiful animal was <span style="color: #ff0000;">surefooted </span>on the mountain and fleet in the plains; it could<br/>
also stand the heavy work of the day and the open air at<br/>
night. As soon as every one was on horseback we set<br/>
forward, the Bedouins in front.<br/>
<br/>
The country at first was of the same character as that<br/>
round our camp, but the valleys soon grew narrower and<br/>
the hills <span style="color: #0000FF;">higher</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>and in place of grass bare yellow earth<br/>
and smooth large slabs of stone had to be ridden over.<br/>
On a small field surrounded with rocks in the middle of<br/>
this wilderness stood two storks. They were probably<br/>
migrating. I shot one of them as it rose.<br/>
<br/>
The path was exceedingly difficult for the horses, and<br/>
they had to step with the greatest care, for the ground was<br/>
such that a fall into the abyss might easily have occurred.<br/>
We came by countless points and tops, over ridges, through<br/>
valleys and ravines, riding perpetually up and down hill.<br/>
The ground was much broken, and was also quite without<br/>
a trace of human activity. After a long ride, the character<br/>
of the ground changed. The slopes were more gentle, the<br/>
stones disappeared; tall thin grass and blossoming flowers<br/>
bespoke the true steppe in spring array.<br/>
<br/>
The tawny mountains which we had climbed before held<br/>
on their course from south to north, barring all view to<br/>
westward. We came upon a plateau perfumed with<br/>
flowers and crossed it at a gallop. The ground was good<br/>
and the horses pranced about, glad to have escaped from<br/>
the smooth rocks and steep paths.<br/>
<br/>
A steppe is majestic, and though monotonous is not sad,<br/>
like the far more impressive desert. The wealth of<br/>
