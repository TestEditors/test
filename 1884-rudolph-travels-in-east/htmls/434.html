<span>288 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and noise, of which one can hardly form an idea, prevail in<br/>
those streets. Half-naked children tumbled about on the<br/>
pavement, and Jewish women with ill-arranged kerchiefs<br/>
twisted round shorn heads, leaned from the windows. The<br/>
men bought and sold, bargained and cheated. There were<br/>
Jews from all countries, but few of them in ordinary dress.<br/>
Many Polish Jews wore the talar, with high boots and<br/>
velvet caps; but most were in Eastern costume, resembling<br/>
that of the old Hebrews. All languages might be heard,<br/>
German and Hebrew preponderating.<br/>
<br/>
With difficulty we passed through this crowd to reach<br/>
the synagogue. The rabbi and elders of the congregation<br/>
received us with a German address, and offered us a seat<br/>
to rest within the temple. The synagogue is a new building, and looks just like those at home. Very few of the<br/>
Jews present were in fine robes. Most of them wore<br/>
the caftan and seemed to be Poles. While we remained<br/>
they sang a hymn on their circular estrade and recited a<br/>
prayer in their quaint fashion, with nervous movements<br/>
and turnings of the eyes. We soon left, followed by the<br/>
superabounding <span style="color: #0000FF;">benedictions </span>of the synagogue.<br/>
<br/>
As the Holy Sepulchre was open, unusual crowds were<br/>
passing up and down the streets. Russians, Bulgarians,<br/>
Wallachians, Armenians, denizens of Asia Minor, Greeks,<br/>
Copts, and pilgrims of the Latin faith, made an interesting<br/>
medley of races.<br/>
<br/>
After breakfasting in our camp, we rode on horseback<br/>
along the ancient grey walls of sacred Zion to the famous<br/>
and wonderful Mosque of Omar. The Haram-esh-Sherif<br/>
is a large space enclosed by walls. The principal mosque<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
