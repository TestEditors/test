</span>and tow us, which would be a very tedious and laborious<br/>
proceeding..<br/>
<br/>
We had also already reached the centre of the lake.<br/>
From our present southern outlook we could see with the<br/>
naked eye, in the far distance, a minaret and the palm trees<br/>
of the little town of Menzaleh.<br/>
<br/>
The sailors advised us to give up the old programme,<br/>
and to make for Port Said. This was a very serious<br/>
alteration of the plan of our journey, but it appeared to be<br/>
the only rational course, especially as the chief steersman<br/>
promised, with the then favourable west wind, to reach Port<br/>
Said at full sail the same evening.<br/>
<br/>
Said and done; we got on board our vessels, and the<br/>
light <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiy√© </span>sped swiftly between the islands without<br/>
stop or stay. The eastern parts of the lake are even<br/>
richer in wild birds than the western. We saw quantities<br/>
of shovel-birds; also many species of ducks, and flocks of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">sea-mews</span>; herons likewise, and cormorants. A group of<br/>
pelicans were <span style="color: #0000FF;">fired </span>at successfully, and a splendid specimen'<br/>
found its way to the deck of our dahabiya.<br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon the dazzling white lighthouse of Port<br/>
Said appeared on the horizon. We saw some flocks of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flamingoes </span>standing in the distance, and others sailing<br/>
slowly away. The sky cleared, and we enjoyed the warm<br/>
sunbeams, and again had a fine and striking sunset.<br/>
<br/>
Our crew handled their sails very <span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully</span>. They were<br/>
excellent and extraordinarily laborious fellows, to whom we<br/>
grew quite attached in the two days.<br/>
<br/>
By the time twilight came we could distinguish the<br/>
houses of the town and the dyke of the Suez Canal, and by<br/>
