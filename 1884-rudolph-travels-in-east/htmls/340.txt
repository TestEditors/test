<br/>
world, a colossal lagoon, separated by a narrow line of<br/>
dunes from the sea. Its western and southern boundaries<br/>
are long reaches of marsh, and to the east it finds its<br/>
outlet at the inner dyke of the Canal of Suez.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving Damietta you have to the north the yellow<br/>
line of dunes; to the south, in the far distance, the green<br/>
margin of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">term </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">yirmas </span>to the east the prospect is<br/>
extensive, and land and water melt into each other as at<br/>
sea. At first we saw but few islands, and those at a great<br/>
distance.<br/>
<br/>
The depth of the lake throughout its forty-five square<br/>
miles is nowhere greater than would reach the hips. The<br/>
bottom is stiff clay. In storms, which are sometimes very<br/>
violent, drowning is precluded by the fact that one can<br/>
stand and walk in all parts of it, so one gets at worst a<br/>
copious bath.<br/>
<br/>
In the winter months this lagoon is literally covered<br/>
by migratory birds of all kinds, and especially ducks and<br/>
geese. In the second half of March one could only<br/>
reckon on the home birds and some late-travelling northern<br/>
species. The sea and imperial eagles, which frequent<br/>
the lake in great numbers in winter, were also absent,<br/>
and only some spotted eagles <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lere </span>seen among the<br/>
islands.<br/>
<br/>
We agreed to separate at first and take different lines,<br/>
but all to keep within sight, and to meet at noon at a given<br/>
signal for luncheon. We soon saw some pelicans swimming, but an attempt to get near them in a small boat<br/>
failed as usual, and we pursued our way in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiy√©</span>.<br/>
<br/>
After a short sail we got into the region of the islands.<br/>
