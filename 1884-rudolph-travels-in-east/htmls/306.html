stretch. We arrived there at noon. An avenue leads<br/>
from the landing-place into Siut; it is the most important<br/>
and considerable town above Cairo, is the seat of a Mudir,<br/>
and has a considerable trade and superior <span style="color: #ff0000;">buildiiigs</span>. It<br/>
is true the houses are even here built of clay, but they<br/>
are higher, and decorated with better Arabian ornaments,<br/>
than the other more southerly towns of the Nile. The<br/>
minarets and the handsome gates of the town at once<br/>
strike the traveller; shady sycamore avenues and fruitful<br/>
gardens surround the town in the direction of the river.<br/>
<br/>
We rode through some narrow streets, and between the<br/>
stalls along the whole length of the very noticeable bazaar,<br/>
which the caravan route from Darfur, which terminates<br/>
here, keeps richly supplied with ostrich feathers and ivory.<br/>
The red and black pottery of Siut are also a specialty.<br/>
The stir and activity which prevailed in this bazaar<br/>
interested me much. The inhabitants of the Valley of the<br/>
Nile, from all the provinces of Egypt, in their gay and<br/>
varied costumes, were side by side with the genuine<br/>
commercial fellaheen.<br/>
<br/>
We crossed the town, and from the opposite side, passing<br/>
along a dyke and over the well-known Canal of Joseph,<br/>
reached the foot of the steep mountains. At Siut the<br/>
mountains come nearer to the river, and the broad plain of<br/>
cultivated land above and below is narrowed for a short<br/>
space. We climbed straight up a steep and narrow path<br/>
to look at the caves and sepulchral chapels which stand<br/>
half-way up the mountain among the rocks and rubble.<br/>
<br/>
This place had a certain importance in ancient times.<br/>
