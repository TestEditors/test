<span>HILLS AROUND <span style="color: #0000FF;">BETHLEHEM</span>. 311<br/>

he took part in the campaign of 1870, and returned, soon<br/>
after the conclusion of peace, to his own home to shoot<br/>
partridges as before.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hoyos </span>and I now set forth with this pair to search<br/>
the country for game for the afternoon. Advancing into<br/>
a valley eastward, we passed some flocks. The picturesquely clad shepherds pleased me much. Those who<br/>
first worshipped by the cradle of the Son of God were<br/>
surely such as those who now roamed the hills with their<br/>
goats, singing monotonous songs.<br/>
<br/>
The hills rose higher and steeper, and were covered<br/>
with yellow grass. I noticed that there was already a<br/>
change in the character of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flora</span>. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Betsahur </span>is the<br/>
last village in this direction, and at the beginning of the<br/>
grey-green mountains and of the flora of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Jordan</span>,<br/>
the territory of the Bedouin tribes is entered, where a<br/>
certain amount of caution must be exercised.<br/>
<br/>
We clambered eagerly about on the hills. We saw and<br/>
heard some partridges, but the few that are to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">met </span>with<br/>
in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem are so wild there is<br/>
little chance of getting up to them. We roamed with our<br/>
experienced huntsmen over some hills back towards the<br/>
village, entering the region of olive trees and neglected<br/>
gardens.<br/>
<br/>
Southward from the ridge on which Bethlehem and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Betsahur </span>stand is a deeply indented valley whose sides<br/>
have terraces of olives and vines; between these rise rocky<br/>
cliffs with piled-up stones, forming niches and <span style="color: #ff0000;">hollows<br/>
<br/>
</span>covered with evergreens, giving a most picturesque aspect<br/>
to the whole.<br/>
