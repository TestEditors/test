the legend, the saint and his lion (whom he had tamed by<br/>
prayer) lived happily together in two grottoes. Fresh<br/>
straw laid down showed that specially enthusiastic monks<br/>
inhabit this gloomy spot from time to time in order to<br/>
imitate the saint. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ear </span>this spot we saw another cave in<br/>
the rock. An aged monk clad in miserable rags, his pale<br/>
face furrowed by religious excitement, had chosen this<br/>
abode for himself. He reached his dwelling by vertical<br/>
steps and a narrow plank fixed to the rock. He had to<br/>
cross this perilous road daily. We saw him returning<br/>
to his home from the church by this dangerous footway.<br/>
<br/>
From one of the large platforms we had a good view<br/>
into the ravine. The opposite cliffs are at most one<br/>
hundred and fifty paces off. There are caves and grottoes<br/>
in them too, now tenanted only by jackals, falcons, and<br/>
pigeons; formerly they were occupied by hermits.<br/>
<br/>
A bird which I saw nowhere else in Palestine lives in<br/>
great numbers on the rocks near the convent. This was<br/>
the mountain <span style="color: #0000FF;">starling</span>. All the pinnacles, platforms, roofs<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>and rocks are literally covered with these brilliant blueblack birds with reddish-brown pinions, and their song<br/>
resounds on all sides. A monk has tamed them so that<br/>
when he whistles and calls at an appointed hour each day<br/>
they come <span style="color: #0000FF;">fluttering </span>down and settle at his feet, or even on<br/>
his head and shoulders, and take crumbs of bread from his<br/>
hand. Even the wild beasts are lured hither; every<br/>
evening at the hour of prayer jackals appear in the ravine<br/>
and wait till pieces of bread are thrown down to them.<br/>
<br/>
From all this it may be assumed that Eastern Christianity has here remained stationary on the level of the<br/>
