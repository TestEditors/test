<br/>
shall never forget the night in this narrow cell. We had<br/>
fallen on a perfect menagerie of vermin, and gigantic fleas<br/>
devoured our poor bodies.<br/>
<br/>
On the 18th we left our dahabiya, while it was still quite<br/>
dark, resolved to scatter ourselves once more among the<br/>
islands, and to await the morning passage of the birds. I<br/>
had myself rowed to a narrow island, crept up in the grey<br/>
dawn to a small group of flamingoes-failed with a shot<br/>
from a huge distance, and thereupon hid myself in the<br/>
thick shrubs. A variety of birds passed, and I bagged<br/>
several, among them a glossy heron. Clusters of <span style="color: #ff0000;">fiamirr</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>goes, forming positive clouds of thousands of these rosy<br/>
creatures, went by in the most various directions up and<br/>
down, but all out of range.<br/>
<br/>
When the time was over we gathered again at the<br/>
sailing boats. It was a most unpleasant day; the sky was<br/>
thickly covered with clouds, a keen strong wind blew<br/>
across the water, and scuds of rain drenched us periodically.<br/>
<br/>
As a side wind carried us towards the southern part of<br/>
the lake, we saw from time to time gigantic troops of<br/>
pelicans and flamingoes standing on the sand-banks, We<br/>
made for one of these companies in the boat, and in so<br/>
doing passed an island entirely covered with sea-mews and<br/>
spoonbills. A salvo was again given to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flamingoes<br/>
</span>without result. Colossal clouds of birds rose, to settle<br/>
together in the far distance.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped at one of the small islands to breakfast on<br/>
the shore. As the storm was still increasing a council was<br/>
held. Our first plan was to go back to Damietta, but the<br/>
Arabs declared that with the wind as it was, they must <span style="color: #0000FF;">row<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
