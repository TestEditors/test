<br/>
A little further, and we reach the famous old town of<br/>
Tanta. Seen from a distance, the town might be taken for<br/>
a heap of rubbish, surrounded by flowering gardens, palms,<br/>
and dusky <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores</span>. A nearer view shows the bustle of<br/>
ever-moving Eastern life, and the masses of houses built<br/>
of grey clay and tumbled, so to speak, on the top of one<br/>
another in wild confusion, but all decorated picturesquely in<br/>
Arab style.<br/>
<br/>
Tanta is known for the fair held there thrice a year.<br/>
Even in the days of Herodotus, these fairs were held in<br/>
Lower Egypt, and mostly in the eastern Delta. They put<br/>
the whole country in commotion, and often degenerated<br/>
into most dreadful orgies. In ancient days these festivals<br/>
were in honour of the goddess Bubastis; now they are held<br/>
in that of Said of Tanta (Seyd-Achmed el-Bedawi), who died<br/>
here as a saint, A.D. 1200, but they maintain their character<br/>
for riotous dissipation.<br/>
<br/>
The train stopped but for a few moments at Tanta.<br/>
The remainder of the journey brought similar scenes to<br/>
view. At Benha-el-Asl we crossed the Damietta branch<br/>
of the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
A great castle, standing amongst gardens, is known for<br/>
the dreadful deed done there. In <span style="color: #ff0000;">18 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">54</span>, Abbas Pasha, son<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tussum</span>, who was governor in the days of Mehmet Ali,<br/>
was murdered there by two Mamelukes. It is said that<br/>
his fate was not altogether undeserved.<br/>
<br/>
A delightful moment is at hand, when the monotony of<br/>
the landscape of Lower Egypt draws to an end.<br/>
<br/>
Here and there across the meadows we see, rising to the<br/>
south-west, the yellow horizon of the Libyan desert; right<br/>
