nature is traded upon, here his faith and devotion are<br/>

<br/>
We halted in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kul6niye</span>, as our arrival at Jerusalem<br/>
was fixed for the afternoon. The time which intervened<br/>
was spent in roving along the hillsides. We found nothing<br/>
there but grey-green, terraced olive woods, occasional<br/>
shrubs and rocks. The fierce midday heat scorched the<br/>
barren country, and we dragged ourselves painfully up<br/>
the steep slopes, an Asiatic nutcracker and the grey<br/>
Syrian hare being the only wild species which we saw.<br/>
The Grand Duke shot poor puss, but could not find her<br/>
among the stones. Hoyos had no better luck on the<br/>
other side of the valley with a jackal. I shot some of<br/>
the odious large black lizards which are found on every<br/>
rock in the stony parts of Palestine.<br/>
<br/>
The heat became intolerable, and we all of us soon<br/>
made our way back to the pilgrims' house. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">breakfasted </span>in the shade of an olive tree on the spot where the<br/>
Emmaus of the New Testament stood, and hard by where<br/>
David slew Goliath. Our Consul-general, Count Caboga,<br/>
had come out to meet us from Jerusalem, and we eagerly<br/>
discussed with him the plans for the next day. After<br/>
breakfast the whole company put on full uniform. The<br/>
clergy of the different rites and the dragomans from the<br/>
consulates met us here, and then preceded us to Jerusalem<br/>
to prepare for the grand reception. We then started,<br/>
as time was getting on and our entry had to be made to<br/>
the minute.<br/>
<br/>
The road winds in zigzags along the slope of the<br/>
hill up to the plateau. The shrubs and every trace <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
