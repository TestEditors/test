common wild duck, disported themselves on the water in<br/>
quantities. Spoonbills, divers, and smaller ducks which one<br/>
could not distinguish in the distance, swam around. Grey,<br/>
silver, and king herons stood on the islands, and flocks<br/>
of smaller indigenous birds of variou's kinds swarmed on<br/>
the sand-banks. No island offered sufficient attraction to<br/>

We resolved to stop here and shoot on foot. The<br/>
herons of various kinds disappeared in a moment at our<br/>

scooper, that very remarkable black-and-white coloured<br/>
bird with long spindle legs and upturned beak, ruffs also,<br/>

The shots soon cracked merrily, and in less than half an<br/>

<br/>
The islands themselves are so peculiar in their formation that they deserve a few words of description. They<br/>
are almost all very narrow but long, covered with<br/>
shells, one might almost say formed out of them. The<br/>
