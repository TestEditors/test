he soon saw in the distance a number of obelisks, which<br/>
mark the approach to the City of the Sun, far famed both<br/>
for its age and its history. Placed on the very edge of<br/>
the desert, whose orange sands mingle with the dark mould<br/>
of the fields, a sanctuary was reared to the god of Light,<br/>
Ra, whose existence the oldest inscriptions in the pyramid<br/>
tombs proclaim.<br/>
<br/>
"To him, as well as to the neighbouring town, the<br/>
records of all ages give the most ancient and popular<br/>
name of Annu. It is the On of the Bible, in which that<br/>
priest <span style="color: #ff0000;">Potiphera </span>dwelt, whose daughter Asnath was given<br/>
to his minister Joseph to wife by the Pharaoh of that day.<br/>
Besides the name we have mentioned, the temple and the<br/>
town belonging to it bear a second, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I </span>Pi-ra,' i.e. the' City of<br/>
the Sun-god, Ra,' from which has arisen the Greek name of<br/>
Heliopolis. The first laying out of the sanctuary and of<br/>
the place is attributed, with great probability, to Arabian<br/>
immigrants, who came from the East into the Delta, and<br/>
settled on the site of the later city of Heliopolis.<br/>

Egyptian mythology, and formed a distinct body of<br/>
doctrine, which, even in the later periods of Egyptian<br/>
history, when Greek philosophers, such as Plato and<br/>
Eudoxus, visited the town, was imparted in the priests'<br/>
schools as the principal secret of their teaching. The<br/>
above-named philosophers succeeded with difficulty in <span style="color: #0000FF;">inducing </span>the learned priests of Heliopolis to impart to them<br/>
some of the most important dogmas of astronomical import.<br/>
