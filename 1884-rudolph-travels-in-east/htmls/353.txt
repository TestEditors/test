<span>HELIOPOLIS ONCE MORE. 223<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Early on the 29th we resolved to make another shooting party to Heliopolis. The weather was perfect, the air<br/>
fresh and warm. After a long drive on the same bad<br/>
road by which we had travelled a month before, we reached<br/>
the "Tree of Mary." The dachshunds were set loose to<br/>
search for jackals and ichneumons in the small gardens and<br/>
thick cactus hedges near, but we soon perceived how fruitless the search would be, for the season of quails had<br/>
come, and we heard shots in all directions. Eastern<br/>
Sunday pleasure-seekers, Levantines of all degrees, with<br/>
not much of the sportsman about them, ransacked bush<br/>
and field, so that it appeared advisable to vacate the<br/>
ground.<br/>
<br/>
There is a small restaurateur near the "Tree of Mary,"<br/>
among gardens and shady trees--<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>favourite retreat of the<br/>
Cairenes. Here we breakfasted, and then went on between<br/>
fields and gardens to the ostrich farm. This establishment<br/>
lies on the verge of the desert, and belongs to a company<br/>
which seems to do a very good business. Everything,<br/>
at least, is-most comfortably arranged. The director, a<br/>
German Swiss, showed us the birds' quarters, the open<br/>
sandy spaces, the inner courts, the artificial hatching<br/>
apparatus, and all his ostriches, stately birds, both young<br/>
and old, of two different species, and in the full beauty of<br/>
their fine plumage.<br/>
<br/>
After we had seen all we took the shortest way' to the<br/>
well-known orange gardens at Heliopolis. We found some<br/>
wolf tracks, but the beasts were not at home on this<br/>
occasion, and so we vainly searched all the bushes <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
</span>grounds of this beautiful orange grove<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On our way<br/>
