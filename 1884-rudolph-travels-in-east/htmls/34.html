<span>8 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
closely ranged houses rising step above step, with their<br/>
dazzling white walls, green windows, and flat roofs, remind<br/>
one of Italy. Yet there is a specifically Greek character<br/>
attaching to the whole, intensified by the round cupolas<br/>
of the orthodox churches.<br/>
<br/>
Passing by the rocky wall of the citadel, which dips<br/>
vertically into the sea, we came along the southern side of<br/>
the promontory, covered with the luxuriant gardens and<br/>
handsome villas of the rich <span style="color: #ff0000;">Coriiotes</span>; we saw the beautifully<br/>
situated royal country-house, Pondikonisi, the suburb of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kastrades</span>, and below, on the shore, amid wild myrtles, the<br/>
ruins of the ancient temple of <span style="color: #0000FF;">AEsculapius</span>. We steamed<br/>
further to the bay of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Karddki6</span>, whose entrance is barred by<br/>
two islets. That in front, a great rock covered with orange<br/>
trees, quinces, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">cypresses</span>, with an ancient Greek shrine<br/>
and a house for two monks of the strict order of St. Basil, is<br/>
called Pondikonisi, and is the ship of Odysseus turned to<br/>
stone by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Poseidon</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>"But the earthshaker nigh to her drew,<br/>
And with flat hand striking, he smote her, and turned the ship to stone.<br/>
And rooted her there to the spot; and behold! the god was gone."<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Oat</span>, Bk. viii.<br/>
<br/>
These lines came to our recollection, and lost in thoughts,<br/>
partly of toilsome days of gymnasial study, and partly of the<br/>
magic world of the old Greeks, we stepped on the island<br/>
and climbed its side.<br/>
<br/>
The filth which covers the island is anything but poetic.<br/>
Two monks, in tattered blue frocks, bare-footed, with<br/>
long hair and unkempt beards, greeted the strangers.<br/>
<br/>
The church is of the true orthodox type; it is divided<br/>
