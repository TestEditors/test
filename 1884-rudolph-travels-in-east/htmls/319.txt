<br/>
According to Brugsch Pasha we were the first<br/>
Europeans who had visited the Pyramid of King Pepi since<br/>
it had been opened.<br/>
<br/>
Even in classical times the three great Pyramids of<br/>
Ghizeh were reckoned among the wonders of the world,<br/>
and they still excite the admiration of our own <span style="color: #0000FF;">bla</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">sie </span>contemporaries. The enormous mass of stone employed in<br/>
their construction, and its even distribution as provided for<br/>
in the execution of these gigantic monuments, has not its<br/>
equal anywhere else. The largest of the three Pyramids<br/>
was once four hundred and fifty-one feet in height. Its<br/>
cubic contents are estimated at not less than seventy-five<br/>
millions of cubic feet. It has been calculated that the<br/>
stone employed in building it would <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffice </span>to put a wall six<br/>
feet high all round France. The inscriptions name King<br/>
Chufu, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. the Cheops of classical authors, who ruled in<br/>
Egypt 3700 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C.</span>, as its builder. The Pyramid which his<br/>
son and successor, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chafra </span>(King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chephres </span>of Greek traditions), erected in a south-westerly direction from that of<br/>
his predecessor retains its old coating in the upper part.<br/>
<br/>
At its foot there existed a special sanctuary, in form<br/>
like a temple, and built of blocks of limestone, granite, and<br/>
alabaster, and which was connected, by a long road leading<br/>
to the east, with the so-called Temple of the Sphinx. The<br/>
remains of this road are in almost entire preservation, and<br/>
have been lately cleared from the sand of the desert. The<br/>
grounds of the Temple of the Sphinx, in which, at the bottom<br/>
of a now filled-up well, several statues of King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chafra </span>were<br/>
