than in Central Europe, as his word is law with all the<br/>
wild tribes. Formerly this was not so, for the Bedouins<br/>
were in constant strife and deadly warfare amongst<br/>
themselves, and to have the friendship of one tribe<br/>
sufficed to expose the traveller to the hostility of all<br/>
the others.<br/>
<br/>
The sage patriarch has now united almost all the tribes<br/>
under his rule, and the region whose nomad population<br/>
obeys him blindly is well-nigh boundless. Thousands of<br/>
horsemen, bold militant sons of the desert, do his bidding,<br/>
and a kind of caliphate has thus arisen. After brief<br/>
discourse Sheik Ali took ceremonious leave of us. A<br/>
dignified repose marks the <span style="color: #ff0000;">demeanour </span>of these people,<br/>
and a proud self-consciousness such as one seldom sees<br/>
in like measure in Europe. They then mounted their<br/>
noble steeds, and, surrounded by a faithful group of lancers,<br/>
the nomad king rode back to his boundless <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppes</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The governor of Nablous, a genuine Turcoman, <span style="color: #0000FF;">an<br/>
</span>agreeable and very cultivated man, and ever most<br/>
desirous to comply with our wishes, was also waiting for<br/>
us at the tents. He wore the robe of a Pasha, but on<br/>
account of the heat had white cloths stretched over<br/>
his fez.<br/>
<br/>
We breakfasted hastily; no one could eat much. The<br/>
air grew more oppressive towards midday, and persistent<br/>
and insatiable thirst extinguished all appetite in this<br/>
region, lying as it does below the level of the sea. After<br/>
a rest of one hour some of the travelling party broke<br/>
up to employ the afternoon and evening hours in the<br/>
chase.<br/>
