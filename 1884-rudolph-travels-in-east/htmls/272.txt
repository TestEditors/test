<span>160 TRAVELS IN <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in terror. Immediately after, seeing a black body bigger<br/>
than a wolf approach the lure, I took exact aim and fired.<br/>
A furious howl of pain followed the shot. I hastened to the<br/>
spot, but found only the track, which led to the mountains.<br/>
Vexed and disappointed at this, and convinced that I had<br/>
hit a <span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena</span>, we returned to the steamer. I desired my<br/>
huntsman to go out at daybreak next morning and follow<br/>
the track of the wounded beast<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>When we reached the steamer the other gentlemen<br/>
had already returned. The Grand Duke had seen jackals,<br/>
but unfortunately shot none, while Hoyos had been so<br/>
lucky as to kill one.<br/>
<br/>
On the 10th the sun stood high in the heavens ere I<br/>
awoke, and we had already been going down stream for<br/>
more than an hour. Asking for my huntsman, I learned<br/>
that he had found the wounded animal a few hundred steps<br/>
from where it had been shot; but it was, alas! no <span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena</span>,<br/>
but one of those half-savage and most vicious village dogs<br/>
which in Egypt wander the whole night through in the<br/>
neighbourhood of towns, looking for prey<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>My huntsman<br/>
saw also a very large lynx within a few steps of him, which<br/>
disappeared into a hole in the old wall of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Khb</span>.<br/>
<br/>
May I be allowed here to say a few words about the<br/>
race of dogs in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">P </span>I have made the curious observation that in this country the village dog, the African wolf<br/>
(Canis <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jupastee</span>), "<span style="color: #ff0000;">Abu-el-Hossain </span>"or "Dib" of the Arabs,<br/>
and the jackal (Canis aureus), <span style="color: #0000FF;">tt </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Talib</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>of the Egyptians and<br/>
"Waui "of the Syrians, mix races through cross breeding.<br/>
<br/>
We shot no two wolves nor any two jackals <span style="color: #0000FF;">which<br/>
</span>were entirely like one another, either in size or colour.<br/>
<br/>
