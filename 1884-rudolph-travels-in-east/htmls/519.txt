animal's run, stood right across its path. The wounded beast<br/>

rage. By good luck I had followed as fast as I could run,<br/>

scorching sunbeams was not too pleasant. When the sun<br/>
had gone down in orange mist behind the border hills we<br/>
had reached the forest and the shrubs, whence another<br/>
hour's walk had to be accomplished, Quails rose at every<br/>
