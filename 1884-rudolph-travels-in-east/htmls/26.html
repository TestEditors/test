<br/>
</span>whom I knew from a previous expedition to Corfu, was to<br/>
accompany us as physician.<br/>
<br/>
I took a hasty glance round the vessel of which I had<br/>
grown so fond-the cabins, my own quarters, and all the<br/>
places <span style="color: #0000FF;">associated.with </span>so many happy recollections.<br/>
<br/>
Wilczek had accompanied us, to the ship, on board<br/>
which he had two years before spent some pleasant days<br/>
with me. After dining with us he went on shore, and a<br/>
few minutes later waved, from the castle terrace, farewell<br/>
greetings to the departing ship.<br/>
<br/>
We all remained on deck enjoying the scenery. Castle<br/>
Duino, Miramar, the precipitous heights of Karst, and<br/>
the beautifully situated Trieste, as it lay in the sunlight,<br/>
seemed the first pleasant picture afforded by our journey.<br/>
We passed close to the Austrian squadron and the Russian<br/>
corvette <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ascoli</span>. Ships of war when they salute have<br/>
always a combative aspect. From the admiral's ship the<br/>
strains of our national air sounded, and as we came by the<br/>
Russian corvette we sent forth those of the solemn but<br/>
beautiful "Hymn to the Czar."<br/>
<br/>
Trieste soon vanished from our sight, and we steamed<br/>
south along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>Istrian coast. We remained for several<br/>
hours on deck. The temperature was really low, but<br/>
seemed to us deliciously balmy after the delights of a central<br/>
European winter. The arrangement of our cabins and<br/>
unpacking filled the afternoon, and a genial social life was<br/>
soon set on foot below deck. A late dinner shortened the<br/>
evening, and bed-time came quickly.<br/>
<br/>
A grey, cloudy sky, wind, and a rough sea and <span style="color: #ff0000;">lowered<br/>
<br/>
</span>temperature was what the morning of February <span style="color: #0000FF;">nth </span>had<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
