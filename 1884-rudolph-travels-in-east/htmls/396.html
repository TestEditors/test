<span>258 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

sabre was girt on his loins, while on his gloved hand stood<br/>
a noble falcon with a bright hood on its head. On foot,<br/>
horse, or camel, the crowd of Bedouins followed, armed<br/>
with long guns, sabres, and daggers--all in white flowing<br/>
robes. Brown martial forms they were, with most expressive faces. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Some </span>remarkably fine long-haired Asiatic<br/>
greyhounds accompanied their masters, and several young<br/>
falcons, not yet worthy of the master's hand, were carried<br/>
behind us.<br/>
<br/>
The tribe with which we were now moving through the<br/>
desert not far from the railway, has been wandering in<br/>
Africa for some time, but belongs properly to Arabia, as<br/>
one can easily tell from the noble stamp of the horses and<br/>
the richer armour and dress of the men. We rode in a<br/>
long loose line through the hills and vales of the desert.<br/>
Gazelles were to have been hunted, but we <span style="color: #0000FF;">should </span>have<br/>
been thankful to see even a desert <span style="color: #ff0000;">hare..<br/>
<br/>
</span>All efforts were fruitless for two hours. The Bedouins<br/>
began to ride forward impatiently, to search a wider field.<br/>
One of these suddenly started a gazelle out of some thick<br/>
shrubs, and away in wild disorder went every one after it;<br/>
the dogs were loosed, and as the scattered horsemen<br/>
gathered from all sides, some even riding up against the<br/>
fleeing animal, it no longer knew in what direction to make<br/>
for escape, and ran terrified round amongst the horses.<br/>
One Bedouin brought the chase to a speedy end; riding at<br/>
full gallop he sent a ball after the gazelle, which was rushing<br/>
away with irregular bounds, and laid the animal low in a<br/>
moment.<br/>
<br/>
The attempt to get a desert hare had next to be made;<br/>
