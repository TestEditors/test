<span>THE <span style="color: #ff0000;">MUSKL </span>47<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Muski, which begins at the Place Atab-el-Kadra, and continues almost to the tombs of the Caliphs. It is the artery<br/>
of Cairene Oriental life.<br/>
<br/>
Not very broad, irregularly built, unpaved, damp, and<br/>
dirty from the filth of all the drains which discharge into it,<br/>
the fighting-ground of innumerable savage dogs, covered<br/>
in with matting, filled with deafening noise, and saturated<br/>
with a disgusting stench, it affords a faithful picture of<br/>
the Eastern capital.<br/>
<br/>
Here may be seen every imaginable Eastern tribe, of<br/>
the most various <span style="color: #0000FF;">hues-men </span>with turbans in wide bright<br/>
dresses, soldiers, Bedouins, Jews in Biblical costume, Turks,<br/>
inhabitants of Asia Minor, Greeks, Midianites, Levantines,<br/>
and Armenians, rich and poor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellaheen </span>in blue shirts,<br/>
peasant women with babes at the breast, wealthy women<br/>
on donkeys followed and guarded by their eunuchs, riders on<br/>
camels, mules laden with merchandise, dark Nubians, pure<br/>
negroes, Mohammedan processions, solemn dervishes, men<br/>
of business, mutilated beggars, water-carriers with their<br/>
goatskin bottles on their backs-all moving up and down<br/>
in bewildering confusion.<br/>
<br/>
The deafening noise tries the ear of the European. To<br/>
the roar of the crowd are added the piteous moans of the<br/>
beggars, the cries of the dealers, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">think </span>of money, the<br/>
clatter of cups, the bragging vaunts of the hawkers and<br/>
of the coffee-sellers, the bellowing of the camels, the barking<br/>
of dogs, the warning cry of the donkey-drivers and of the<br/>
sais as he <span style="color: #ff0000;">ruris </span>before the carriages.<br/>
<br/>
New sights present themselves to the stranger at every<br/>
turn, and all this endless movement goes on from early<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
