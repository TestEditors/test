came to the edge of the plateau, where a steep slope fell<br/>
before me. At the bottom of this I discerned, to my great<br/>
joy, green meadow and rich pasture, and among these the<br/>
silver streak of the Jordan, which makes a considerable<br/>
bend at this spot. The peninsula so formed is covered<br/>
with an underwood richer and more luxuriant than any<br/>
that I had seen before. On the border of this wood, in the<br/>
shadow of its last trees and bushes, but still on the meadow,<br/>
we took our rest, let the horses graze, and unpacked a<br/>
modest luncheon, consisting of bread and cold meat, after<br/>
having first bathed in the cool rushing waves. Here as<br/>
elsewhere in its course the Jordan maintains the character<br/>
of a mountain stream, and foams away between the rocks<br/>
and over big stones. After our frugal meal I resolved to<br/>
examine the underwood, and perhaps to get up a little<br/>
beating.<br/>
<br/>
The first half of this peninsula is covered with shrubs<br/>
something over man's height; the ground is thickly over-.<br/>
grown with <span style="color: #0000FF;">large-leaved </span>plants of all kinds, and the bushes<br/>
are closely bound together with creepers. The whole combination is so thick and luxuriant that it is difficult to<br/>
penetrate, and every forward step demands the exercise of<br/>
a man's whole strength.<br/>
<br/>
When the first part is successfully passed you come to a<br/>
clearing dividing the wood into two halves. Here I found<br/>
in the loam an incredible number of fresh tracks-traces<br/>
of the panther, the lynx, the wild cat, the wild boar and<br/>
porcupine; the wolf, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackal</span>, and two kinds of deer<br/>
were also represented. These tracks of a small <span style="color: #0000FF;">roe-like<br/>
</span>and of a larger fallow deer interested us very much, and<br/>
