<br/>
surging waters from the sea have mingled with the currents<br/>
from the mouths of the Nile, and made that large basin of<br/>
shallow water with its many islands which extends from<br/>
Damietta to Port Said, and now bears the general name of<br/>
the Lakes of Menzaleh. The waters of these lakes are, or<br/>
rather were, in communication at this southern corner with<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dattel </span>Sea (Birket-el-ballah); southward in the same<br/>
direction <span style="color: #0000FF;">came</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>The Threshold,' El-Gisr, of which we spoke<br/>
above. The waters of the Red Sea fed the basin of the<br/>
next following Crocodile Lake (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Birketrel-Timsah</span>) and the<br/>
Bitter Lakes, which were in direct connection with the<br/>
Gulf of Suez by means of the strip of <span style="color: #0000FF;">canal </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>Crocodile's Tail.' It is therefore no wonder that the position<br/>
of these lakes between the two seas and near the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile<br/>
</span>awoke in the very early period of Egyptian history the<br/>
idea of connecting the lakes by a canal with the river, and<br/>
so indirectly restoring the communication between the<br/>
Mediterranean and the Red Sea.<br/>
<br/>
"According to classical tradition Ramses II. (Sesostris,<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sestura </span>of inscriptions) was the first king who made a<br/>
navigable waterway by a canal from the Pelusian arm of<br/>
the Nile to the Crocodile Lake. This canal traversed<br/>
the natural depressed level of Wadi <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ttrmiliit</span>. The ruins of<br/>
towns and monuments which have perished, but which bear<br/>
the name of this king, place the existence of this canal<br/>
beyond all doubt. In later times the canal appears to have<br/>
fallen in, and been dried up until 600 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.c.</span>, when King<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">echo </span>made a plan to restore the connection between the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>and the Red Sea<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>He however abandoned his enterprise (in <span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12,000 </span>Egyptian labourers perished) <span style="color: #0000FF;">when<br/>
