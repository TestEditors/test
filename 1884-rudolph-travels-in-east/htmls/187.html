<span>ARAB MUSIC--THE BEE-DANCE. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ill<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>wild, confusion of sounds, passing back after a few joyful<br/>
chords into gloomy tones again.<br/>
<br/>
In the south of Spain, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">Moors </span>abound, I heard,<br/>
especially amongst the gipsies, the same concerts; and the<br/>
music with which the southern <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sclaves </span>accompany their<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">gloomy </span>songs of heroes, as they squat in winter evenings<br/>
round the fire, and dream of the long-past days of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Kraljewic </span>Marko, is in its essential form the same as the<br/>
wild strains which in Girgeh summoned to the merry dance.<br/>
<br/>
The first notes resounded, and the dancers appeared<br/>
in their long, tight-fitting, bright garments, with slender<br/>
figures, their coin necklaces round their necks, and their<br/>
faces, as a matter of course, unveiled. A pretty <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mooress<br/>
</span>and a pale Circassian contrasted with the others, who<br/>
represented the pure fellaheen type. The features-the<br/>
wide nostrils, the low forehead, the sharply defined nose,<br/>
and the small mouth-are the same that we see in the<br/>
characteristic likenesses of the ancient <span style="color: #ff0000;">Egyptians..<br/>
<br/>
</span>These dancers are a hereditary caste, despised by the<br/>
devout Moslems. They were banished from Lower Egypt<br/>
because of their dangerously seductive and irregular lives.<br/>
Now they frequent all the towns of Upper Egypt, to which<br/>
part of the country they originally belonged.<br/>
<br/>
They generally live all together in remote quarters of<br/>
the town, and exhibit themselves for money among the<br/>
poorer classes of the population, and before curious<br/>
strangers. They are also a good deal employed in the<br/>
houses of the wealthy, where, after feasts and banquets,<br/>
while the pleasant chibouk and nargili are smoked, the<br/>
bee-dance is considered a great attraction.<br/>
