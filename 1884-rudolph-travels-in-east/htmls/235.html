north, follow each other in the prescribed order up to the<br/>
holy of holies, in which still stands to-day the stone<br/>
chapel of the divinity, which dates from the times of the<br/>
last national Pharaoh.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, we must note that, according to the<br/>
inscriptions, the whole building was erected after old<br/>
designs in the time of the Ptolemaic kings, from the<br/>
year 237 to 142 <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C.</span>, and therefore took ninety-five years<br/>
to complete.<br/>
<br/>
After we had seen all the parts of the temple we<br/>
mounted to the flat roof, and enjoyed thence a fine view<br/>
towards the Nile and the green plain, and across a broad<br/>
desert, beginning near the temple, to the pyramidal-shaped<br/>
sandstone mountains beyond <span style="color: #ff0000;">it..<br/>
<br/>
</span>As vultures were circling above us, I placed a carcase<br/>
behind a heap of ruins, and waited on the battlements<br/>
of the temple the coming of the great birds of prey.<br/>
Unluckily only carrion vultures came, and I had to<br/>
content myself with this poor stuff, as time pressed for'<br/>
our voyage. We rode back through the odious village<br/>
by the same way that we came, to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">landing-place<br/>
<br/>
</span>A few minutes later our ship was steaming up stream:<br/>
The country continued uniform. The eastern Arab<br/>
mountains were here of a greyish white, low, and much<br/>
broken in outline. They came so close to the river as<br/>
to leave <span style="color: #0000FF;">Init </span>a very narrow strip of land for cultivation<br/>
--sometimes none at all<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">s</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>The western Libyan mountains were also low, and<br/>
yellowish <span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>colour, and grotesque and wild in shape.<br/>
South of Edfu they draw constantly nearer to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile<br/>
<br/>
