<br/>
traveller, the great alabaster mosque Gama Mehmet Ali,<br/>
rises in the centre of the citadel. It was built by the<br/>
famous founder of the present dynasty, the valorous<br/>
Mehmet Ali, on the site of an old ruined palace. Visible<br/>
from afar, the slender minarets soar upwards, an emblem of<br/>
Cairo. After we had put on the slippers which lay ready,<br/>
we entered the colossal building. The size of the square<br/>
chamber, the lofty cupola, and the various smaller ones<br/>
around, and the walls lined with the yellow alabaster of <span style="color: #ff0000;">BeniSuef</span>, impress one at first sight; but on closer examination<br/>
one feels how inferior the architectural details are to those<br/>
of the old mosques. The fountains, too, are heavy and<br/>
without beauty. Some handsome rugs for kneeling worshippers, and the richly decorated praying-place turned to<br/>
Mecca, drew our attention to the south-eastern side of the<br/>
building, where, beside this holy spot of the Moslem, the<br/>
sarcophagus of Mehmet Ali stands. It is covered with<br/>
rich gold-embroidered curtains, and surrounded by a railing.<br/>
At the head, in accordance with the precepts of their creed,<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>a stone turban is <span style="color: #ff0000;">fixed</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>We were allowed to pass inside the railing to look at<br/>
the coffin which contains the remains of the great man.<br/>
The son of a scavenger of Kawala, a thorough soldier<br/>
and Oriental, wild and undisciplined, of iron energy, and<br/>
cruel withal, but endowed with great gifts of intellect,<br/>
was called to found an empire, a caliphate of the olden<br/>
time. He marched through Palestine at the head of his<br/>
valiant <span style="color: #0000FF;">army</span>, taking as his exemplar Alexander the Great.<br/>
Had not the Western powers intervened, the rebellious<br/>
Pasha would undoubtedly have marched to Stamboul to<br/>
