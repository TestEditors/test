father speaks with his son while he spake thus:'Behold<br/>
me, and consider me well, thou my son Thutmes. I am thy<br/>
father <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hormachu</span>, the god <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cheper-Ra-Tum</span>. The kingdom shall be given to thee; thou shalt wear the crown of<br/>
Egypt on the throne of the god of the earth Keb; the whole<br/>
earth shall belong to thee, in its breadth and length, lighted<br/>
by the beaming eye of the Lord of all. The riches from<br/>
the interior of the land, and many tributes from all people,<br/>
shall belong to thee, and thou shalt rejoice in length of life<br/>
for many years. The best shall be thy portion, for my face<br/>
is turned to thee, and my heart belongs to thee. The sand<br/>
of the desert on which I have my being has covered me<br/>
up. Answer me, that thou wilt do that which is my wish.<br/>
Then shall I know that thou art my son and defender.<br/>
Come nearer, let me be united to thee.'<br/>

heard was repeated. He understood the word of this<br/>
god, and kept it to himself in his heart while he thus spake:<br/>
' In very deed I see the dwellers in the temples of the town<br/>
of Memphis, how they bring sacrifices to this god without<br/>
doing anything to protect from the sands the work o',;<br/>
King <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chafra</span>, the image which he has set up to the god<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tum-Hormachu</span>...<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>"<br/>
<br/>
The text is injured here, and has become illegible.<br/>
The conclusion is nevertheless easy to guess. Thutmes has<br/>
the Sphinx cleared of sand, and is in consequence crowned<br/>
King of Egypt. The fact is of small historic <span style="color: #0000FF;">value</span>, but all<br/>
the more interesting is the deduction that even in the<br/>
sixteenth century B.C. the body of the Sphinx lay as now,<br/>
half buried in deep sand<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
