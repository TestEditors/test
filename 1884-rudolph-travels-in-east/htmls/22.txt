<br/>
On the 9th February our travelling party assembled at<br/>
the Southern station in Vienna. It was a cold, bleak, winter<br/>
evening. Snow lay in the streets, and thick clouds covered<br/>
the sky; right gloomy weather for departure, and such as<br/>
our treacherous climate too often bids our poor European<br/>
race <span style="color: #ff0000;">endure..<br/>
<br/>
</span>But two days before I had left the railway, after a long<br/>
and rapid journey from the distant west of Europe. I had<br/>
hastened home to follow a faithful friend on his last journey<br/>
to his long home. With this saddening thought I stepped<br/>
into the carriage The cold we then endured alone filled<br/>
us with pleasant <span style="color: #0000FF;">anticipations-for </span>soon it must give place<br/>
to the glorious warmth of the glowing East. A whistle,<br/>
and the train moved <span style="color: #0000FF;">puffing </span>out of the station. It was<br/>
pitch dark outside; snow, sleet, and storm were our<br/>
farewell.<br/>
<br/>
A small but enterprising travelling party were assembled<br/>
in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sleeping-can </span>My uncle, the Grand Duke of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Tus..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">cany</span>, General Count Waldburg, the Court Chaplain, Abbot<br/>
Mayer, Major von <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eschenbacher</span>, Count Joseph Hoyos,<br/>
the artist Pausinger and I, were the pilgrims of the East.<br/>
Count Hans Wilczek accompanied us to the sea, whence<br/>
his way lay to Italy. One after another soon retired to<br/>
rest, and only Wilczek and I remained engaged in conversation, until at length, far on into the night, sleep<br/>
overcame us also.<br/>
<br/>
The icy cold awoke the travellers in the early morning,<br/>
and shivering we drew closer to each other. The guard<br/>
told us that the thermometer showed twenty degrees of<br/>
cold, and the frosted, palm-like foliage on the windows<br/>
