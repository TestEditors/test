the gods were brought. And the gods cast themselves<br/>
on either side of him to the ground, to do their homage to<br/>
his majesty, that he might say his sayings <span style="color: #0000FF;">before </span>the<br/>
father of the oldest gods, who had made men and begotten<br/>
the nobles. And they spake thus to his <span style="color: #0000FF;">majesty </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">l</span>' Speak<br/>

full of dread because of my nearness.'<br/>
