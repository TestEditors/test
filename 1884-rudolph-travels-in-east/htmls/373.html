<br/>
which the upper part of the body was thrown backwards<br/>
and forwards; these dervishes called, moaned, groaned,<br/>
and howled the same words in quite inarticulate sounds.<br/>
The whole scene was painfully dismal. The men wore<br/>
long bright robes like dressing-gowns, with a simple cord<br/>
round the waist. In contrast to all other Moslems they<br/>
had no covering on the head, and long shaggy <span style="color: #0000FF;">hair.and<br/>
</span>beards. When they threw their bodies backwards the hair<br/>
reached the ground, and when they pitched forward the<br/>
hair fell in wild disorder over their faces. Their eyes<br/>
turned, and their bodies twitched convulsively, and foam<br/>
and froth covered their lips; one big man especially, with a<br/>
black beard, was a type of the wildest fanatical ecstasy.<br/>
<br/>
We did not stay long in this oppressive atmosphere,<br/>
and the old high priest and all his <span style="color: #0000FF;">underlines </span>followed us<br/>
out. In the open air they all covered their heads, for the<br/>
most part with brown caps, and proceeded to serve some<br/>
very unsatisfactory coffee in their primitive arbour.<br/>
<br/>
I inquired their descent. Like the turning dervishes,<br/>
they all spoke Turkish; none of them were Arabs. The<br/>
old high priest was from Greece, a pure Osmanli. The<br/>
others were Turks from Stamboul, Roumelia, and the other<br/>
Balkan provinces; Moslems, too, from the Crimea and Asia<br/>
Minor, and one Kurd from Bagdad, with a huge green<br/>
turban, were present<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>We took leave after a short stay and drove back to<br/>
Kasr-en-Nusha. Time pressed, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>we were to appear on<br/>
this day, without uniform, at a small private dinner at the<br/>
Khedive's. We came home soon after dinner, as the<br/>
Viceroy had to go in the evening to the Hussein Mosque<br/>
