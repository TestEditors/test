<span>42 <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRAVELS </span>IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I frequently saw several persons at a time go through<br/>
this pious <span style="color: #0000FF;">purification</span>, and the little basin has neither intake<br/>
nor outlet! In all the corridors, courts, and halls of the<br/>
mosque, throngs of people pass in and out, often most<br/>
striking in appearance in their long robes; and frightful<br/>
cripples wait and implore your charity. As we left the<br/>
mosque, an old man with snowy beard and robes of rich<br/>
Oriental stuff, and wearing the green turban in token of<br/>
descent from the Prophet, rode to the doors, dismounted<br/>
from his richly <span style="color: #0000FF;">caparisoned </span>horse, which he gave to the<br/>
servant who followed, and entered the house of prayer with<br/>
an air of dignity.<br/>
<br/>
This distinguished Oriental was a picture-as it were, a<br/>
study-just such as I had always imagined the sages in the<br/>
gorgeous fables of the East.<br/>
<br/>
Our way led next to the famous mosque Gama-el-Azhar.<br/>
Its date is that of Cairo itself. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dj6har</span>, the general of<br/>
Caliph Muizz, began <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>structure. The description of<br/>
this hoary building demands that we should look back at<br/>
the history of Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
When Amr ibn el-Asi, the general of Caliph Omar in<br/>
683 A.D., had taken the Castle of Babylon on the site of the<br/>
present Old Cairo, and was about to proceed against <span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria</span>, the story goes that a dove had built her nest on the<br/>
tent which he had occupied during the siege, and begun to<br/>
breed. Amr commanded, therefore, that the tent (Arabic,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fostrit</span>) should not be struck.<br/>
<br/>
He returned to the tent after he had taken Alexandria,<br/>
and founded here a city, which bore the name of the tent.<br/>
Amr himself built the mosque, which is called after him<br/>
<br/>
