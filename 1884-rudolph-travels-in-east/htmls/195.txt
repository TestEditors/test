their beautiful outlines and lofty summits. I proceeded<br/>
to roam over this plain in quest of a suitable spot,<br/>

In the days of the Roman emperors a legion had<br/>
perished here of disease and privation. The bodies of<br/>
the Roman warriors still lie unburied in wild confusion.<br/>
One may speak literally of bodies, for the African sun,<br/>

fierce reflection of the burning sun on the white and yellow<br/>
masses of stone, and the waste of sand rising in sharp<br/>
outlines against the deep-blue sky. There is an undeniable<br/>
poetry in these monotonous but majestic scenes. At<br/>
last I found a low hill which appeared to offer the<br/>
desired cover for our unobserved approach, and so I<br/>
