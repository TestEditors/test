</span>in these meadows, too, the voice of the Lord was heard"Thou art My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."<br/>
<br/>
Great processions of faithful pilgrims come year by<br/>
year to bathe in the Jordan and bear back some of its<br/>
water for the baptism of their children. The orthodox<br/>
bathe in the sacred river in the same garment which they<br/>
propose to reserve for the day of their death.<br/>
<br/>
Strengthened and refreshed by our bath, we hastened,<br/>
followed by the Bedouins, to retrace our path up the wild<br/>
boar track, across the bottom of the valley, and up to the<br/>
edge of the plateau from which we had descended. We<br/>
mounted our horses, and, under Salim's guidance, rode full<br/>
gallop athwart the steppe. Near the entrance of the<br/>
narrow valley of <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Audie </span>the governor and some gendarmes met us. Our long delay <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the direction we had<br/>
taken towards the Jordan had made him uneasy, and he<br/>
had come out to look for us. The spot where we had<br/>
begun our sport in the morning had to be passed, and then<br/>
we turned towards the interior of the valley, which is<br/>
clothed with rich verdure, while the hills that enclose it<br/>
maintain the same character as the rest of the border<br/>
mountains-long steep slopes scantily covered with grass.<br/>
Our narrow and seemingly interminable path led us up<br/>
the valley through thick and thorny bush, now and again<br/>
crossing to the opposite bank of a stony brook. Innumerable storks stood on the steeps. I have never seen such<br/>
quantities of these birds assembled in one spot as here,<br/>
notably in the valley of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Audje</span>, and generally in the<br/>
whole of the plain of the Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
After a prolonged ride we at length reached our camp.<br/>
