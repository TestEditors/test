<span>82 TRAVELS IN <span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and promptly after our arrival an excellent dinner, prepared<br/>
by an Arab cook, was <span style="color: #0000FF;">served </span>to us in one of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">tents</span>, fitted<br/>
up as a dining-room.<br/>
<br/>
The tents were made of pretty material, and were extremely comfortable. There was one for every two gentlemen, and beds, and even tables, were provided in the<br/>
airy dwellings. None but Easterns really understand how<br/>
to cook out of doors, and to pitch tents quickly and<br/>
comfortably, therefore let all who can travel among<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
After dinner we talked, Smoked, and made our plans for<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">next </span>day, and by ten o'clock silence reigned in the<br/>
camp. The Arabs lay around on the sand, in the open<br/>
air, looking like ghosts in their white burnous.<br/>
<br/>
The night did not pass so smoothly as the beautiful<br/>
evening had led us to expect. A violent storm rose and<br/>
swept roughly over the tents. Hassan, the dragoman, stole<br/>
from tent to tent, and drove the stakes more firmly in. In<br/>
my uncle's tent and mine, for we were put up together, the<br/>
wind carried one side of the tent away. The cool air woke<br/>
us, and we lay admiring the starry sky smiling down on our<br/>
dormitory. All damage was fortunately soon repaired, and<br/>
towards morning the force of the storm abated.<br/>
<br/>
Very early, before sunrise, we breakfasted; we wished<br/>
to disperse along the shore of the island to watch the flight<br/>
of the water-fowl, and select suitable points for our<br/>
stations.<br/>
<br/>
We had scarcely left the tents when we saw many flocks<br/>
of birds on the wing: cormorants, various <span style="color: #0000FF;">ducks</span>, herons,<br/>
and pelicans. These last look extremely comic. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Their<br/>
