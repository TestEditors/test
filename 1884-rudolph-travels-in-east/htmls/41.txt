<span>THE CANAL OF ZANTE. <span style="color: #ff0000;">II<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>We could now look at the lovely scenery at our leisure.<br/>
To eastward, beyond the level coast, the whole chain of the<br/>
Greek mountains lay before us-those of Peloponnesus,<br/>
Patras, Achaia, and Elis, their higher peaks covered with<br/>
snow. On the north lay the bleak Cephalonia. To the<br/>
west Zante; this lovely island embellished, like the others,<br/>
by finely formed rocky mountains, has also plains rich as<br/>
gardens, and hills of luxuriant verdure. Corfu is more<br/>
pleasing, more cultivated, and would be pleasanter to reside<br/>
in, but Zante is <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flower </span>of the Levant," as the Italians<br/>
say.<br/>
<br/>
The town stretches widely round the bay. The white<br/>
houses with <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rai</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>roofs, the many churches and towers which<br/>
stand apart beside them, the Castle Hill and its little<br/>
citadel, each and all set in the richest vegetation, make a<br/>
lovely picture.<br/>
<br/>
We soon anchored in front of the town; several other<br/>
vessels sheltering as we did from the storm shared our lot.<br/>
After the doctor's visit we rowed on shore. Zante has a<br/>
character of its own, and is not without interest. There<br/>
are traces of former prosperity; now, the pavement and the<br/>
dirt baffle description. Many of the streets have flights of<br/>
steps in them, and are only meant for foot passengers; all,<br/>
without exception, are very narrow. Pigs wallow in the<br/>
principal square, and the whole town is pervaded by an<br/>
undefinable stench. Many of the houses-some of them<br/>
fine old buildings, which recall the Italian palaces-are<br/>
destitute of window glass, or at most a <span style="color: #ff0000;">sihgle </span>shutter hangs<br/>
dangling in the wind as the only ornament. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">churches<br/>
<br/>
</span>are the chief ornament of the town. They are genuine old<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
