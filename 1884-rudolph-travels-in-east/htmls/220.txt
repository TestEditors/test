<span>128 TRAVELS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It was a lucky chance that led to our meeting the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ababdehs </span>in Thebes, for they seldom come to the fairs<br/>
in this town. In Assuan we were to learn to know them<br/>
better.<br/>
<br/>
After this interesting episode the travelling party<br/>
divided. The Grand Duke and I rode out again to<br/>
Karnak to hunt wild beasts in the evening, while the other<br/>
gentlemen remained in Luxor. An Arab hunter, Chalil<br/>
by name, guided us to the vicinity of the ruins of<br/>
Karnak. Just by the first houses of the little village we<br/>
turned into the fields, and soon reached a sand-hill, on<br/>
which stood the grave of an old Mohammedan sheik.<br/>
<br/>
We were posted by the Arab at two different points, in<br/>
the shade of a small palm-grove, with instructions to have<br/>
our guns ready and wait in absolute stillness for coming<br/>
events. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">champsin </span>had fallen in the afternoon, and a<br/>
beautiful evening followed the bad day. The sun went<br/>
down gloriously, steeping the wide Theban plain, the<br/>
mountains of the desert-specially lofty here-and the<br/>
magnificent ruins of Karnak, in the most glowing colours.<br/>
A gentle breeze moved the tops of the palms, the luxuriant<br/>
plants gave forth balsamic <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours</span>, the doves cooed<br/>
plaintively among the shrubs, the stillness of all around<br/>
was a sedative to me, and I went fast asleep. Suddenly<br/>
Chalil, who was lurking hard by, shook me roughly, and<br/>
told me in sharp tones that I had missed a jackal which<br/>
had marched by. It had meanwhile grown dark, and the<br/>
Grand Duke and I set out on our return.<br/>
<br/>
On the way back across the fields I perceived the form<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>beast passing rapidly. I fired on chance, and found, <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
