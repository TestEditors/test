its desert tribes, comes far behind Morocco on the one<br/>
hand, and Asia on the other-for Asia also in its south..<br/>
western part is inhabited by Semitic Arabs. Towards<br/>
midday tillage reappeared, a verdant moist spot in the<br/>
midst of the yellow sands. This was the great oasis of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Fayum</span>; downright good land, well cultivated, circular<br/>
in shape, and surrounded on all sides by desert. The great<br/>
lake of Birket-el-Karun forms the western boundary and<br/>
division of the cultivated land from the desert. We passed<br/>
through a small portion of this well-tended bountiful oasis,<br/>
which was planted with sugar-cane, and reached the station<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abuskar</span>. We had come to the extreme point of the<br/>
railway. A ruinous station, not unsuited to the interior of<br/>
Africa, and some buildings belonging to it, form, together<br/>
with the sugar-factory, a small settlement.<br/>
<br/>
Let no one suppose that a sugar-factory means an<br/>
establishment on a European scale, such as we find in<br/>
Bohemia; it is merely a very simple and somewhat neglected building in which the produce of the large sugar-cane<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">fieliis </span>is turned to account. Some low chimneys justify the<br/>
appellation of factory.<br/>
<br/>
We breakfasted quickly in the more than primitive<br/>
waiting-room of the station, and then hastened to put our<br/>
caravan in order. This is no easy task in the East, for<br/>
every one presses his services, his horse, his ass, with the<br/>
utmost <span style="color: #0000FF;">vehemence</span>; one pushes the other aside, and all yell<br/>
and gesticulate, till at last the poor deafened stranger<br/>
throws himself into the arms of the first comer. With the<br/>
help of some soldiers, and thanks to the solidity of our<br/>
sticks, chaos was soon reduced to order.<br/>
