<span>210 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
At Lake Menzaleh I could really not believe myself<br/>
to be still in the Egypt hitherto so rich in colour. The<br/>
weather was not favourable either; the moisture of the sea<br/>
was perceptible, and a disagreeable cold wind made sport<br/>
with the grey rain-clouds, and the whole sky was veiled in<br/>
gloom. Here we seemed to be in the north once more,<br/>
and we thought with sorrow of the never-to-be-forgotten<br/>
sun of Assuan. This very unlovely lake might just as well<br/>
have been appended to one of the plains of Northern<br/>
Europe; it was dull and tiresome enough to have filled<br/>
the position worthily.<br/>
<br/>
A flotilla of small sailing <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiy√© </span>lay in front of<br/>
the fishing cottages. I think that the reef pirate of<br/>
antiquity <span style="color: #0000FF;">can </span>have used no worse boats; our Istrian<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">trabakels </span>are frigates compared with them. We had to<br/>
choose for ourselves among these wretched vessels. The<br/>
Grand Duke, Baron Saurma, the chaplain, and I took<br/>
possession of the biggest, and two gentlemen went in<br/>
each of the others. Another followed as cook's galley,<br/>
and in it went the provender and the cook.<br/>
<br/>
It will suffice to describe the arrangement of one of<br/>
these boats. They were all of them bad. In front there<br/>
was a platform round the mast; on this were some cane<br/>
seats and a small table. Here the day had to be spent,<br/>
and here at night the two huntsmen and the crew had to<br/>
sleep. On lifting the hatch you opened a small receptacle<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">f </span>which served to store the luggage. In the centre of<br/>
the vessel, down two steps, there was a small cabin with<br/>
glass windows. This cabin was divided into two <span style="color: #0000FF;">parts-in </span>the outer there were two narrow beds and <span style="color: #0000FF;">nothing<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
