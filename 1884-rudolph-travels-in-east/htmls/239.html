</span>A NIGHT AT <span style="color: #0000FF;">KUAI </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">0MBU</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">141<br/>

</span>and I crept up the steep bank, and, groping through the<br/>
deserted temple, found on its east side a pillar which<br/>
afforded cover. <span style="color: #0000FF;">.The </span>wailing kid was'tied up a few steps<br/>
in front, and we watched for two hours with the closest<br/>
attention. Nothing stirred. It was a weird though<br/>
beautiful scene. The old temple with its gloomy corridors, the eternal desert unbroken save by a few ruins<br/>
and stones, and illuminated by the splendid moon of<br/>
Africa-not the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pallid </span>night-lamp moonshine of Europe,<br/>
but a daylight brilliance by which you could see the<br/>
smallest pebble, and which gave clear vision not only<br/>
to the watchful sportsman but also to the artist at his<br/>
work.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately the Europeans from the dahabiya were<br/>
out hunting near our ambush, and came back past the<br/>
temple with the cackling hens they had taken with them<br/>
as decoy; so our best hopes vanished, and we too hastened<br/>
back to our steamer.<br/>

The memory of that moonlight night in Kum <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ombti<br/>
</span>(i.e. the hill of Ombu, hieroglyphic Nubi, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. "the town<br/>
of gold," Greek Ombos) can <span style="color: #0000FF;">never </span>be forgotten, with the<br/>
extraordinarily picturesque remains of its half-buried<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">temple-the </span>metropolis of the district called later <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ombites</span>.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">own </span>and temple were hated by other Egyptians, for<br/>
here Set, the old Egyptian Typhon, was worshipped in<br/>
one of his chief embodiments. For this reason numerous<br/>
representations of the crocodile, the animal dedicated to<br/>
this deity, are found here, and it is also repeatedly mentioned in the inscriptions.<br/>
<br/>
At sunrise we left the beautiful Kum Ombu, and<br/>
