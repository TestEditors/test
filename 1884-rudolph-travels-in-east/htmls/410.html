<span>268 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
through fearful <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours</span>. The church is ancient, but neither<br/>
beautiful nor interesting. On entering we kissed the relics,<br/>
and were exhorted to say a prayer lying on the ground.<br/>
At every step in the Holy Land you are shown places to<br/>
which sacred legends are attached, and Jaffa has some of<br/>
its own. The dark church, dating from the Middle Ages,<br/>
the dim light of the torches, the hoarse chant of the<br/>
Franciscans, the droning of the organ, and all on the soil<br/>
of Palestine, wakes thoughts of the days of the Crusades,<br/>
when many a brave warrior from the far West received here<br/>
a first benediction on consecrated ground, ere he sought in<br/>
mailed steel on his war-horse battle with the swift son of<br/>
the desert, who, brave and proud, defended his <span style="color: #0000FF;">fatherland<br/>
</span>against the foreign invader.<br/>
<br/>
The benediction and music over, we made our way<br/>
with difficulty through the troops of gazers who blocked<br/>
the narrow corridors and stairs. Close and foul air is a<br/>
characteristic of such stone cellar-like rooms, be they house,<br/>
convent, or church. Let every one beware, especially in<br/>
spring, of dwelling under a roof in Palestine.<br/>
<br/>
Our horses were at the gate. It was no small task to<br/>
get the caravan together in the crowd of <span style="color: #0000FF;">people-noisy<br/>
</span>Orientals and numbers of Jews. It was done at last. A<br/>
division of Turkish cavalry opened the march, we and our<br/>
servants followed, and soldiers again brought up the rear.<br/>
In this order we rode through some narrow streets paved<br/>
with smooth plaster instead of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rags</span>, past the market-place<br/>
with its superabounding filth, and out of the town. The<br/>
road lies at first among gardens, thick hedges, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruitful<br/>
</span>orange-groves. The trees were bowed under the load <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
