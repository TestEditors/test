cultivated land. All Orientals are unpunctual, and so<br/>
it was long before our men appeared to put out the boat.<br/>
Only half awake, they blundered up and down the strand,<br/>
and it took time and trouble to bring chaos into order.<br/>
<br/>
After a while the party, consisting of the gentlemen, the<br/>
huntsmen, and the dogs, were got into three boats. Our<br/>
Arabs <span style="color: #ff0000;">roived </span>in their usual style, chanting songs with<br/>
hoarse voices. The smell in the boats was well-nigh<br/>
intolerable.<br/>
<br/>
Happily the lake lay smooth and still before us, <span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span>, in<br/>
such boats, with the drowsy Arabs, and in the pitch-dark<br/>
night, we might have had some unpleasant experiences in<br/>
the event of a storm. After an hour's voyage, we reached<br/>
the shore at a point where a headland, formed of a tolerably<br/>
large mass of rock, stretched into the sea, and is only connected with the mainland by a very narrow neck. Here<br/>
we went on shore, and sent the Arabs with the boat to the<br/>
back of the rock. It took some time before our vigorous<br/>
and emphatic instructions reduced our brown companions<br/>
to silence; but there was no time to lose; there must<br/>
soon be perfect stillness on the neck of land, for the day<br/>
began to break from the east. We made short work-hunted the Arabs into their hiding-place, and left Osman<br/>
behind to mount guard.<br/>
<br/>
We ranged ourselves apart all along the neck of land<br/>
and by the rock, crouching behind the thick shrubs or big<br/>
stones. With the dawn the passage of the water-fowl began.<br/>
The herons were the first. Next came the cormorants.<br/>
Then ducks, <span style="color: #ff0000;">pelicans</span>, sea-mews, the smaller sand-birds<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>some moor buzzards, and river eagles. Many shots were<br/>
