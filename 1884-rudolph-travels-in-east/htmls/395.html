The houses of Ismailia appeared on the sandy shores to<br/>
the north, and our steamer soon reached the quay of the<br/>
great French Suez Canal station. M. Lesseps, the famous<br/>
originator and founder of this gigantic work, which unites<br/>
two seas, awaited us with his son and several <span style="color: #0000FF;">officials </span>of the<br/>
French company. Iwas very glad to make the acquaintance of this still vigorous, laborious, and inflexible old man.<br/>
We drove to his charming country-house, situated in a small<br/>
garden. His beautiful daughter-in-law, a Cairene Greek of<br/>
the wealthy family Sinadino, received us there. Her brother,<br/>

present. We dined soon after our arrival, and the evening<br/>
passed in cheerful social intercourse.<br/>

We started very early next morning, M. Lesseps at our<br/>
head, and took the railway for a short distance in the<br/>
direction of Cairo to the station of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Maksama</span>. We halted<br/>
there, but had difficulty in getting our numerous horses out<br/>
of the train. The excited creatures neighed and plunged<br/>
about, and much time was lost in the preparations for our<br/>
hunt. A tribe of hunting Bedouins had pitched their tents<br/>
near the station, and at our arrival these magnificent men<br/>
came out of their resting-places. They came on horses<br/>
and camels, the sheik in front, riding an exquisite chestnut<br/>
mare.<br/>
<br/>
M. Lesseps had been so good as to invite this tribe,<br/>
which is renowned for skill in the chase, to the neighbourhood of Ismailia, that we might see a Bedouin hunt for the<br/>
gazelle. The ride through the desert was in truth most<br/>
picturesque. The sheik was in front, in a pure <span style="color: #0000FF;">white<br/>
</span>burnous. His saddle trappings were handsome, a curved<br/>
