<span>'126 TRAVELS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">THE </span>EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>town on the eastern bank of the river bore the<br/>
special name of Api, or with the article T-api, whence the<br/>
Greek name Thebai = Thebae, has originated.<br/>
<br/>
"The ruins remaining on this side, which have been<br/>
christened by the modern Egyptian inhabitants, <span style="color: #ff0000;">EI-Lugsor<br/>
</span>(i.e. the castles, usually written Luxor), and Karnak elicit<br/>
even now the <span style="color: #ff0000;">liveliest </span>admiration. In Luxor the buildings of King Amenophis III. (1566 <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.c</span>.), and northwards<br/>
those of Ramses II. (Sesostris), are pre-eminently to<br/>
be noted. The front side of the wing of the Pylon of<br/>
the temple of Ramses is decorated with a representation<br/>
of the battle of Radosh, on the Orontes, in which<br/>
Ramses obtained a notable victory over the King of<br/>
the Hethites and his allies. Only one of the two obelisks<br/>
(the eastern) has maintained its old position. The enormous dimensions of the colossal sitting statues of this king<br/>
can now only be gathered from the heads which project<br/>
from the ground."<br/>
<br/>
While we were looking at the various monuments the<br/>
greedy Arabs flocked round us from the streets with small<br/>
(but, according to Brugsch Pasha, mostly forged) relics,<br/>
professedly taken from the excavations, and pressed them<br/>
on us in the most annoying way. We had to defend<br/>
ourselves with the utmost vigour against the pushing,<br/>
screaming, violently gesticulating crowd.<br/>
<br/>
In a side street we found a group of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ababdehs</span>. This<br/>
is a very interesting race, not in the least Arab, and of a<br/>
character wholly foreign to the Semitic no less than to the<br/>
negro type..<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">r </span>t <span style="color: #0000FF;">They </span>are held to be descendants of some remote <span style="color: #ff0000;">Asiatic<br/>
