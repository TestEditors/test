<br/>
<br/>
</span>Some Frenchmen, officials of the factory, which is arranged<br/>
entirely on European plans, received us most kindly, placed<br/>
as many labourers at our service as were required to beat<br/>
the sugar-cane thickets, and had a train got ready at once<br/>
for our railway <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>Passing through an avenue <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>sycamores and by<br/>
the factory, in a few minutes we reached the little station of<br/>
the short line of rails which connects the factory with the<br/>
largest plantations<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span>The next thing was to collect the <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters</span>. A troop of<br/>
fellaheen coming from the factory were soon got together,<br/>
and straightway packed into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">waggons </span>used for transporting sugar-cane. We placed ourselves in the last of these,<br/>
and started for the plain, leaving behind us the pretty<br/>
gardens of the officials, and then an exceedingly miserable<br/>
fellaheen village, with a small palm wood.<br/>
<br/>
After a short journey the train stopped. A narrow<br/>
strip of tilled land is all that separates the Nile from the<br/>
desert region, which here comes close up to it.<br/>
<br/>
The nearest field of sugar-cane was to be beaten, but<br/>
unluckily the plantations were too thick and too big. The<br/>
beat was unsuccessful, and only one wolf appeared, which<br/>
escaped from his hiding-place unharmed. We soon recognized the fruitlessness of our endeavours and returned to our<br/>
train. On our way through the little village already mentioned I shot from the waggon a carrion vulture, which was<br/>
sitting with others of its kind beside a clay cottage.<br/>
<br/>
In the garden of one of the French officials we were<br/>
shown several jackal and, as the good people supposed,<br/>
wolf dens. An attempt to get the dachshunds in was<br/>
<br/>
