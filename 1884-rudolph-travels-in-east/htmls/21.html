<br/>
</span>MY Eastern tour had been quickly decided upon, and<br/>
the preparations for it were made with speed. Various<br/>
books of Eastern travel were rapidly looked through, and a<br/>
few days before our start the luggage, a skin-dresser with<br/>
all his apparatus, the servants, guns, plenty of ammunition,<br/>
and several dogs, were sent off to Trieste, where the yacht<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>, which had graciously been placed at our disposal<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>awaited us.<br/>
