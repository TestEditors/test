<br/>
closely survey the stream and its lovely surroundings. On<br/>
both sides there were blooming pastures, leafy shades,<br/>
willow bushes, and a rich undergrowth of flowering plants,<br/>
with a flora recalling, on the whole, that of the water<br/>
meadows of Europe. The river itself has the character of<br/>
a genuine mountain stream, rapid and foaming and splashing<br/>
among the rocks and stones. One might have supposed<br/>
one's self transported to the banks of the Inn or the Traun<br/>
in the midst of our beautiful Alps. While the Bedouins<br/>
slaked their thirst and then placed the wild boar on the<br/>
back of an ass which they had brought with them, we<br/>
rested under the shade of a tree and divested ourselves of<br/>
one garment after another.<br/>
<br/>
The water of the Jordan is very cold as compared with<br/>
the high temperature of the air, and a careful cooling of the<br/>
body before bathing in it is quite indispensable. In half<br/>
an hour we ventured far into the middle of the stream.<br/>
It was not only an unwonted and helpful refreshment, but<br/>
also a real episode of interest in our journey. Here had<br/>
the Israelites, protected by a miracle, crossed the swift<br/>
stream. Here David had returned to his kingdom in a<br/>
boat with Barzillai. Here Elijah had smitten the waves<br/>
with his mantle so that they parted asunder.<br/>
<br/>
In later times the giant Christopher had borne the<br/>
child Jesus through those selfsame waters. And what<br/>
touches the Christian most nearly is the baptism of the<br/>
Saviour Himself by John, who dwelt in this desert, clothed<br/>
in camels' hair and living on locusts and wild honey, and<br/>
whom Jesus of Nazareth came to visit, to be baptized by<br/>
the pious solitary, the forerunner of the new faith. <span style="color: #ff0000;">And<br/>
