<br/>
marked along it from Port Said to Suez suit the character<br/>
of the desert which is traversed by its blue waters. The<br/>
only spot which claims notice is that known by the ancient<br/>
name <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kantara-el-Chazne</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. the, Bridge of Treasures, in<br/>
the north of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Datte </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">] </span>Lake. It marks the passage of<br/>
Egyptian caravans into Asia.<br/>
<br/>
"In the earliest times of Egyptian history a strong fortress stood on this spot lying on both sides of the canal which<br/>
united the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dattel </span>Lake with Lake Menzaleh<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>A bridge<br/>
led from one side to the other, as a picture of the time of<br/>
King Seti I. (father of Ramses <span style="color: #0000FF;">11.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Sesostris) on the outer<br/>
north wall of the great temple of Amon at Karnak distinctly<br/>
shows. At this point began that eastward region to<br/>
which the Egyptians gave the name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hazian.or </span>Hazion.<br/>
The Greeks transformed the name into <span style="color: #ff0000;">Casion</span>, and the<br/>
Romans to Casium, by which they designated the mountainous part of the desert near the ancient Lake Serbonis<br/>
(now only a marsh), which advances as a promontory into<br/>
the Mediterranean. A sacred shrine stood here, dedicated<br/>
to the guardian of the district, Zeus Cassius. The Arabs<br/>
on their part give to this old name of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hasion </span>an inventive<br/>
involution, i.e. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chazne</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'treassure</span>,' which has kept its place<br/>
in the above-mentioned names, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kantara-el-Chazne</span>, or the<br/>
' bridge of treasure.' Lastly, we must observe that the old<br/>
' way of the Philistines,' as it is called in the Scriptures, by<br/>
which the armies of the Pharaohs and of foreign conquerors<br/>
advanced from Kantara to Palestine, lay between the Mediterranean and Lake Serbonis, while in later and recent<br/>
<br/>
times the preference was given to the south of the lake<br/>
for the desert or caravan highway."<br/>
