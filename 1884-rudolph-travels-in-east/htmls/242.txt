<br/>
higher houses, and a bazaar which is worth seeing. The<br/>
other quarters of the town consist of miserable earth huts<br/>
and irregular nooks of all kinds. The eastern side is<br/>
surrounded by a wall, which has fallen down at several<br/>
points; to that adjoins a large tract of Mussulman <span style="color: #ff0000;">buryinggrounds</span>. Our first visit was to the bazaar. A long<br/>
street is closely filled on both sides with stalls and<br/>
covered <span style="color: #ff0000;">oxierhead </span>with boards because of the sun.<br/>
<br/>
The dealers in the shops are Arabs,'in their long<br/>
Oriental dresses, with turbans on their heads. The<br/>
people who move to and fro and bring their goods<br/>
to market, cheated and deceived by the cunning Semite,<br/>
are no Orientals, nor even the fellaheen, who are allied to<br/>
them. The Bedouin, too, is wholly absent. The people<br/>
are of purely African race; many negroes, dark-brown<br/>
Nubians, the successors of the old Ethiopians, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ababdehs</span>,<br/>
and Beshas, and all the various small tribes of Kushite<br/>
origin wander up and down.<br/>
<br/>
We have reached the extreme limit of the East; here<br/>
it only exists and thrives in the form of a commercial<br/>
town, for the transmission of African produce down<br/>
the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
Genuine Eastern products, such as we saw in the Muski<br/>
at Cairo, are not to be found here. The raw produce of<br/>
the tropics lies piled up in the narrow shops.<br/>
<br/>
White and grey ostrich feathers; antlers and skins of<br/>
many kinds of antelopes and gazelles; covers made of<br/>
skins of panthers and other beasts of prey; eggs, the<br/>
fruits of tropical plants, gums, spices, African arms, sticks<br/>
for <span style="color: #ff0000;">cahlel-drivers</span>, primitive ornaments such as the negroes<br/>
<br/>
