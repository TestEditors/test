represent by word and in pictures, campaigns, battles,<br/>
hunting, and even landscapes; many of these Persian<br/>
scenes were not only of historical, but also of artistic<br/>
value.<br/>
<br/>
After we had looked through the library so far as<br/>
our limited time allowed, we continued our drive, and<br/>
passing through the stir of the crowded Arab town and<br/>
hastening along some European streets, we soon came to<br/>
the great square of the vice-regal palace.<br/>
<br/>
Opposite to the palace and the barracks stands a newly<br/>
built college. The present Khedive bestows the utmost<br/>
care on this institution, which he himself founded, and had<br/>
requested us to visit. We went through the class-rooms<br/>
in which the scholars were at work under European<br/>
teachers. They are mostly the sons of rich <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairene<br/>
</span>Moslems, but amongst them were two boys of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Vice..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">roy's-fine</span>, lively, healthy-looking children. We were<br/>
shown the living, eating, and play rooms. The institution<br/>
is entirely arranged on a European plan, but a taste for<br/>
luxury in embroideries and furniture was displayed, which<br/>
is foreign to the purposes <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>school.<br/>
<br/>
We next paid visits to the two Consuls-general, Barons<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">ScMffer </span>and Saurma, in their charming houses, and then<br/>
drove back to the Arab quarter. We stopped at a very<br/>
narrow street, not practicable for carriages, and went on<br/>
foot to the door of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">H6tel </span>du Nil. The situation<br/>
of this excellent hotel, in the middle of the old town, is<br/>
beautiful, and the court, converted into a garden with fine<br/>
plants and shady trees, lends a further charm to the scene.<br/>
The owner is an Austrian, and thus several countrymen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
