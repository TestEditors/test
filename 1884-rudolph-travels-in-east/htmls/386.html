</span>We must now turn from the valuable remarks of the<br/>
most learned of Egyptian historians to the chronicle of our<br/>
own movements.<br/>
<br/>
A French canal steamer took us over the beautiful bluegreen waters of the Red Sea to the Arabian coast. We<br/>
stopped at the nearest point to the Wells of Moses, and<br/>
soon the whole party were merrily trotting across the desert<br/>
on small donkeys. We had trodden Asiatic ground for the<br/>
first time, and we greeted with due solemnity the most<br/>
beautiful of all continents. The Arabian desert differs<br/>
wholly in character from the African. Dazzling white takes<br/>
the place of orange hues, only broken here and there by<br/>
small shrubs.<br/>
<br/>
The Springs of Moses, which we reached in half an<br/>
hour's ride, form a real though very small oasis. A luxuriant<br/>
garden blooms around the springs, which gush forth from<br/>
funnel-shaped holes. Palms and bushes, tall grass and<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">broad-leaved </span>plants, delight the eyes. A few huts serve as<br/>
dwellings for some poor Bedouins.<br/>
<br/>
Besides some swallows, I only saw lizards and extraordinary numbers of the chameleon, thin as a leaf, and<br/>
changing colour at every moment. The tracks of hyaenas,<br/>
wolves, and jackals showed that beasts of prey came there<br/>
at night to drink.<br/>
<br/>
The Bedouins whom we found at the springs were<br/>
in wretched rags. Their primitive flint guns had long<br/>
cords twisted round them, which had to be lighted and<br/>
let burn until they came in contact with the powder in the<br/>
pan. The poor sportsmen must therefore wait for several<br/>
minutes in expectation of the joyous event. We got them<br/>
