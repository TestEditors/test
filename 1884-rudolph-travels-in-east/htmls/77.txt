<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">raiment</span>; half-open shops and coffee-houses, customers<br/>
squatting in front of them; children tumble in the dust;<br/>
every one shouts and hustles; no one steps aside; terrified<br/>
fellaheen women in blue skirts, carrying nurslings or<br/>
waterpots on their heads, escape screaming at the quick<br/>
approach of the carriages. The runners clear the way for<br/>
our equipages with blows from their staves. To the right<br/>
and left I notice neat houses within their own beautiful<br/>
gardens. In a few moments we turn in through a trellised<br/>
gate, where, amidst shrubs and thick plantations, stands the<br/>
Castle of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-en-Nusha</span>. A division of infantry greeted<br/>
us with a blast of horns.<br/>
<br/>
The charming abode which the Viceroy had with the<br/>
greatest kindness offered to us is a castle consisting of two<br/>
square buildings. A gallery with large glazed windows<br/>
over the entrance gate unites the two blocks; without and<br/>
within everything is European, but the variety of the<br/>
decorations, the gay hangings, the Eastern bath-rooms, and<br/>
innumerable small details remind one at every turn that one<br/>
is in the East.<br/>
<br/>
We settled ourselves quickly, and were drinking in with<br/>
delight the first impressions of Oriental life. The arrangement of the apartments, as well as the numerous charming<br/>
terraces, the perfume of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flower </span>garden, and the soft<br/>
delicious air, reminded us of all the glories with which<br/>
Eastern fancy adorns its tales. After a hasty breakfast<br/>
some of our party went out hunting with Baron Saurma.<br/>
<br/>
The town had to be traversed, and so we came once<br/>
more across the canal, and drove through the European<br/>
quarter, with its broad streets and the handsome houses<br/>
