<span>26 TRAVELS IN THE EAST<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

</span>and those of Asia Minor too. Greek priests in plenty and<br/>
some Franciscans represented Christendom.<br/>
<br/>
Arab donkey-drivers, porters, and water-carriers appear<br/>
in the European streets; but the greater number of them<br/>
keep to the Arab quarter. Moors and Nubians stand<br/>
before the houses of the wealthy bankers, where they serve<br/>
rather for show than for any particular use.<br/>
<br/>
We were very soon weary of the straight streets, and<br/>
went back to the Arab quarter. Through some narrow lanes<br/>
built in Eastern style, the houses with bay and grated<br/>
harem windows, we reached the centre of Oriental life.<br/>
The carriages had to go slower and slower till at last we<br/>
were obliged to leave them. We went on foot through the<br/>
bazaar.<br/>
<br/>
Alexandria cannot claim to figure as an Arab town,<br/>
and yet the insignificant little bazaar, with all its life and<br/>
movement, produces an overpowering impression on the<br/>
European, who, coming to it fresh from the West, has never<br/>
before been in contact with Oriental manners.<br/>
<br/>
The crowd of idle on-lookers, of buyers, sellers, loitering<br/>
children and dogs, reckless donkey-drivers, strange dresses,<br/>
and varied types of race were here all represented, but on<br/>
a far smaller scale than in Cairo. I shall therefore confine<br/>
myself to describing as well as I can the Arab quarter and<br/>
the far-famed bazaar of the ancient city of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Caliphs</span>. To<br/>
obtain full knowledge of this most interesting display of<br/>
Eastern life demands special study.<br/>
<br/>
We made our way but slowly and with difficulty through<br/>
the bazaar. At the other end the carriages awaited us,<br/>
and we drove to the Southern station, the arrangements <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
