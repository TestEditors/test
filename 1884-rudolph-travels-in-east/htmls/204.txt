vals. The adytum was separated by a special <span style="color: #0000FF;">passage<br/>
</span>or corridor from the smaller rooms, of which the most<br/>
important was the chamber lying immediately behind<br/>
it. It formed the primal part of every temple, the axis<br/>
of the whole structure passing exactly through its<br/>
centre.<br/>
<br/>
"From the vestibule you ascended terrace-wise to<br/>
each of the succeeding rooms. The plan of the Temple<br/>
of Solomon, with its colonnades, courts, <span style="color: #0000FF;">vestibules</span>, holy<br/>
place (hall of sacrifice), and holiest of holies (with the<br/>
ark of the covenant), corresponds accurately in construction<br/>
to the Egyptian temple architecture."<br/>
<br/>
By torchlight we examined all the rooms of the<br/>
great building, the narrow crypts, stairs, and passages. I<br/>
remained for a long time in the vast dark, pillar-supported<br/>
hall. The colossal, grey, unpainted masses of stone,<br/>
adorned with the richest hieroglyphics, recall the days<br/>
that are past. One can imagine no more vivid memorial<br/>
of ancient times than this temple of Dendera, in its<br/>
mysterious beauty. In spirit one saw the priests of this<br/>
mighty cultus move along in their long white robes, with<br/>
their curled black beards and high caps, bearing sacrifices<br/>
to the all-powerful goddess of the ancient realm of<br/>
the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
In the desolate corridor the bats now dwell in incredible<br/>
numbers, and in the great hall sat an owl, while on the<br/>
cornice a pair of ravens had built their nest. I shot the<br/>
large jet-black female just as she was flying out through<br/>
the door.<br/>
<br/>
From the flat roof of the temple we had a <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful<br/>
