desired that I should leave the ground.<br/>
<br/>
As the tones of his voice and the motions of his hand<br/>
grew more energetic, I called for Osman, the black kavasse<br/>
of Baron Saurma, to come to me. When the worthy<br/>
Oriental saw the livery of the Consul's servant his voice fell<br/>
to the gentle, imploring tones of entreaty, and he hastily<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew </span>in fear of menace, and sought shelter in the thick<br/>

From a high heap of rubbish, one of whose sides forms<br/>
with the ruins of an old wall the last house of the town,<br/>
and where at night hyaenas and jackals howl in company<br/>
with wild dogs, we enjoyed a magnificent view. The sun,<br/>
encircled by misty clouds of the most varied hues, dipped in<br/>
the orange Libyan desert, and as it sank, it bathed in gold<br/>
the Pyramids, the battlements and minarets of the city, the<br/>
citadel, and the steep cliffs of the Mokattam mountains. It<br/>
