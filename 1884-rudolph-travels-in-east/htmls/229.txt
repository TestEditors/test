<span>OUR SAND-BANK STATION. 135<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
soon reached a point where the Nile makes a sharp<br/>
bend, and the mountains on either side draw closer, till at<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Gebeleh </span>they fall abruptly to the river in steep cliffs. The<br/>
picturesquely shaped ravines, rocks, and stony steeps of<br/>
the barren and lofty Gebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nisseh </span>mountain of the Arab<br/>
bank, are particularly fine.<br/>
<br/>
We were on deck, enjoying the beautiful landscape,<br/>
when I espied a dead buffalo on a sand-bank, surrounded<br/>
with vultures.'With the aid of a telescope I discovered<br/>
that beside the white-headed vulture, the great blue-headed<br/>
ear-vulture, a purely African bird, was also there..<br/>
<br/>
Unluckily the timid birds would not let the steamer<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">come-within </span>fair shooting distance of them. We stopped<br/>
at once, and the Grand Duke and I went ashore. Some<br/>
bushes on the bank gave sufficient cover, and, waiting<br/>
quietly, we hoped for the return of the magnificent <span style="color: #ff0000;">earvulture </span>to his interrupted meal.<br/>
<br/>
Nothing came, alas! but a ravenous pair of carrion<br/>
vultures, of which I shot one with my fowling-piece.<br/>
At the sound of the gun several inquisitive fellaheen<br/>
came up (here they are quite dark and almost naked).<br/>
To them we gave a commission to put some carrion daily<br/>
in this spot, and in no way to disturb the birds, in the<br/>
hope that on my return I might try my luck again with<br/>
the ear-vulture. The worthy people promised, in consideration of a good backsheesh, to comply exactly with<br/>
our wishes.<br/>
<br/>
We now rowed back to the steamer and continued our<br/>
voyage without further delay. After we had passed below<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>bare hill crowned with the monument of an old sheik,<br/>
