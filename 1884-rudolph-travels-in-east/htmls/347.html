<span>OUR NIGHT QUARTERS. 217<br/>

many as ten, also passed to and fro, but out of shot; the<br/>
great flocks were not seen till after sundown. The flamingo<br/>
on the wing is a most ridiculous object. Its long neck, and<br/>
its feet, which it carries horizontally, look like a long staff<br/>
to which two wings are hung.<br/>
<br/>
The wind increased in the evening, and the waves beat<br/>
hard on the shore of the island. The clouds broke somewhat, and we enjoyed the sight of a fine sunset. The<br/>
western heaven was a red purple, its hue was reflected by<br/>
the lake, and the sun sank slowly into the tremulous<br/>
waves.<br/>
<br/>
We set out for our vessel as soon as it was quite dark.<br/>
We had first to march knee-deep through the thick bushes<br/>

</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mined </span>the strange picture; the little flotilla beside the<br/>
narrow islet, in the dark night, on the desolate lake, far<br/>
from any human abode, made a most singular impression.<br/>
The perfect stillness was only broken by the monotonous<br/>
splash of the waves and the hoarse voices of the Arabs.<br/>

Conversation soon died out, and Arab and European<br/>
snoring, harmoniously blending, was the only sound. I<br/>
