<span>BREAKFAST AT HOTEL DU NIL. 229<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
addition to our own party and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abd-el-Kader</span>, Brugsch<br/>
Pasha, and Baron Saurma, met in a pretty kiosk for an<br/>
excellent breakfast served in common.<br/>
<br/>
We spent some pleasant hours there, and an Arab<br/>
conjurer amused us by some very clever tricks. His<br/>
assistant, a little boy, called out before each trick in broken<br/>
'German, "Come here, devil." This display was followed<br/>
by a serpent-charmer with very big spectacle-serpents,<br/>
sundry lizards (among them the grey Geko), and uncanny<br/>
scorpions, all of which he brought from under his broad<br/>
cloak. Then came a man with well-trained fat monkeys, a<br/>
goat, and several dogs. These are, as a whole, the same<br/>
familiar performances that are given in every fair in<br/>
Europe, but the brown figure of the conjurer in his ample<br/>
robe, the dignified department of the Oriental, and the<br/>
general effect of the gay scene, lend a special charm to<br/>
things in themselves tedious or childish.<br/>
<br/>
On reaching home we put on our shooting suits, and<br/>
the Grand Duke and I drove, with Baron Saurma, through<br/>
the town and across the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>bridge to the neighbourhood<br/>
of the vice-regal country houses. In a sugar field there<br/>
we stationed ourselves with a bleating kid well hidden<br/>
among the tall canes. Alas! neither wolf nor wild beast<br/>
came. Saurma had often <span style="color: #0000FF;">had'good </span>sport at the same<br/>
place and in the same way, but Diana was to-day again<br/>
unkind, and when it became dark we drove home. It was<br/>
a splendid evening, and on a wonderful sunset followed the<br/>
glory of an African spring night. Insects chirped and<br/>
whirred, bats skimmed round the trees whose tops were<br/>
gently murmuring. An ocean of stars glittered in the<br/>
