the heat of the night considerable, so I laid my booty down<br/>
and waited till the Nubian huntsman should come up.<br/>
<br/>
The wolf had not lain many seconds on the ground<br/>
before it began to move again, and struggled till it got on<br/>
its feet, but another shot put an instantaneous <span style="color: #0000FF;">em</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>to its<br/>
existence.<br/>
<br/>
We went now with our grand spoil, consisting of wolf<br/>
and jackal, back to the ship, where we supped. The<br/>
Grand Duke and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eschenbacher </span>had been in ambush in<br/>
a dome-shaped building on the other side of the buryingground, but unfortunately met with no success.<br/>
<br/>
On the 8th of March we started at seven in the<br/>
morning, most of us mounted on donkeys, for only Hoyos<br/>
and Pausinger wished to try the ride on camels. Riding<br/>
round Assuan, we got by a short cut through the<br/>
graveyard to the desert. Valleys, hills, sand, rocks, and<br/>
ravines followed each other in pleasant alternation.<br/>
<br/>
Adeep ravine led us into the narrow Valley of the Nile<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>shut in by jagged varied hills with blocks of black granite on<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>their sides. At a stroke, as it were, we beheld a splendid<br/>
view<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>dark, frowning masses of rock, the river rushing rapidly<br/>
through the narrows, the green island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phike</span>, with the<br/>
lofty ruins of its temples, and southward, the valley growing<br/>
broad with its tract of rich vegetation along the banks<br/>
of the Nile. All this unrolled itself in a moment before<br/>
our eyes. We were in Nubia. Near the island lies a<br/>
miserable Nubian village of clay huts, called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shelltl</span>.<br/>
Natives more or less clad crept out of their wretched<br/>
dwellings.<br/>
<br/>
We passed along by dark rocks and sad <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores </span>and<br/>
