<br/>
Times have changed and religion has changed its forms.<br/>
But of all the many Eastern rites and creeds, similar<br/>
in nature and alike in their leading ideas, only one has<br/>
maintained its ground, has kept itself pure-the Hebrew,<br/>
the doctrine of the true Jehovah and of His prophet Moses;<br/>
and yet the people, the chosen race, have lost country<br/>
and political existence; the Jew alone is immortal, maintaining his type and his creed incorrupt, though scattered<br/>
over the whole face of the earth.<br/>
<br/>
Unconsciously he avenges himself by his very existence;<br/>
consciously he represents a certain force with which the<br/>
keen intellect of the East has endowed him. The West has<br/>
stripped him of everything, scattered him over the whole<br/>
world, but never been able to exterminate him, and so this<br/>
much-tried people still exists and claims the justice which<br/>
may not be denied to it from the history of the world.<br/>

faiths. Christianity, transferred to the West and to our own<br/>
day, finds the birthplace of its leading ideas ever in the<br/>
East. The ancient Eastern Semitic religions have been<br/>
preserved in their purest and most incorrupt form by<br/>
Islam.<br/>
<br/>
Springing from these Semitic religions, and destined to<br/>
be their continuation among the same races, Islam obtained<br/>
power in those countries, and, spreading from them to other<br/>
and very different peoples, has kept the East stationary by<br/>
