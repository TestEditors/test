<span>356 TRAVELS IN THE EAST<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>The tents stood at the foot of the mountain, on the grass<br/>
of the steppe and the wild prickly oats, but close to the<br/>
more plenteous verdure and to the banks of a little brook.<br/>
We had now almost reached the top of the valley, which<br/>
ends in a picturesque basin hemmed in by steep banks.<br/>
We fell with furious hunger on our luncheon, for it was<br/>
now three p.m., and we had eaten nothing since five a.m.,<br/>
besides exerting ourselves considerably in the interval.<br/>
<br/>
We spent the afternoon in our camp. The life of a<br/>
caravan in the open air and in tents has a great charm, and<br/>
differs considerably from the routine of European existence.<br/>
Unfortunately the camp of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Audje </span>had some special<br/>
inconveniences. The tents stood on the dry and very<br/>
inflammable heath, and a cigarette thrown carelessly away<br/>
occasioned in the space of a few minutes a fire which<br/>
could only be extinguished by most summary measures.<br/>
As we had a large quantity of ammunition with us,<br/>
double care had to be taken, and there was nothing for<br/>
it but greatly to limit our smoking. Furthermore, the<br/>
brook, so indispensable to the caravan, dried up shortly<br/>
after our arrival<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Inquiry was made, and it was discovered<br/>
to have been blocked and diverted from its channel. It<br/>
was evening before it could be brought back into its old<br/>
course and could give relief to the thirsting mules and<br/>
horses.<br/>
<br/>
The Pashas had reason to suspect that the Bedouin<br/>
chief who had been dismissed the day before and driven<br/>
from our caravan was the contriver of this piece of mischief.<br/>
<br/>
In the evening several of the gentlemen went out to<br/>
take a short stroll with their guns. I succeeded in <span style="color: #0000FF;">killing<br/>
