<br/>
</span>In front of one of these innumerable clefts the dogs<br/>
gave tongue, and disappeared, searching among the stones.<br/>
In a few seconds a lynx appeared, leaving his hiding-place<br/>
with great bounds. I stood on a projecting rock below<br/>
which he must turn. At my first shot he broke down, but<br/>
recovered, and it took a second charge of shot to finish<br/>
him. He was a very powerful beast of grey colour, with<br/>
tufts of hair on his ears-the true African desert, lynx,<br/>
larger and stronger than his European relative.<br/>
<br/>
The Grand Duke had meanwhile searched the opposite<br/>
slope of the mountain with dogs. Twice lynx had been<br/>
seen by him, but for such a brief moment that there was no<br/>
chance of a shot. We met at the appointed spot, and now<br/>
drove together with all the dachshunds. The merry tongue<br/>
of the dogs was soon heard, and we hastened forward; but<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">unluckily </span>my uncle, whose turn it was to fire, <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>not<br/>
followed fast enough over the rocks, and the lynx left his<br/>
cover unhurt and disappeared quickly among the stones..<br/>
The dogs strove as quickly as their short legs and the<br/>
sloping rocks would allow to follow his track. <span style="color: #0000FF;">In </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>few<br/>
minutes they stood at bay in front of the funnel<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>of a<br/>
burrow which led under a great rock. On the opposite<br/>
side of the rock was the wider entrance of this cover.<br/>
With but little urging several of the dogs pushed into<br/>
the dark hole. The lynx appeared to be caught in a <span style="color: #ff0000;">mlde-sac</span>, for a fierce fight began. The plaintive tones of the<br/>
beaten dogs, and the fresh voices of those who were<br/>
fighting bravely, mingled with the savage growls of the<br/>
lynx.<br/>
<br/>
We stood for nearly an hour beside the den, and the<br/>
