<span>192 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We breakfasted in the small house near the Apis tombs<br/>
which had been built for purposes of study by the famous<br/>
Egyptologist, Mariette, lately deceased; and then went to<br/>
the curious low-terraced Pyramid to hunt jackals. The<br/>
Arabs had scarcely begun to climb the stones when down<br/>
came a jackal in full flight and was shot by me. After this<br/>
little sporting interlude we visited the other Pyramids in<br/>
the neighbourhood, and the small recently opened one of<br/>
King Pepi I.<br/>
<br/>
Permit me here to quote <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">notes </span>about Pyramids in<br/>
general, those of Memphis and Ghizeh, and also about the<br/>
Sphinx, for which I am indebted to my friend <span style="color: #ff0000;">Brugsch</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>The old national god of Memphis, Ptah, in his special<br/>
capacity of king of the dead and protector of the departed,<br/>
bore the name of Sokar. In this capacity he was absolutely identical with the god Osiris of the whole country.<br/>
A sanctuary dedicated to him on the site of the present<br/>
village of Sakkara bore the old Egyptian designation<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">'house </span>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sokar</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>from which the Arabic name of the<br/>
village Sakkara is directly derived. The graves of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Memphites</span>, which are grouped round the Pyramids in<br/>
regular order, and the oldest of which belong to the<br/>
period of the Memphite kings, were under the protection<br/>
of this king of the dead. A whole city of the dead arose<br/>
on the soil of the desert. Long rows of funeral chapels<br/>
built in stone, the so-called'houses of eternity,' formed<br/>
by their continuity the streets of the city. Underneath<br/>
them, in deep shafts, were the actual chambers in which the<br/>
departed rested in their wooden or stone <span style="color: #0000FF;">coffins </span>The <span style="color: #ff0000;">bestpreserved </span>mausoleum of the times of the Memphite kings<br/>
