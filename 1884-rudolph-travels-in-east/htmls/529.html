<br/>
</span>garden land of the well region of Sultan-Ain was passed,<br/>
and the steppe again received us.<br/>
<br/>
The ground was good for riding on the whole, and one<br/>
could almost always gallop; only here and there stony<br/>
places and water-courses in the proximity of the mountains<br/>
had to be passed. After a two hours' ride <span style="color: #ff0000;">antolerably </span>broad<br/>
mountain valley opened on our left. In its interior, at its<br/>
farther end, is the spring of <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Audje</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>fountain which<br/>
both <span style="color: #0000FF;">fertilize</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>the land and maintains it in fertility. It<br/>
flows through the valley, and thence across the plain to the<br/>
Jordan. Low trees and shrubs had again to be crossed,<br/>
and at the other side of this narrow band of vegetation<br/>
Salim was awaiting us with his people, eager for the<br/>
chase and ready to lead us to ground richly stocked<br/>
with game.<br/>
<br/>
The great caravan and most of the gentlemen turned to<br/>
the left into the side valley to the fountain of El-Audie;<br/>
the Grand Duke, Hoyos, and I followed the Bedouins. An.<br/>
amazing number of birds of prey were on the trees here,<br/>
and in the space of a few minutes I shot a "Jean le <span style="color: #0000FF;">blanc </span>"<br/>
eagle and a booted eagle, and Hoyos a booted eagle also.<br/>
There were stretches of wild oats between the shrubs that<br/>
swarmed with quail, which rose at every step, and had we<br/>
possessed sufficient ammunition our success would have<br/>
been brilliant with those birds. The red-legged partridge<br/>
was but sparingly represented, and the rock partridge was<br/>
wholly absent. A long stretch due east led us far into the<br/>
interior of the plain of the Jordan. Once more returning to<br/>
the edge of the steppe, we rested in the shade ofa tree for<br/>
half an hour, then remounted our horses and, followed<br/>
