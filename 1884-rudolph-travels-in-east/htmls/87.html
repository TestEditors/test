preserved in the mosque, and a great festival celebrated<br/>
in his honour each year, during fourteen days of the month<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Rabiet-Tani</span>, the fourth of the Mohammedan year.<br/>
<br/>
We drew on slippers, and a kindly dervish conducted<br/>
us into the building, the interior of which is of handsome<br/>
architecture and richly decorated.<br/>
<br/>
Several people, by their dress wealthy Orientals, were<br/>
seated in a circle on rich carpets, and read in low tones<br/>
out of ancient books the wise maxims of the Koran. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Meanwhile</span>, a specially learned man squatted in the midst of the<br/>
faithful, and explained the most important passages. Other<br/>
worshippers knelt or lay <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat </span>on the ground, and went<br/>
through their prayers with faces turned towards Mecca.<br/>
<br/>
Here, as elsewhere in mosques, a point, gaily adorned<br/>
with green velvet and gilding, marked the direction of the<br/>
Mohammedans' holiest spot on earth. Great chandeliers<br/>
hung from the cupola, and the genuine Oriental <span style="color: #0000FF;">arrange</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span>ments of the temple, no less than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">demeanour </span>of the<br/>
faithful, claimed the full attention of the strangers,<br/>
<br/>
In an adjacent court, of fine architecture, is the basin<br/>
for the holy ablutions. The look of this bath, with its<br/>
border of flat stones, gives the idea of exquisite cleanliness.<br/>
On further inquiry, one realizes how disgusting is the<br/>
practice which the Koran imposes on its votaries. Before<br/>
a Mohammedan may enter the holiest part of a mosque,<br/>
he must undergo a certain minutely prescribed purification.<br/>
In a squatting posture, to the accompaniment of murmured<br/>
prayers, the washing begins. Propriety forbids that I<br/>
should describe its further course. When all is done the<br/>
pious man <span style="color: #0000FF;">prayerfully </span>enters the house of God.<br/>
