<br/>
THE morning of the 28th of March found us on the<br/>
open sea. "Land not in sight yet?" was the often<br/>
repeated question, while we waited impatiently for the<br/>
outlines of Asia to rise out of the waters. At length,<br/>
in the forenoon, the dim forms of the mountains of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Judzea<br/>
</span>were seen veiled in blue mist, and soon followed by the<br/>
yellow sands and the terraced fortress-like hill on which<br/>
the town of Jaffa stands.<br/>
<br/>
The country seems bare and desolate at first view.<br/>
Yellow dunes and grey mountains do not please the eye.<br/>
When, however, the vessel neared the town, hoar with<br/>
an historic past, one saw the lovely green circlet of wood<br/>
and garden in the centre of which Jaffa lies. As there<br/>
is no harbour for larger vessels we were obliged to cast<br/>
anchor at some distance outside the fringe of rocks<br/>
which surrounds the town.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after the governor came on board with his<br/>
secretary and the general of division, General Adjutant<br/>
Rizah-Pasha, whom the Sultan had been so good as to<br/>
send expressly from Constantinople, and to assign to <span style="color: #0000FF;">us<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
