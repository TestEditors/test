</span>distant view of the Nile and the green cultivated land<br/>
on the one side, and on the other of the vast desert and<br/>
the towering mountains beyond. It was a solemn picture-the grey ruins, the desolate desert, the lonely mountains<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>nothing green, not even a ray of sunlight to gladden<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">eye.. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">t<br/>
</span>The brightness of the sky and the glory of colouring<br/>
were absent on that afternoon. Everything lay in grey<br/>
shadows, and the sky was darkened, not with clouds-.<br/>
for these are unknown in Upper Egypt-but with heavy<br/>
exhalations and masses of dust, which, combined with the<br/>
oppressive languor of the air, are the first indications<br/>
of the approaching <span style="color: #ff0000;">champsin</span>, the dreaded storm of the<br/>
desert.<br/>
<br/>
We returned in the evening to our ship, hunting as we<br/>
went along, and passed the night on board at the same<br/>
station. Early in the morning the steamer proceeded.<br/>
A heavy <span style="color: #ff0000;">champsin </span>storm was raging in the valley,"<br/>
the sand-clouds of the Sahara shrouding the mountains<br/>
like mist.<br/>
<br/>
The sun <span style="color: #ff0000;">apheared </span>as a red disc-its beams were<br/>
unable to pierce the floods of dust. Everything was<br/>
covered with sand, which penetrated even into the closed<br/>
cabins of our steamer, and was a horrible nuisance.<br/>
A depressing heavy air pervaded the otherwise so beautiful<br/>
scene, and we contemplated with astonishment this, for us,<br/>
novel aspect of nature.<br/>
<br/>
Pelicans, sundry water-fowl, and some cumbrous <span style="color: #ff0000;">watereagles </span>were fired at vainly from a great distance. We<br/>
passed some towns, among them those of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kuft </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>Kus.<br/>
<br/>
