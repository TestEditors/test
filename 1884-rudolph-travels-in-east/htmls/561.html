<br/>
ravines covered with stones and oak woods and extending<br/>
to the mountains. To the west an undulating but <span style="color: #0000FF;">unlovely<br/>
</span>country reaches to the lofty, isolated, mountain mass of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Djebel-Mar-Elias</span>, or Mount Carmel.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed this beautiful scene in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">evening </span>hours.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Some </span>golden eagles and king vultures were circling above<br/>
the quiet, richly wooded valleys. Perfect stillness reigned<br/>
around; only the clear bell of the little convent <span style="color: #0000FF;">waited </span>the<br/>
Ave Maria to the lonely spot. I began to feel equal to<br/>
crawling slowly round the top of the mountain to look at<br/>
the interesting buildings and ruins. A Greek convent<br/>
stands opposite the Latin one in whose court our tent was<br/>
pitched; between these two buildings and around them<br/>
lie the half-ruined walls, stones, and remains of an ancient<br/>
fortification, now overgrown with plants. A pointed and<br/>
well-preserved gateway arrested my attention. Beside it<br/>
were ruins of all dates and descriptions, as the remains<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>castle from the Middle Ages of Arabia show.<br/>
<br/>
In the Old Testament Mount Tabor figures as the boundary between the tribe of Issachar and that of Zebulon.<br/>
Deborah assembled an army here, and from hence the<br/>
Hebrews descended into the plain and slew Sisera, the<br/>
captain of King Jabin of Hazor. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Under</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Antiochus </span>the<br/>
Great, a town called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Itabyrion </span>stood on the summit of the<br/>
mountain. In the year 53 after the birth of Christ a<br/>
battle with the Jews was fought here by <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gambinius</span>.<br/>
Josephus had Mount Tabor fortified subsequently, and<br/>
under Vespasian numerous Israelites were slaughtered<br/>
here by his general Placidus.<br/>
<br/>
This mountain has always been held, since the earliest<br/>
