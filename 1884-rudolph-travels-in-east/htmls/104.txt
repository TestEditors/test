<span>52 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
antiquity have sunk to the level of a Rigi, and the insignificant names of the Western tourist desecrate the<br/>
venerable stones.<br/>
<br/>
We viewed the Cheops, Chefren, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Menkera </span>Pyramids, and also the Sphinx with its body half buried by the<br/>
sands of the desert, and then some Arabs were set to<br/>
climb the second pyramid, to dislodge the jackals which<br/>
house there. Unfortunately we were badly placed, and<br/>
so two jackals escaped unharmed and <span style="color: #ff0000;">betook </span>themselves<br/>
to the boundless desert, intersected by <span style="color: #0000FF;">vales </span>and hills.<br/>
Several shots were fired from below at the beasts as they<br/>
came down, hopping with extraordinary agility among<br/>
the stones, but none took effect, as the distance was too<br/>
great.<br/>
<br/>
The Pyramids gave me, especially when men or animals<br/>
were climbing upon them, the impression of being great<br/>
artificially constructed mountains rather than architectural<br/>
monuments.<br/>
<br/>
The sun went down and the landscape floated in a sea<br/>
of the most glorious light, the grey stones of the Pyramids<br/>
glowed like gold, and the Valley of the Nile, the mass of<br/>
houses of Cairo, the citadel, and the towering <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mokattam<br/>
</span>mountains beyond were dyed in crimson hues. We had to<br/>
hasten home, and drove quickly back by the road by which<br/>
we had come.<br/>
<br/>
In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Schubra </span>Avenue-the Prater of Cairo-we found<br/>
plenty of stir. Riders capered on beautiful Arab horses,<br/>
and there were two closely serried rows of carriages driving<br/>
up and down; it was a Corso lively and gay, such as only<br/>
the South can show, and all unlike our northern caricature<br/>
