<span>318 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

of the custode of Terra Santa and his Franciscans on the<br/>
square outside the church. A great crowd had assembled;<br/>
the beautiful women of Bethlehem scanned us curiously,<br/>
and, covered once more with a shower of petitions, we left<br/>
the sacred birthplace of Christ. The last town and the<br/>
last dwellers on cultivated ground were left behind, and we<br/>
were now for some time to be denizens of the territory of<br/>
free nomads, the true Bedouins.<br/>
<br/>
On leaving Bethlehem we had to ride past our recent<br/>
camp, but we soon struck into a narrow valley shut in by<br/>
grey-green hills, and Bethlehem, Tantur, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mar-Elyits</span>, the<br/>
stony mountains, the plateaus, and their cultivated slopes<br/>
disappeared from our sight<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
<br/>
</span>The Mediterranean type, the Asiatic character of the<br/>
steppe, the monotonous hills covered with short grass, the<br/>
winding valleys, excluding all distant views, now met us.<br/>
The road was good at first, and we could sometimes even<br/>
ride in quick time across the meadows; but the further we<br/>
went the steeper grew the hills and the narrower the<br/>
footway, which at last kept entirely along the steep slopes,<br/>
as the bottom of the valley became a rocky ravine. A<br/>
Bedouin, on an ill-dressed but very graceful bay, rode in<br/>
front. He was sheik of one of these mountain tribes.<br/>
His dress, a wide, dark cloak thrown over light trousers,<br/>
and his plain sword and yellow slippers bore some trace of<br/>
poverty.<br/>
<br/>
The ride in the narrow valley did not afford much<br/>
variety. Here and there very bad pieces of road called for<br/>
caution, and we often had reason to admire the skill with<br/>
which the Arab horses trod on slippery grass or smooth<br/>
