<span>no TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

<br/>
The famous evening lights at Cairo are dim compared<br/>
to those which the sun sheds in Upper Egypt. The nearness of the tropic of Cancer, the boundary of the tropics,<br/>
makes itself felt in everything and by everybody. We<br/>
came to at the landing-stage of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Girgeh</span>, below the high<br/>
and dusty bank, to remain for the night.<br/>
<br/>
After dinner, in pursuance of an invitation from our<br/>
consular agent, a wealthy Copt, we landed, climbing the<br/>
steep bank by a ladder. A motley crowd of inquisitive<br/>
Orientals surrounded us.<br/>
<br/>
Passing through a narrow street, consisting of the usual<br/>
Egyptian brown clay houses, adorned with Arab decorations, and a very poor bazaar, we soon reached the agent's<br/>
residence.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">U </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">p </span>a steep narrow staircase we found the half-European<br/>
and half-Eastern rooms. The perfume of attar of roses,<br/>
Turkish divans, no chairs, coffee, scented cigarettes, bare<br/>
walls, and the most extraordinary medley of rich Eastern<br/>
stuffs-Oriental articles, combined with the most tasteless<br/>
efforts to seem European-are characteristic of the fittings<br/>
of the apartments of wealthy Easterns.<br/>
<br/>
We had scarcely seated ourselves <span style="color: #ff0000;">and'begun </span>to smoke,<br/>
when a band of musicians appeared. The performers were<br/>
four old worn-out looking Arabs, with big turbans and<br/>
ample blue robes. The instruments were very primitive<br/>
--<span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>wooden fife, a tin tamtam, a drum-like looking article,<br/>
and a fiddle resembling our <span style="color: #ff0000;">south-Sclavonic </span>"gusla"<br/>
<br/>
In every land where Islam has ever ruled you find<br/>
these ridiculous musical instruments, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">monotonous<br/>
</span>rhythm, the peculiar nasal twang, the general<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and at <span style="color: #0000FF;">times<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
