fruit. The great difference of climate between the coast of<br/>
Palestine and Egypt was very apparent.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of February we saw the orange harvest in<br/>
Cairo; at the end of March it had not yet begun in Jaffa.<br/>
The scented gardens soon disappeared, and we came to a<br/>
monotonous grey-green plain-nothing but ill-tilled fields,<br/>
an occasional draw-well, a few palms, stony places, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">disorderly </span>Mohammedan burying-place, and in the far distance,<br/>
to close the barren scene, the blue tops of the mountains<br/>

Brightly clad peasants watching herds of camels and<br/>
goats, and beggars of the worst description, were the only<br/>

in the fields, but there was little other animal life.<br/>
<br/>
We soon came to some small miserable-looking villages.<br/>
The road led past graveyards and watch-towers for Turkish<br/>
gendarmerie, and in three hours we reached the ruinous<br/>
and notoriously dirty little town of Ramleh. Our caravan<br/>
only skirted it, though Ramleh is usually the first station<br/>
for pilgrims to Jerusalem. We had no wish to encamp<br/>
near it, and resolved to press on to the village of Latrun,<br/>
which lies at the foot of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
So far as I could see, the inhabitants of Ramleh<br/>
appeared to be interesting in their bright old Hebrew<br/>
