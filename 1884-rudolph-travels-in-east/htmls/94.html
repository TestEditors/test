<span>46 TRAVELS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After a short stay we left the hot rooms, from which<br/>
the horrible smell and the multitude of flies soon bid the<br/>
Western stranger to retreat.<br/>
<br/>
Our course next lay past three mosques, remarkable for<br/>
their bright colours and slender lofty minarets. The first is<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gama </span>Sultan <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kalatin </span>of the year <span style="color: #0000FF;">1287</span>. The second,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Géima </span>Mohammed-en-Nur, dates from the thirteenth<br/>
century, and the third, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gama </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Barkukiye</span>, from the fourteenth. These buildings afford little interest beyond their<br/>
historical associations.<br/>
<br/>
The more remarkable, by comparison, was the old<br/>
triumphal gate, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bhb-en-Nasr</span>, flanked by square towers.<br/>
Its venerable grey stones recall the days of the Arab middle<br/>
ages.<br/>
<br/>
Passing through the gate we followed a path which led<br/>
us past an ancient Mohammedan burying-ground, amongst<br/>
heaps of wreck and ruin, along the dark wall of the city to<br/>
its well-known gate, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bhb-el-Futtlh</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Both the above-mentioned gates-the one signifying victory, and the other<br/>
conquest-spring from the same time, and were built under<br/>
the rule of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fétimee </span>Caliph Mustansir. We now<br/>
turned back into the more lively part of the Arab quarter,<br/>
to give our full and undivided attention to the manifold<br/>
activities of the interior of the bazaar.<br/>
<br/>
To describe the bazaars of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Caiiro</span>, and to depict aright<br/>
its colours, is one of those difficult tasks which only a professed author on his travels could undertake. I shall content myself with noting a few of the most characteristic<br/>
points of the brilliantly coloured picture<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The old Arab town is traversed by a street <span style="color: #ff0000;">called<br/>
