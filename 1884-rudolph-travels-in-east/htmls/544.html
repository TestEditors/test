the more so as Herr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rath </span>on his descent to the Jordan<br/>
met, as he says, in one of these ravines with a small stag<br/>
adorned with short horns.<br/>
<br/>
The second part of the wood consisted also of a leafy<br/>
grove of almost tropical character, with a nearly impenetrable undergrowth. The numerous tracks impelled me to<br/>
try a beat for good luck. I placed the gentlemen in the<br/>
clearing at the most trodden tracks, and made the Turkish<br/>
gendarmes and some of the servants beat the wood, under<br/>
the direction of my huntsman. The undergrowth was so<br/>
thick that it was out of the question to attempt a regular<br/>
chain of <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters</span>, and we very soon perceived that all<br/>
endeavours to drive an animal out of the thicket would be<br/>
labour in vain. I noticed in this copse a pair of <span style="color: #0000FF;">plovers<br/>
</span>and some kites.<br/>
<br/>
We now hastened back to our horses, had them saddled,<br/>
and rode<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>back to the edge of the plateau. We had noticed<br/>
from below peculiar dark mists beating up into the sky,<br/>
but had not been able to account for the appearance.<br/>
When we got to the top we had a very remarkable sight.<br/>
The entire steppe, from the Jordan to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">foot </span>of the<br/>
eastern border hills, was wrapped in a cloud of smoke, out<br/>
of whose murky blackness bright flames burst forth here<br/>
and there; the country across which we had ridden in the<br/>
morning was now a sea of smoke and flame. The grass<br/>
of the steppe burns with incredible rapidity, and we could<br/>
gauge from minute to minute the advance of the fire by<br/>
the approach of the column of smoke which seemed to<br/>
pursue us.<br/>
