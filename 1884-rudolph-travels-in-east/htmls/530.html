by the Bedouins running on foot, rode along the grassy<br/>
yellowing plain.<br/>
<br/>
In about half an hour we came to the edge of a deep<br/>
cut in the elevated plateau; far below a brook was rippling<br/>
between high banks of brown earth. This vision of landscape appearing so suddenly had a startling effect. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Leaving </span>our horses, we had to scramble down the steep bank.<br/>
We hastened forward through the narrow defile by the<br/>
brook, whose salt waters disappointed us, till we reached a<br/>
small ravine surrounded by almost vertical clay walls some<br/>
hundreds of feet in height. Its interior was filled with<br/>
patches of marshy grass, some low bushes, and a reed<br/>
morass. The only outlet was a narrow track up the east<br/>
side of the cliff to the summit of the ridge.<br/>

big boar left the thick cover, took the only way of escape<br/>
by the track up the mountain, and climbed it with the agility<br/>
of a Chamois. Several shots sent from a distance of four<br/>
hundred paces took no effect. I now ran quickly to the<br/>
vicinity of this narrow passage. I was still at the<br/>
distance of at least two hundred paces, when yet another<br/>
large wild boar took the same narrow way. I <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched<br/>
</span>two shots at his hide, neither of them necessarily fatal.<br/>
Badly wounded, and halting with the hind leg, he dragged<br/>
himself slowly over the ridge of the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
Thereupon the beaters came up round me, and I bade<br/>
them follow me cautiously at a certain distance, for I wished<br/>
myself to pursue the red track. To begin, I found <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
