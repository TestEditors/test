<span>MOUNT <span style="color: #0000FF;">SKOPO</span>. 15<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The view in the distance was very fine, but we could<br/>
not long enjoy it, for the hurricane at sea brought us chilly<br/>
and abundant scuds of rain. The priest invited us into<br/>
his house for a draught of wine. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">reverend-looking<br/>
</span>man, with his long beard and flowing hair, gave us, in the<br/>
most friendly manner, some very bad cheese made of<br/>
sheep's milk, bread, and some of the very good wine of the<br/>
country; but withal of such fiery quality as to recall the<br/>
common Spanish draught wines. The room in which we<br/>
were entertained was exactly like a little Spanish fonda.<br/>
A tiled floor covered with tattered matting, broken chairs,<br/>
bare walls, and damp heavy air. A blackened Virgin on<br/>
the wall vouched for the Greek <span style="color: #0000FF;">nationality</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>After our simple meal, we took leave of the hospitable<br/>
priest, and descended the mountain. We passed some<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">fine </span>groups of palms, and, amongst thick shrubs, flowers,<br/>
and bubbling springs, there were spots such as one<br/>
imagines in reading Greek mythology, <span style="color: #0000FF;">fit </span>for the sports of.<br/>
the merry gods.<br/>
<br/>
Again we crossed through gardens to make our way to<br/>
the coast, which soon led us home. The afternoon and<br/>
evening were spent on board.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Unfavourable </span>reports of the weather compelled us to<br/>
pass another day in Zante. A new excursion was therefore planned. We started early on the morning of the<br/>
15th, to make for the northern point of the island.<br/>
<br/>
In the same carriages as on the preceding day, we<br/>
drove, first through streets and then along a well-laid<br/>
country road, which led us through garden lands. On our<br/>
right lay the verdant range of hills; on our left the lofty,<br/>
