Egyptian Zeus, in the neighbourhood of a lake which still<br/>
exists.<br/>
<br/>
"The statues of the Egyptian Juno, all of black granite,<br/>
furnished with the lion's head, and representing the goddess<br/>
in the sitting posture of a queen, were placed around the<br/>
consecrated fountain, and even now <span style="color: #0000FF;">he </span>scattered about,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">some </span>of them in their old places. The best preserved of<br/>
them have been transferred, many years since, to the<br/>
various museums of Europe<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span>"<br/>
<br/>
After we had rambled through the vast halls and the<br/>
forest of ruins and pillars, we returned by the same road to<br/>
Luxor. In the middle of the town, literally wedged in<br/>
between the monuments of antiquity, stands the house of<br/>
the English consular agent-an elderly, well-to-do Arab.<br/>
The wily old fellow, in half-European costume, received us in the most friendly manner, and offered for sale<br/>
Egyptian antiquities at exorbitant prices.<br/>
<br/>
We purchased some pretty pieces, drank the inevitable.<br/>
ceremonial cup of coffee, and then continued our inspection<br/>

"Thebes was from the middle of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-fifth<br/>
</span>century B.C., for full seventeen hundred years, the brilliant<br/>
capital of the Egyptian Empire, its fame being deemed<br/>
worthy even of the song of Homer. The town was<br/>
divided by the Nile into two quarters, as stated in<br/>
numerous inscriptions, and in accordance with the still<br/>
extant remains of old buildings. The two quarters together were covered by the name of Uas or Pi <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amon-the </span>city of Amon, the Diospolis of the Greeks. The part<br/>
