<span>328 <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRAVELS </span>IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We agreed to disperse for the morning hours in different<br/>
directions. The Grand Duke and I ascended one of the<br/>
highest of the hills which enclose the valley, in order again<br/>
to place our kid on the summit; the other gentlemen<br/>
went pigeon shooting in the ravine of Mar-Saba.<br/>
<br/>
We had a long and tiresome climb. The slope was<br/>
steep and slippery; red flint rocks had to be scrambled over<br/>
and the heat was already to be felt. On reaching the top<br/>
we found an excellent ambush, which my huntsman had<br/>
erected the previous afternoon. We sat watching for two<br/>
hours, tormented by insects, but except a carrion vulture,<br/>
which we would not shoot, nothing came. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of<br/>
the birds of prey began again, but, as before, they kept the<br/>
direct line to Jerusalem. No lure could tempt them from<br/>
their course.<br/>
<br/>
We scrambled down, having gained nothing, and took<br/>
the shortest way to the camp, which had meanwhile been<br/>
broken up, and was already for the most part in motion.<br/>
Only a part of the kitchen remained, in which we made<br/>
a slender breakfast to strengthen us for the rest of our<br/>
journey.<br/>
<br/>
The gentlemen had shot a number of pigeons, falcons,<br/>
and sundry other small birds in the ravine.<br/>
<br/>
After our frugal breakfast we took leave of Count<br/>
Caboga, to whom we were under many obligations. He<br/>
had to return to Tantur that day, but lent me for the whole<br/>
of the rest of the journey his servant Ferdinand, and the<br/>
good horse, a beautiful Arab, which he had bought from<br/>
a tribe of Bedouins, and which I had ridden daily since<br/>
our arrival at Jerusalem. I was extremely grateful to the<br/>
<br/>
