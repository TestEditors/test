<br/>
came. I found their like in all the tribes with which I had<br/>
the opportunity of becoming acquainted, both in Africa and<br/>
Asia.<br/>
<br/>
Even the agricultural labourers about <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abuskar </span>struck<br/>
me as being of a different type to the fellaheen who inhabit<br/>
the valley of the Lower Nile. They were bigger and<br/>
darker, more like the Bedouins, who, here in the oases<br/>
enclosed by the desert, are often brought into contact with<br/>
them; obviously a mixed race. And no less notable are<br/>
the numerous Moors amongst them.<br/>
<br/>
No sooner was our caravan got together than sport<br/>
began. In the garden, by the factory, we found the bluefaced bee-eater, a green bird, with a long blue stripe<br/>
on pinion and head. A flight of them was fired at with<br/>
success.<br/>
<br/>
These birds belong to the interior of Africa, but they<br/>
are common in Upper Egypt. They never get so far as<br/>
Cairo, which seems too northerly for them. Large peewits<br/>
were about the field, a charming and genuinely Egyptian<br/>
bird, and troops of herons. Here, as elsewhere in Africa,<br/>
an amazing wealth of animal life is gathered into the strips<br/>
of moist and luxuriant country. The first aspect of things<br/>
promised us good hunting days.<br/>
<br/>
The crack of our shots was soon heard, and much<br/>
feathered spoil was brought in by our Arabs from the wet<br/>
fields. Sportsmen seldom come so far as this neighbourhood, and so we had the pleasure of instructing a most<br/>
unwary foe in the wiles of Europeans.<br/>
<br/>
The caravan went on its way with horses, servants, and<br/>
baggage, but all the gentlemen were dispersed at <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/>
