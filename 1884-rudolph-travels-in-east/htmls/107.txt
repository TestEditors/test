</span>of shivering drosky-drivers on chill May evenings. There<br/>
were handsome carriages of European build, but the servants<br/>
all wore the fez.<br/>
<br/>
Rich Mohammedans, Pashas, Levantines, well-to-do<br/>
Greeks, and the rest of the European world, breathed the<br/>
cool evening air in their carriages. We were most interested by the closed barouches driven by Eastern coachmen. Behind them sat, instead of footmen, black eunuchs,<br/>
with their repulsive heavy features, in half-European dress.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the carriages were the wives of high officials,<br/>
of the different Pashas, and even some princesses. They all<br/>
wore the white Eastern dress, and through their white veils<br/>
bright black eyes might be discerned, delicate features, <span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">formed </span>dark eyebrows, and long eyelashes. Poorer folks<br/>
disported themselves in droskies and on donkeys; and a<br/>
fairly well got up <span style="color: #0000FF;">demi-maude</span>, some Parisian, and even<br/>
more in the style of Vienna and Pesth, made the place<br/>
perilous.<br/>
<br/>
On reaching home we dressed quickly and drove to the<br/>
Palace of the Khedive, where a great dinner was given,<br/>
to which the Ministers and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Consuls-General </span>were<br/>
invited. We were introduced there to the Khedive's<br/>
brothers. The household of the Viceroy is kept on a<br/>
European scale, and the servants, with the exception of<br/>
those who served the coffee and chibouks, are Western.<br/>
<br/>
After dinner we drove with the Viceroy to the large<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekiyé </span>Gardens, lying within the city, where the <span style="color: #ff0000;">AustroHungarian </span>colony had prepared an Arab <span style="color: #ff0000;">féte </span>in our<br/>
honour. Lamps. hung from trees and shrubs. Fireworks<br/>
were let off, and within the tents singers and dancers<br/>
