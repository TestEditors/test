<span>THE PYRAMIDS OF <span style="color: #0000FF;">GHIZEH</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">51<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>adorned with Eastern decorations, are charming in their<br/>
mixture of East and West; the blooming gardens with<br/>
odorous flowers and shrubs and waving palms, enchanted<br/>
me. With amazement I saw in the midst of a town quantities of birds of <span style="color: #0000FF;">prey</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">thousands </span>of kites flying or sitting<br/>
on the roofs, and carrion vultures which swooped down in<br/>
the streets. I heard the song of birds, the moaning of the<br/>
palm doves, and drank in with delight the balmy air of<br/>
heavenly Egypt, thinking of the hardships of the European<br/>
winter which I for once had escaped.<br/>
<br/>
At the extensive buildings of Kasr-en-Nil we crossed<br/>
the holy river and the island of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Geziret-BWk</span>, drove past<br/>
some vice-regal villas and splendid gardens, and soon<br/>
reached the dyke on which the high-road, fenced in by<br/>
trees, leads straight through the cultivated land, between<br/>
fields and the still half-flooded meadows, past a wretched<br/>
Arab village to the edge of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
The carriage drove some hundred paces on the yellow<br/>
sand of the Libyan desert, and stopped at the base of<br/>
the gigantic structures which have looked down for<br/>
thousands of years on the history of the world. A peculiar<br/>
awe overcomes each traveller who gazes for the first time<br/>
in near proximity on these monuments of a long bygone<br/>
age, and can touch with his hands the stones which centuries before the days of Abraham were piled on this spot,<br/>
where they now stand, by the labour and the skill of man.<br/>
<br/>
To describe the Pyramids of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghiz√©h </span>would be to<br/>
repeat a task already done over and over again. They<br/>
belong to the domain of guide-books and the most beaten<br/>
tracks of travellers. The tombs of dynasties of <span style="color: #0000FF;">boat<br/>
<br/>
