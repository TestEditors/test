<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
moister spots were richly peopled by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rocks </span>of grey heron,<br/>
while on the high pines which adorn an artificially made<br/>
hill near the castle the plump aigrettes build in incredible<br/>
numbers..<br/>
<br/>
We gave these different herons an unpleasant time,<br/>
and then, alas! had to leave this enchanting garden<br/>
hurriedly, just when its whispering boughs <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>steeped in<br/>
the golden light of the setting sun, in order to be in time for<br/>
dinner. We cast covetous glances at the shrubberies and<br/>
waving fields of corn, for I could easily guess how favourable this spot, enclosed by walls and perfectly still, must be<br/>
for beasts of prey. A few days later, Saurma, taking my<br/>
advice, went to shoot in this Shubra garden, and killed a<br/>
lynx and an ichneumon.<br/>
<br/>
On reaching Kasr-en-Nusha we dined with the two<br/>
brothers Saurma. The younger brother and Prince Taxis<br/>
had only returned the day before from a long and very<br/>
fatiguing expedition to the mountains of the Red Sea,.<br/>
where they had vainly sought the Arabian ibex.<br/>
<br/>
On the 24th of March the whole party drove out early<br/>
on the road to Heliopolis, to the extreme verge of the town,<br/>
where a large tent was placed on an open space decorated<br/>
with flags. There were a quantity of people present, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">q<br/>
</span>the Austro-Hungarian colony was there in full force, for we<br/>
were celebrating in festive fashion the laying of the stone<br/>
of an Austrian hospital. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Catouli-Bey</span>, a wealthy Jewish<br/>
merchant who is under Austrian protection, had, in the<br/>
most munificent way, found the whole of the money for this<br/>
good work, and was himself present in the old Hebrew<br/>
<br/>
dress. The ceremony was duly performed amidst cheers<br/>
<br/>
