<br/>
We next went to the government buildings to pay<br/>
our respects to the Pasha and governor. In the court<br/>
of the large Oriental building stood a guard of honour,<br/>
who received us with music. The friendly master took<br/>
his guests to the reception-room on the first <span style="color: #0000FF;">floor</span>. Matting<br/>
was spread over the floor, the walls were bare, and divans<br/>
covered with rich materials stood along the four walls, and<br/>
formed the sole furniture. We were ushered to seats with<br/>
formal Eastern etiquette, and excellent Turkish coffee,<br/>
with cigarettes and tobacco from the Lebanon, were served.<br/>
After a short visit we took leave of the Pasha, and left<br/>
the government buildings as we had entered them, to<br/>
the sound of trumpets.<br/>
<br/>
Our next visit was to the Coenaculum, the famous<br/>
chamber of the Last Supper, which lies in a house on the<br/>
margin of the town-very ancient, but now quite Mohammedan in its arrangements. We were shown in the same<br/>
house, amongst stones and rubbish, the tomb of David, on<br/>
which account the spot has an interest for the Moslem.<br/>
The old house belongs to a once wealthy family who trace<br/>
their descent direct from Osman. These people live in<br/>
wretched poverty, but wear large green turbans and bright<br/>
and picturesque, if somewhat tattered, clothes.<br/>
<br/>
In memory of their great ancestor they received us<br/>
in a manner which, though friendly, was full of condescension, and gave to our call not so much the<br/>
character of a visit to a historical site as that of a<br/>
homage to their own illustrious selves. The whole party<br/>
had therefore to sit on some <span style="color: #ff0000;">rhtten </span>divans in a half-open<br/>
corridor, to drink coffee out of dirty cups, and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">smoke<br/>
<br/>
