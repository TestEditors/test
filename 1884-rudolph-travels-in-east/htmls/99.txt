<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">CMn-Chalil-in </span>a quarter of its own, with covered shops<br/>
and existing from the days of the Mameluke Sultan <span style="color: #ff0000;">elAschraf </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Salaheddin </span>Chalil.<br/>
<br/>
Here you find the varied movement of Eastern life, the<br/>
most genuine articles of all kinds, all Oriental; and beside<br/>
them the products of negro lands, and especially of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Soudan..<br/>
<br/>
</span>In the carpet bazaar I went into the court of the house<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>rich merchant. The old man unrolled with the utmost<br/>
dignity his richest wares-Turkish and especially Persian<br/>
carpets of great value.<br/>
<br/>
After spending many hours in the Arab part of the<br/>
town we pushed our way through the thronged and narrow<br/>
streets back to the Muski. Glorious in colour and picturesque as Eastern life may seem, especially to travellers<br/>
accustomed to the moulded monotony of Europe, yet even<br/>
this Paradise has its dark side. <span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">place </span>in the first rank<br/>
the innumerable insects. Millions of large black flies fill<br/>
the streets, swarming round the Oriental, who never drives<br/>
them away, but allows his face to be quite covered by them.<br/>
These creatures carry dirt and infection with them into<br/>
the eyes, and this may explain the number of persons<br/>
afflicted with blindness and with the most loathsome<br/>
diseases of the eye. Generally speaking, one may say that<br/>
one sees in the street cripples and invalids and people<br/>
afflicted with diseases and defects of body of the possibility<br/>
of which the European had no previous conception.<br/>
<br/>
In the Muski we hired asses-those little skinny beasts<br/>
which with the high Arab saddle ply by thousands from<br/>
one end of Cairo to the other and take the place of cabs.<br/>
