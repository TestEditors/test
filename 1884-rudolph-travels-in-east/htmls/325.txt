<span>NOTES ON FAYUM. <span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>199<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I will here add to these historical quotations some notes<br/>
respecting Fayum, as it extended to the southern boundary<br/>
of the old territory of Memphis. The modern name owes<br/>
its origin to the old designation Pa-juma, i.e. the lake land,<br/>
with reference to the once most famous and now vanished<br/>
Lake Moeris.<br/>
<br/>
Lake Moeris lay formerly in the south-eastern part of<br/>
the oasis of Fayum, an artificial reservoir united with the<br/>
N ile by a broad canal, and a system of sluices served for<br/>
the reception of the surplus water of the overflow.<br/>
<br/>
The water conduits delivered the needful irrigation<br/>
to all the principal parts of the oasis, and converted this<br/>
once fruitless basin in the course of time into a garden<br/>
of God. In consequence of a lack of care on the part of<br/>
the Government the lake disappeared after its last waters<br/>
had found an outlet in the natural lake of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Birket-elKarun</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The whole country which surrounded Fayum was<br/>
reckoned by the old Egyptians as satanic, and for this.<br/>
reason it never appears in the sacred lists of towns and<br/>
names of districts.<br/>
<br/>
Here was the kingdom of Set, the Satan of the<br/>
Egyptians, and here the centre of worship of the crocodile,<br/>
so hated by the rest of the Egyptians, the servants of<br/>
Osiris. To the crocodile a special temple service was<br/>
devoted in the town of Crocodilopolis, in the neighbourhood of the Medinet-el-Fayum of the present day.<br/>
<br/>
Before I leave the most noteworthy and important<br/>
parts of Egypt which have drawn our attention for the last<br/>
two chapters to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">heat </span>traditions of the departed days of<br/>
the rule of the Pharaohs, I will add the subjoined list.<br/>
