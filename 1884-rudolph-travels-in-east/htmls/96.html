<span>48 TRAVELS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
morning to late at night along the whole length of the<br/>
Muski.<br/>
<br/>
The bazaars stretch to the right and left, with a labyrinth of narrow alleys and courts-the whole in guise of a<br/>
genuine rag fair whose interest consists chiefly in the display of Eastern wares, in the genuine character of the<br/>
native architecture, and above all, in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">demeanour </span>of the<br/>
buyers and sellers.<br/>
<br/>
The bazaar of the Christian traders, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stik-el-Hamzatiwi</span>,<br/>
and that of the spice-dealers, <span style="color: #ff0000;">fhlk-el-Atthrin</span>, and also <span style="color: #ff0000;">Stkel-Fahhtmi</span>, filled with Tunisian and Algerian goods, offer<br/>
much that is attractive. The quarter of the jewellers,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghtohargiye</span>, in the Jewish quarter, ind beyond this <span style="color: #ff0000;">StloessSaigh</span>, the bazaar of the gold and silversmiths; and lastly,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Silk-err-Nah/in</span>, that of the coppersmiths, were all<br/>
thoroughly examined by us.<br/>
<br/>
I bought some Arab ornaments, some old armour, and<br/>
some gold and silver work. The turbaned shopkeepers<br/>
sit in the open shop, with crossed legs, in loose robes,<br/>
smoking the chibouk or gulping down coffee. They follow<br/>
the stranger with eager looks, scanning his purpose. If<br/>
they perceive that he is ignorant or helpless, and unwitting<br/>
of the Eastern wiles, they give free course to their eloquence,<br/>
press the dearest articles upon him, and without the aid of<br/>
a skilful interpreter the luckless European is lost; he<br/>
spends all he has about him, and brings home articles that<br/>
are probably false and certainly hideous. In the bazaar<br/>
the Arab proves himself of true Semitic race, own brother<br/>
to the Jew, and scarcely to be distinguished from him.<br/>
<br/>
The most interesting of all the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairene </span>bazaars is the<br/>
