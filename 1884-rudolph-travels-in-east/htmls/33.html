which experience has since confirmed: green isles, washed<br/>
by the light blue waves, under a heaven of deepest blue,<br/>
and gilded by laughing <span style="color: #ff0000;">sunbeamts</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The individual details-the trees, entwined with ivy,<br/>
stretching above the rocks, the flowering shrubs, the<br/>
rippling springs, all have (forgive me the profane comparison) something decorative which reminds one of a<br/>
magic ballet-scene. One almost expects to see a lightly<br/>
girt Diana, waving her golden lance, step from the thicket.<br/>
But, to return to reality, the Miramar ran in close to the<br/>
town, where we, were to stop for some hours, to coal.<br/>
Corfu, usually so tranquil, now had a warlike aspect. On<br/>
the island Vido, opposite to the town, a camp had been<br/>

known before-a Iank little man of hideous appearance, the<br/>

The tidings that confluent <span style="color: #0000FF;">smalt-pox </span>prevailed in the<br/>
town was a blow to most of my companions, who had never<br/>
visited the island before. Landing was of course strictly<br/>
