<span>158 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

violently, and we could distinctly feel how the heavy vessel<br/>
was digging itself into the mud of the bed of the river.<br/>
We had frequently run aground on the voyage up stream,<br/>
as every Nile steamer does <span style="color: #0000FF;">in-consequence </span>of the shifting<br/>
of the sand-banks, but never had we run aground so hard<br/>
as we did on this occasion, owing to the force of our<br/>
downward course.<br/>
<br/>
The old admiral declared it would take at least two<br/>
hours to get his ship afloat again. We therefore went on<br/>
shore at a point called Kom-el-Emir, where high, steep,<br/>
rocky mountains come close to the stream, and a <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful </span>and brief defile immediately gives place to a cultivated<br/>
plain.<br/>
<br/>
The travelling party separated for sport in various<br/>
directions. I tried at first, by clambering on the bare<br/>
rocks, to creep up to some large birds of prey, but did not<br/>
succeed, and so I preferred to look for small game in the<br/>
bushes of the plain and on the bank of the river. Besides<br/>
several water-fowl, I got during this short expedition a<br/>
miniature dove, that wonderfully coloured dove of Central<br/>
Africa, the size of a lark and adorned with a long tail-a<br/>
charming and wholly tropical <span style="color: #0000FF;">creature</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>While looking on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">sand- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">banks </span>for <span style="color: #ff0000;">shore- </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">birds</span>, we<br/>
noticed at the end of a couple of hours that our steamer<br/>
was ready to pursue her voyage; so we rowed back at<br/>
once, and resumed the journey which had been interrupted<br/>
by this pleasant expedition.<br/>
<br/>
In the evening, after sunset, we lay to at <span style="color: #0000FF;">EI-Kab </span>on the<br/>
eastern bank. A slender strip of tilled land separates the<br/>
river at this point from the somewhat narrow desert, beyond<br/>
