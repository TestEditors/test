<span>SHOOTING A PELICAN. 89<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The spot where the winged company had rested must<br/>
be a daily frequented after-dinner haunt, for the whole<br/>
ground was covered with thick white guano. Long<br/>
feathers, too, were there, and the putrid remains of fish in<br/>
plenty.<br/>
<br/>
On my return to the camp we resolved once more to<br/>
divide the coast for our afternoon and evening campaign.<br/>
<br/>
I chose the spot where friend Pausinger had killed<br/>
his pelican in the morning. I crouched under a shrub<br/>
as well as I could, and hid my Arab porter behind me.<br/>
Each one of us had one of these dusky companions.<br/>
They fetch for you birds that drop in the sea, etc., only<br/>
one must never fall into long discourse with these <span style="color: #ff0000;">moneyloving </span>gentry, nor betray special pleasure at any particular<br/>
piece of success. Otherwise they begin to bargain, raising<br/>
the price constantly. With cunning foresight they calculate on the rising love of sport. The moment the game<br/>
falls one must show them a coin, and, before the dealing<br/>
begins, with well-meant friendly pressure drive them into<br/>
the water.<br/>
<br/>
I may have waited in vain for half an hour when a<br/>
pelican, visible from afar, took the direction of my ambush.<br/>
As soon as the bird was near enough I discharged<br/>
both barrels. The shot rattled loud on its thick feathered<br/>
coat of mail. The severely wounded bird sank with<br/>
languid <span style="color: #ff0000;">fraps </span>of the wings to the water. For a few<br/>
minutes it swam slowly round, but its head with its thick<br/>
beak sank lower and lower. At last the waves turned<br/>
it over and the pelican lay lifeless on its back.<br/>
<br/>
Neither money nor threats could persuade my Arab<br/>
