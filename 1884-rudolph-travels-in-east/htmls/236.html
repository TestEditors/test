The green land on this side now narrows apace, and offers<br/>
to sight a luxuriant but sorely neglected soil. Towns<br/>
are altogether wanting, and villages but very rare.<br/>
<br/>
Great flights (if storks passed northwards over the<br/>
Nile valley. Birds of prey soar aloft or settle on the<br/>
rocks, and the water-fowl of the river people the occasional sand-banks. In the afternoon the fine rocky defile<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Gebel-Selseleh</span>, with the sandstone mountains converging<br/>
from either side, delights the traveller who gazes from the<br/>
deck of his ship on this picturesque though stern and<br/>
gloomy land.<br/>
<br/>
In the evening, at sunset, we reached the northern<br/>
point of a large richly cultivated island. Taking the<br/>
eastern arm of the river, we soon saw the small but<br/>
charmingly placed temple of Kum Ombu.. This monument of antiquity is enthroned on the high, steep banks<br/>
of the river, their declivity clothed with vegetation.<br/>
The desolate temple is visible from afar, without town<br/>
or human habitation in the neighbourhood, wedged in<br/>
between the river and the desert. The desert here<br/>
advances in the form of a high plateau <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the edge of<br/>
the bushes on the bank. Mountains worthy of the name<br/>
there are none.<br/>
<br/>
As night was drawing on we lay to below the temple;<br/>
beside us was a dahabiya occupied by Europeans. The<br/>
dragoman of this party, the experienced Dalmatian<br/>
sportsman <span style="color: #ff0000;">Paulowich</span>, came on board, and advised us<br/>
after dinner to take a bleating kid into the temple, and<br/>
there, hiding ourselves well, to watch for wolves.<br/>
<br/>
No sooner said than done. At nine o'clock Hoyos<br/>
