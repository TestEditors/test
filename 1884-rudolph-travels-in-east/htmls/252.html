howling, passed to their home in the desert; but, in spite<br/>
of all that, a jackal appeared on a little windmill hill, to<br/>
vanish immediately behind the stones.<br/>
<br/>
As twilight was coming on perceptibly, we hastened<br/>
into the city of graves. A jackal ran by, and a happy shot<br/>
stretched him on the ground. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ear </span>the foot of the hill, on<br/>
whose top we had shot the carrion vulture in the afternoon,<br/>
and not far from the last graves, there is an old tank in a<br/>
little valley formed by sand-hills.<br/>
<br/>
A carcase had been placed there previously, and we<br/>

A piteous moaning was the response to my shot, and<br/>
hastening to the spot I saw a large wolf making painful<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">efforts </span>to drag himself farther. A second load of large shot<br/>
laid the tough beast low.<br/>
<br/>
I now took the wolf on my back, and went one hundred<br/>
paces further towards my comrade, who was hidden in<br/>
another place. The seemingly dead beast was heavy, and<br/>
