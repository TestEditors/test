<span>296 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

hill. We went up to the top by a winding path. A<br/>
small chapel with a kind of <span style="color: #0000FF;">circular </span>drum and insignificant<br/>
cupola covers the spot from which Christ ascended to<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">heairen</span>. The prints of the Redeemer's feet remain on<br/>
a slab of marble.<br/>
<br/>
The place belongs to the Mohammedans, and is held<br/>
sacred by them, but they permit the Christians to say<br/>
Mass there on certain days. By the chapel is a minaret;<br/>
sbme <span style="color: #ff0000;">nariow </span>steps lead first inside, and then, as usual, to<br/>
the outside. The rail is broken and the stones are<br/>
slippery, and not to be recommended to persons liable<br/>
to vertigo. From the summit there is a splendid view<br/>
of Jerusalem and the hills which divide the plateau and<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">rieighbourhood </span>of the Holy City and Bethlehem <span style="color: #0000FF;">froth<br/>
</span>the Valley of the Jordan. They<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>are grey-green hills<br/>
like <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppes</span>. In the remote distance one can discern<br/>
the high mountains east of the-Jordan and of the Dead<br/>
Sea, and through the inlet of a valley a glimpse is caught<br/>
of the dark-blue mirror of the inland sea.<br/>
<br/>
The Mount of Olives and the buildings on it are<br/>
terribly neglected. The Garden of Gethsemane, at its<br/>
foot, alone bears trace of the care given to it by the<br/>
Franciscans, to whom it belongs. A monk lives in the<br/>
small house beside it to take <span style="color: #ff0000;">charge.- </span>The Mount of<br/>
Olives and Gethsemane wake most solemn thoughts.<br/>
Every stone attests the truth of tradition, and one seems<br/>
to behold the story of the Passion in living pictures.<br/>
I felt as though I had known these two spots all my<br/>
life; so completely did the reality accord with the<br/>
pictures which imagination had framed of them<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
