<br/>
to the picturesque Maltese castle. On arriving there we<br/>
decided to beat one of the adjoining barren hills regularly<br/>
through. We requisitioned as many heaters as possible;<br/>
servants of Count Caboga, our own grooms from the camp,<br/>
shepherds and country folk out for a walk-all were taken<br/>
along with us. One part of the gentlemen placed <span style="color: #0000FF;">them</span>,<br/>
selves to shoot in the valley on the southern slope of the<br/>
hill, while Hoyos, the huntsmen, and I placed the line<br/>
of <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters </span>and at a given signal began to beat; several<br/>
Turkish gendarmes also assisted and showed decided gifts<br/>
for that kind of sport.<br/>
<br/>
Some partridges, an unfortunate quail, and a jackal flew<br/>
or crept up in front of us, but unluckily did not take the<br/>
direction of the guns. It was not till the end of the beating<br/>
that some birds passed above the gentlemen, of which one<br/>
was shot. One genuine grey Syrian hare came within<br/>
fire, and was shot by <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chorinsky</span>. It was thinner, smaller,<br/>
and much darker than our field hare, but more like that<br/>
than the African desert hare.<br/>
<br/>
After this not brilliantly successful beat we went past<br/>
the hyaena ambush, to the convent of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mar-Elyhs</span>, whence<br/>
a splendid view of Jerusalem could be had. It was our<br/>
last view of the Holy City and its environs. Thence our<br/>
course lay eastward and then to the north.<br/>
<br/>
From the convent we resolved to make a long drive on<br/>
the principle of Bohemian partridge shooting, at one<br/>
stretch up to our camp. It was a long distance, and over<br/>
very broken ground; one hill rose behind another, and all<br/>
were separated by steep valleys. We made the <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters </span>go<br/>
further apart, and I planted the gentlemen and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hunts<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
