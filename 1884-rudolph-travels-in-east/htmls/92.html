and Cairo disappears from the page of history, and only<br/>
enters it again with the Egyptian campaign of Napoleon<br/>
Buonaparte.<br/>
<br/>
All these historical incidents from the days of old Islam,<br/>
are present to our thoughts as we enter the mosque, converted into a school in the reign of Caliph Aziz <span style="color: #0000FF;">Billah</span>,<br/>
975-996. It is still the most famous university of the East,<br/>
and likewise the breeding-place of Mohammedan fanaticism.<br/>
<br/>
The whole range of buildings is very extensive, and<br/>
halls, galleries, and colonnades follow each other. Beside<br/>
the principal gate I amused myself by watching the ways<br/>
of the genuine Eastern barbers. Squatted on the ground,<br/>
they hold the heads of their victims between their knees<br/>
and rub in acrid soap. Hereupon they scrape and shave<br/>
till the skull is as smooth as glass, for the true <span style="color: #ff0000;">Islamite<br/>
</span>wears no hair on his head; only the poorest peasant or<br/>
wild Bedouin will wear hair. In the towns a bald head<br/>
counts for a great mark of beauty.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">With </span>graceful movement the hair-dressers of the East<br/>
toil, clip, and wash, and an odour of rose oil and other<br/>
scented ointments pervades the scene of their activity.<br/>
<br/>
From hence we went past a small subsidiary mosque<br/>
into the great court, with its cisterns for the holy ablutions.<br/>
The surrounding corridors are divided by wooden partitions<br/>
and lattices into halls, in which the manuscripts are kept.<br/>
On the eastern side of the court is the vast sanctuary of the<br/>
mosque, adorned with three hundred and eighty columns of<br/>
marble, porphyry, and granite, and decked with relics of<br/>
antiquity brought together without much regard to congruity. Four praying-places for the four recognized <span style="color: #ff0000;">sects<br/>
