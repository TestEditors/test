</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Kasr-en-Nusha</span>, to put on our shooting suits, and after<br/>
a brief pause the whole party started on an excursion to<br/>
the vice-regal country <span style="color: #0000FF;">Yeats </span>of Gezireh and Gizeh outside<br/>
the <span style="color: #0000FF;">city</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>The gardens are of quite unique beauty, with lakes,<br/>
water-works, fountains, kiosks, hidden green alleys, and<br/>
shady paths, a richness of verdure and a wealth of flowers<br/>
of almost overpowering perfume such as only this <span style="color: #0000FF;">climate<br/>
</span>could produce. The refined taste and luxurious habits of<br/>
Orientals <span style="color: #0000FF;">inured </span>by the heat of the climate to inactive lives<br/>
could alone devise such a thing. The gorgeous visions<br/>
portrayed in the sensuous fairy-tales of the East were here<br/>
realized; and here, as in the fairy-tales, enjoyment was<br/>
made the sole purpose of life. The menagerie, so famous<br/>
under the last Viceroy, unfortunately no longer exists, and<br/>
we found only empty cages.<br/>
<br/>
The house itself did not please us so much. The<br/>
building was vast, of no particular style, but almost wholly<br/>
European, a bit of Arab decoration here and there alone'<br/>
telling of the East. In the interior the great staircases<br/>
and halls, and, above all, the innumerable rooms, seemed<br/>
Western; but they were at once over-coloured and <span style="color: #0000FF;">bald..<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">looking</span>. Some divans beautifully covered, cool marble<br/>
pavements, little window niches, vases with running water,<br/>
and charming baths, reminded us that we were in the<br/>
East.<br/>
<br/>
The many palaces in and around Cairo are almost<br/>
all uninhabited. Some old princesses wear their dreary<br/>
lives to an end in them, and as keeping the buildings up<br/>
would cost enormous sums, they are allowed to fall to<br/>
<br/>
