forth. In fact, the constant irrigation of the soil of the<br/>
desert at this point has produced a luxuriance of vegetation<br/>
which is scarcely equalled elsewhere.<br/>
<br/>
"After you have turned to the left in front of Tewfik<br/>
Pasha's palace, a broad cultivated plain opens behind an<br/>
olive wood. Here, on the 20th day of March, 1800,<br/>
General <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kleber</span>, with 10,000 French, won a splendid victory<br/>
over 60,000 <span style="color: #0000FF;">Turkish </span>and Egyptian troops.<br/>
<br/>
"Beyond the village of Matariye, to the left of the road,<br/>
you see the much-visited and often-described'Tree of<br/>
Mary'--<span style="color: #ff0000;">--</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>sycamore some two hundred years old (its<br/>
predecessor perished in the year <span style="color: #ff0000;">166 </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">5</span>), under whose shade<br/>
the Virgin and Child are said to have rested on the flight<br/>
into Egypt. The garden round the tree is watered from a<br/>
spring, after which the Arabs have sometimes called Heliopolis <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ain-sherus</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fountain </span>of the Sun.'<br/>
<br/>
"At some distance from the garden, and entirely on<br/>
desert ground, is the ostrich farm, recently established by.<br/>
a French company, under the immediate superintendence<br/>
of a Swiss gentleman, named Wetter. The eggs of the<br/>
ostriches are hatched by artificial heat, and the young<br/>
birds tended with the utmost care. For four years past<br/>
birds have been bred, whose parents came partly from the<br/>
Soudan and partly from Abyssinia. In March, 1881, the<br/>
total number of birds, without distinction of age or sex,<br/>
was sixty.<br/>
<br/>
"A quarter of a league distant from this farm lie the<br/>
above-described ruins of Heliopolis. In this still solitude<br/>
the obelisk, sole witness of a long bygone day, <span style="color: #0000FF;">waits </span>its<br/>
greeting from afar to the modern traveller, and waits <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
