step, but we were too weary to fire, and only thought of<br/>
our camp. A merry, plashing brook with tolerably clear<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">wat'er </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">gave </span>us passing refreshment, and we went on again.<br/>
Night had fully set in, and some fires sparkled among the<br/>
bushes. It was the camp of the Bedouins who had been<br/>
appointed to attend us. Their tall figures looked ghostly<br/>
in their long white <span style="color: #ff0000;">burhous </span>and the dull reflections of the<br/>
dying embers. The long lances rose high, and rough<br/>
Arab gutturals and melancholy songs resounded through<br/>
the night. The horses were rolling in the grass, and the<br/>
dogs ran barking to meet us. Chorinsky and I passed<br/>
among these sons of the desert, who gave us friendly<br/>
greeting, and reached us cooling drinks as we went by.<br/>
Yet another quarter of an hour, and we came to our <span style="color: #0000FF;">vivacious </span>Druses, the servants of Howard, and the mules;<br/>
beside these the Turkish cavalry were encamped. Another<br/>
hundred paces and we had reached our tents.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">_ </span>After sunset the oppressive heat increased so much that,<br/>
even during the night, we all lay bathed in perspiration, and<br/>
some of the gentlemen and servants became unwell from<br/>
the unwonted closeness of the air. Despite the deeply<br/>
interesting experiences of the day, and our successes in<br/>
sport, a strange depression of spirits seemed to prevail<br/>
among the whole travelling party. This was yet to increase<br/>
in the following days. The climate of the Valley of the<br/>
Jordan has a distressing effect on all Europeans.<br/>
<br/>
Early on the 6th we determined to divide into parties<br/>
for our sport. Several of the gentlemen went in the<br/>
direction we had taken the day before. The Grand Duke<br/>
and I, accompanied by Salim and his people, rode <span style="color: #0000FF;">through<br/>
