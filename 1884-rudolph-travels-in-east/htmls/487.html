The story of the jackals appearing every evening<br/>
attracted me, and, obtaining leave from the monks, I crept<br/>
down all the ladders and galleries into the ravine, and<br/>
crouched beside some stones near an old tank. The spot<br/>
was stern and dismal-the bare rock in front, the rocky<br/>
habitations of the monks behind, above my head a narrow<br/>
strip of blue sky. As evening drew on the starlings,<br/>
falcons, and pigeons flew to their holes, and only now and<br/>
then the brief song of a bird was heard. One might fancy<br/>
one's self in the days of St. Saba.<br/>
<br/>
It began to grow dark. The Greek bells called aloud<br/>
to prayer. The last sound had hardly died away when a<br/>
bit of bread fell close beside me; a moment after, and a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">jackal </span>stood not twenty steps off. A successful shot killed<br/>
him. I was glad to hurry up with my prey out of the<br/>
terrible gorge which is at the level of the Mediterranean.<br/>
<br/>
A leaden air such as I never felt before seemed to stop<br/>
one's breath, and hang like a weight on the whole body.<br/>
In the next days we were to go lower still, and to be yet.<br/>
more oppressed by this malarious atmosphere.<br/>
<br/>
I climbed the whole way up through the convent, and,<br/>
taking leave of the pious monks, we hastened out through<br/>
the tower at the top, but it was quite dark when we reached<br/>
our camp. We dined and made our plans <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the next day,<br/>
and by ten stillness resumed its sway in the desolate valley.<br/>
<br/>
At sunrise the party assembled at breakfast<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>We were<br/>
at table, when a <span style="color: #0000FF;">carrion </span>vulture had the audacity to stroll<br/>
into the camp and settle itself to consume some waste from<br/>
the kitchen between the tents. The Grand Duke fetched<br/>
his gun and shot the daring bird.<br/>
