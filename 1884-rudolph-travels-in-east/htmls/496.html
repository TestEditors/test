<span>332 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

the mountain, and at once found ourselves among thick<br/>
bushes and on excellent sandy riding ground. Patches of<br/>
luxuriant shrubs alternated with grassy flats, and we passed<br/>
these stretches at full'gallop. We rode down an old, now<br/>
dried-up torrent, and forcing our way among high reeds,<br/>
long grass, and tall shrubs, reached the flat sandy shore of<br/>
the Dead Sea.<br/>
<br/>
Every step of the horses could be felt cracking the<br/>
crust like that of frozen snow. The sand here is all coated<br/>
with saltpetre, and so are pieces of wood which have been<br/>
washed up.'The <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bahr..Liit </span>(Lot's Lake), as the Arabs call<br/>
the Dead Sea, since Mohammed has admitted the story of<br/>
Lot into the Koran, is a wonderful mountain lake. Deep<br/>
blue, large, and well shaped, it is bounded on the east by<br/>
the jagged grey-green hills that had been in view for the<br/>
last days, and on the west by really lofty mountains with<br/>
their whitish-grey cliffs.<br/>
<br/>
The water itself, a thick heavy mixture strongly impregnated with minerals, makes life impossible to every kind<br/>
of animal, and the lake is in fact quite dead. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Some </span>of the<br/>
gentlemen tried to bathe; to drown would be impossible,<br/>
for the human body will not sink in it. On the other hand,<br/>
thick salt deposits are made by it on the skip which do not<br/>
improve one's comfort.<br/>
<br/>
The air at the Dead Sea is like lead, resembling that<br/>
breathed in deep mines, and prostrates every one. This<br/>
effect is in consequence of its low level, for the water of<br/>
the Dead Sea is 394 metres below that of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mediterranean</span>. We rode for a short distance close along the<br/>
shore, and then bent northwards across flats of sand <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
