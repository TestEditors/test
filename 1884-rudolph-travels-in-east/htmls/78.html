</span>and rich gardens of the wealthy. We saw from afar the<br/>
entrance of the Arab quarter. The wild confusion of the<br/>
streets amused us-European carriages, miserable droskies,<br/>
donkeys for riding and for draft, mules, camels, rich and<br/>
poor, beggars and gay Eastern folk, genuine <span style="color: #ff0000;">Islamites </span>and<br/>
half-European Levantines; and besides all this the great<br/>
crowd of Western <span style="color: #0000FF;">folk-tourists</span>, and the like. Passing<br/>
Kasr-en-Nil we soon reached, driving across the bridge,<br/>
the dykes and avenues which run between all the great<br/>
gardens opposite to the city.<br/>
<br/>
Near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tussum </span>Pasha's castle, surrounded by canals and<br/>
water-meadows, are extensive sugar-cane plantations. In<br/>
one of these we proposed to hunt. Prince Taxis and the<br/>
brother of Baron Saurma were on the spot waiting for us<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>The guns were placed and the dogs loosed.<br/>
<br/>

scent; <span style="color: #0000FF;">at</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span>the chase began; a loud yelping approached<br/>
the border of the field. Unluckily the wolf left his hiding<br/>
at a spot where no gun was posted, and so we crossed a<br/>
broad canal to another plantation. The dogs were let loose<br/>
once more, but we were soon compelled to desist from our<br/>
sport by the melancholy discovery, made while the dogs<br/>
were driving the game, that the cutting of the sugar-cane<br/>
had commenced on one side of the field.<br/>
<br/>
Numerous labourers-very poor and scantily clad fellaheen, though some of them of most striking <span style="color: #0000FF;">appearance-were </span>working under the direction of an overseer robed in<br/>
long full garments, and wielding a scourge made of thongs<br/>
of rhinoceros hide. This worthy approached me with much<br/>
dignity, and made a long speech accompanied with much<br/>
