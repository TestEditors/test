<br/>
<br/>
There were but few guests in the neglected English<br/>
hotel; only some English men of business taking brief rest<br/>
on the great highway between Europe and India, and an<br/>
unfortunate but extremely amusing missionary, a Saxon<br/>
lieutenant in the Reserve and preacher all in one. He<br/>
desired to convert the natives in the interior of Africa, and<br/>
was well up in the theory, both of the importance of his<br/>
mission and of the country to which he was proceeding, but<br/>
in practice he seemed devoid of tact, experience, and above<br/>
all of money, and to be awaiting in the hotel at Suez what<br/>
favourable chances might bring. We rose early on the<br/>
morning of the 25th of March, and after a hasty breakfast<br/>
left the hotel and went through the town to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">landingplace </span>of the steamers.<br/>
<br/>
I am indebted to my friend Brugsch Pasha for such<br/>
an admirable description of this district, that I cannot do<br/>
better than quote the letter, so rich in scientific observation,<br/>
of this eminent scholar.<br/>
<br/>
"On the north side of the town there is a small hill<br/>
piled with ruins, whose Arab name Tell-Kolzum (Hill of<br/>
Kolzum) recalls its more ancient name Clysma, which was<br/>
that of a well-built harbour-fortress, formerly existing on<br/>
this spot. With the decay of the old canal the town lost<br/>
its importance, but its memory is still kept alive by Arab<br/>
authors, who often employ the name Bahr-Kolzum to<br/>
designate the present Gulf of Suez. Instructive as may<br/>
be a visit to the modern harbour, with its works, dykes,<br/>
and the mouths and sluices of the sea and sweet water<br/>
canals, it can only tell us of the chief doings of our own day<br/>
ii, the domain of mechanical engineering applied to water.<br/>
