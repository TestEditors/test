me) and of his son and successor Ramses II. (1300 B.C.)<br/>
are the most conspicuous of the buildings which the ravages<br/>
of time have, at least in part, spared. The temple of<br/>
the first-named king is especially marvellous from the<br/>
beauty of the paintings, and hieroglyphic inscriptions which<br/>
cover its walls <span style="color: #0000FF;">and.pillars</span>, and which belong to the most<br/>
perfect period of Egyptian art. The same temple has<br/>
obtained special celebrity for its list of kings, which gives<br/>
the names of seventy-seven of the Pharaohs in succession<br/>
from Mena, the first king (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Manes </span>of the Greeks), to<br/>
Ramses <span style="color: #ff0000;">II.</span>, and is now the invaluable basis of all<br/>
researches in the domain of old Egyptian history<span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>The second funeral temple, built by Ramses IL, lies<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the north of the first. It is less well preserved than<br/>
the other, but its remains, consisting of fine-grained<br/>
limestone and blocks of alabaster and granite, retain on<br/>
their smooth surfaces numerous painted representations<br/>
and inscriptions, which are of the highest value for the<br/>
history, geography, and mythology of ancient Egypt. A.<br/>
number of <span style="color: #0000FF;">gravestone </span>from the Necropolis of Abydus<br/>
have found their way to Vienna.<br/>

While we were examining the halls and chambers of<br/>
the temples I saw some vultures from the adjacent<br/>
desert mountains pass over our heads and circle high in<br/>
the air. We instantly resolved to entice these great birds<br/>
of prey, and now the question was where to find a.<br/>
favourable place on which <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>lay the carrion out.<br/>

Behind the temples are some high piles of rubbish<br/>
and heaps of stones, from which one obtains an unimpeded<br/>
