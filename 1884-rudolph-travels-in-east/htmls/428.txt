<span>282 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Austrian hospice, accompanied by the Turkish authorities.<br/>
The hospice is a spacious building, with roomy apartments<br/>
and a very fine chapel. We reached the gate by a <span style="color: #0000FF;">flight </span>of<br/>
steps from the street. The superintendent of the hospice<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-a </span>priest and a most worthy Tyrolese--received me.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately on our arrival we had to receive the<br/>
consuls, and then the Turkish authorities and the ruler of<br/>
the city, all in Eastern costume, and finally the heads of all<br/>
the Christian and Jewish Churches. The Latin patriarch<br/>
came attended by priests and monks, the Greek patriarch<br/>
with his popes; then the Armenians, then Copts, and<br/>
then the Syrian patriarch. The Syrian Church is a most<br/>
interesting one, and is represented in Jerusalem by a<br/>
venerable grey-bearded <span style="color: #0000FF;">man</span>, who appeared in his flowing<br/>
black vestments, with aveil depending from his pope's cap.<br/>
The ancient sect of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jacobeans </span>is, so far as I know, the<br/>
earliest which separated from the primitive Church in the<br/>
first ages of Christianity. It holds its ground still in<br/>
Asia Minor. They pay homage to St. James beyond the<br/>
measure rendered by the other Churches.<br/>
<br/>
Last of all, the rabbis waited on us, their president at<br/>
their head, one of the priests in the ecclesiastical hierarchy<br/>
of the Hebrews of the day. This old man, with his long<br/>
snowy beard, yellow waxen complexion, and fine features,<br/>
was born in Spain, and wore, like most of the rabbis<br/>
residing in Palestine, the ancient Hebrew dress, the<br/>
coloured full overcoat trimmed with fur, the turban, a long.<br/>
robe, and yellow slippers. I have always imagined that the<br/>
Pharisees must have looked like these rabbis.<br/>
<br/>
After all these most interesting visitors had left us, <span style="color: #0000FF;">we<br/>
