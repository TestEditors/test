poor inhabitants, and thousands of half-wild wood-pigeons<br/>
hover round in the vicinity of their dwellings.<br/>
<br/>
In Egypt, wherever the land rises above the level of<br/>
the Valley of the Nile, so that the waters of the stream<br/>
do not overflow it, there begins at once the full, complete<br/>
barrenness of the desert.<br/>
<br/>
This observation could be verified here at the last<br/>
houses of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arabit-el-Maditne</span>. From the richest green<br/>
of African verdure you step abruptly, without any transition, on to the dazzling white sand of the desert.<br/>

The very interesting field of the ruins of Abydus,<br/>
whose well-preserved remains and walls rich in paintings<br/>
amaze and delight the traveller, lies among stones and<br/>
rubbish a few hundred yards from the village.<br/>

With <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>touch, as it were, you find yourself in the<br/>
midst of a long bygone age, whose fairest memorials<br/>
have been preserved uninjured for us by the beautiful<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>

From the time of the sixth dynasty (about 3300<br/>
B.C.) a spot close on the edge of the desert, whose<br/>
ancient name was Abidu, came to be regarded as the<br/>
consecrated burying-place of Osiris of Upper Egypt.<br/>
Hence the natural desire of the old Egyptians to find<br/>
on this spot, in the sand of the desert, their last abode.<br/>
Numerous chapels of private persons and magnificent<br/>
temples to individual kings of the country rose around on<br/>
the desert soil, and attracted visitors to pay pious honours<br/>
to the good Osiris, king of the dead, and to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">memory<br/>
</span>of the departed. The temples of King Seti I. (<span style="color: #ff0000;">1360<br/>
