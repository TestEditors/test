distribute the life-giving water, which they draw with a big<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">spoon-shaped </span>implement from the channels, distinguishing<br/>
features of the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
We glide along past towns and villages. Light-green<br/>
palms, soaring minarets, and broad towered dove-cotes are<br/>
the features of the clay-built, earth-coloured villages, whose<br/>
ruinous disorder has an unmistakably picturesque character.<br/>
Innumerable kites hover about the human habitations; the<br/>
yelp of dogs, the bellowing of buffaloes, donkeys, and<br/>
camels, the screams of Arabs and the wailing sound of the<br/>
water-wheels, dust, dirt, and disorder, are the customary<br/>
accessories.<br/>
<br/>
Great vultures stand on the long sand-banks, and white<br/>
carrion vultures beside carcases which have floated to<br/>
the surface. Flights of cranes, storks, spoonbills, grey<br/>
herons, pelicans, and Nile geese, together with numerous<br/>
kinds of ducks, give movement to the scene. On the<br/>
broken ground of the banks the spurred-peewit, <span style="color: #ff0000;">waterwagtails</span>, grey-fishers, swallows, and an army of small <span style="color: #ff0000;">sandbirds </span>disport themselves. The Europeans fire from every<br/>
steamer and every dahabiya on all the water-fowl which<br/>
are here in their winter quarters. No very productive<br/>
sport can therefore be expected by shooting from the deck,<br/>
for at the sight of a vessel in the far distance the frightened<br/>
birds take flight.<br/>
<br/>
We came past the township of Abu Tig, where the<br/>
mountains recede and leave space for a well-cultivated<br/>
plain; but immediately after the lofty <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gebel-Sh√©ch-Hai1de</span>,<br/>
pierced with ancient quarries and pits, advances to the very<br/>
<br/>
edge of the stream<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
