<br/>
shoot and delicious to eat-most desirable game, therefore,<br/>
for the travelling sportsman. Each of us took some<br/>
Bedouins or servants to shoot over an appointed spot.<br/>
We had divided the best plots near the village in welldefined circuits, in order that one gun might not interfere<br/>
with the other.<br/>
<br/>
I was in full swing, when suddenly a violent fit of<br/>
dizziness came over me; a feeling like that of paralysis<br/>
disabled my feet; severe headache, and, despite the heat,<br/>
an icy chill over my whole body, compelled me to crawl<br/>
home as best I could. An attack of fever, which in this<br/>
climate will come on in a few minutes, had changed my<br/>
good health into sickness<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>All my muscles ached and<br/>
every movement was painful. The other gentlemen came<br/>
home with a nice supply of <span style="color: #ff0000;">frankolin</span>. During the night<br/>
the unfortunate Chorinsky, and later Sachs also, were<br/>
bitten by a large scorpion. Chorinsky received the first<br/>
full strength of the poison from the abominable beast,<br/>
and exhibited symptoms of severe poisoning which caused<br/>
the utmost anxiety. Next morning there was a general<br/>
depression in the camp. Every one had to pay some<br/>
penalty <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>the bad air. Chorinsky and I, still languid and<br/>
miserable, had to be kept on the sick list, and there<br/>
were also some victims of the climate among the <span style="color: #ff0000;">servants.<br/>
</span>' Any moment might bring further attacks of fever, and the<br/>
adventure with the Asiatic scorpion spread a certain panic<br/>
through the caravan.<br/>
<br/>
Our original intention had been to spend this day also<br/>
in <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baisan</span>, then to make an expedition to the Lake <span style="color: #0000FF;">of<br/>
</span>Gennesareth, and from thence to go on to Nazareth <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
