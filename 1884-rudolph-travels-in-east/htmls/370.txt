<span>236 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
part of the city, where there are literally more heaps of<br/>
rubbish, tombs, ruins of old mosques, and filth of all kinds,<br/>
than there are habitable houses. At. the end of a narrow<br/>
street, closed up by ruins, we stopped and entered through a<br/>
gate a court adorned by shady colonnades lined with plants.<br/>
<br/>
Another ancient circular mosque struck us by its<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">ruinous </span>appearance. An old man, portly and with a<br/>
friendly smile, a round turban on his head, and robed in gay<br/>
and genuine Turkish apparel, received us. We followed<br/>
him through a narrow door to the interior of the mosque.<br/>
The stones were covered with sheepskins; old <span style="color: #0000FF;">rusty<br/>
</span>armour, lances, swords, sabres, jagged swords, and, in<br/>
their centre, an already much tattered green banner, hung<br/>
on the walls. These consecrated weapons must have drunk<br/>
the blood of the unbelievers to be hung in this holy place.<br/>
<br/>
When a war for the true faith begins, the dervishes<br/>
of this sect (a far more warlike order than that of the<br/>
turning dervishes) take the armour down, unfold the green<br/>
standard of the Prophet, and run howling through the<br/>
streets, vowing war and death to unbelievers, and rousing<br/>
the Moslems to the holy war. In the old Turkish wars<br/>
these people played a great part, and Islam still guarantees<br/>
that they shall always find a field for their activity.<br/>
<br/>
We had hardly got into the mosque when the pious<br/>
men came in. The old man who had received us placed<br/>
himself in the centre on a sheepskin; his subordinates<br/>
made a circle round. He prayed aloud, the same thing<br/>
over and over again, which every one repeated after him<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Music, like that of the turning dervishes, struck in, and its<br/>
wild melodies were accompanied by constant movements <span style="color: #0000FF;">in<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
