of those regions, that I greatly preferred to bathe in a<br/>
narrow and somewhat dirty tributary brook, in the company<br/>
of harmless toads and frogs, and where I could thoroughly<br/>
examine the locality first.<br/>
<br/>
Returning to the principal stream, we found a tent<br/>
and the kitchen already in their places; we were therefore sure soon to breakfast, though in terrible heat and<br/>
surrounded by a swarm of large and disgusting flies. We<br/>
agreed to devote the afternoon to sport. Some of the<br/>
gentlemen were to follow the brook out into the great<br/>
plain, while the Grand Duke and I were to push up into<br/>
the interior of the valley. Under the guidance of Salim<br/>
and the other sheiks, we tried to beat the thick shrubs<br/>

topmost shoots dyed with the crimson of the splendid<br/>
oleander blossom. A wondrous perfume, the true odour<br/>

circumstances there could be no talk of sport. Every<br/>
step brought new torture, and we escaped as quickly as<br/>

to regions of <span style="color: #ff0000;">scantier </span>vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
The great abundance of many kinds of bright-coloured<br/>
lizards in this garden of anguish had struck me--at every<br/>
step and turn reptiles rustled in the grass. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">made<br/>
