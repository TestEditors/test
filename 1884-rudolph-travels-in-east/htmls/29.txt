</span>in store for us. The greater part of the travellers were<br/>
ill; and that depressed mood which the humours of the<br/>
tricksy sea produce in many persons was very apparent.<br/>
Sick and well sat on the deck looking at the unquiet<br/>
waves. About IO a.m. the steep cliffs of Lissa came in<br/>
sight. Every Austrian looks with emotion on that island,<br/>
the witness of the noble deeds of our heroic sailors.<br/>
<br/>
In point of scenery Lissa has nothing to <span style="color: #0000FF;">offer-a </span>barren<br/>
stony island with cliffs and hills without variety or <span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesque </span>character.<br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon the sea rose, and towards evening<br/>
flashes of lightning were followed by distant thunder. The<br/>
day passed monotonously, as the motion of the vessel forbade reading or writing, and our course lay far from the<br/>
coast on the open sea. The night was even worse, and the<br/>
sea-sick passengers could but endure, while the tedious<br/>
hours went by. The morning of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">nth </span>brought us at<br/>
sunrise a much quieter sea, and as we hastened on deck<br/>
the white summits of the Albanian mountains greeted <span style="color: #0000FF;">us</span>.<br/>
Much snow lay upon the highest tops.<br/>
<br/>
The mountains of Albania have a special charm for the<br/>
traveller. From the ship you see them rise in terraced<br/>
layers, and catch glimpses of the fine rocky valleys, or<br/>
admire the cliffs which descend <span style="color: #0000FF;">precipitously </span>into the sea.<br/>
<br/>
To me the mountains of the South are far more attractive<br/>
than the Alps of Central Europe. Their forms, the warmer<br/>
light, and the contrasts between snow, deep blue sky, and<br/>
southern vegetation are far more interesting than the<br/>
uniformity of the pine woods, with the dull, leaden, lightless<br/>
sky above.<br/>
