<span>366 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Old cut stones and daris in the midst of the now<br/>
overgrown vegetation in the immediate proximity of a<br/>
wretched village, consisting of a few stone huts, bear witness<br/>
to the former but long-forgotten importance and culture of<br/>
the place. In old Biblical times the Canaanites dwelt here.<br/>
The city was taken later by David. When conquered by<br/>
the Scythians it received from the Greeks the name of<br/>
Scythopolis. In the days of the Romans it was a rich and<br/>
flourishing place, and Cleopatra had her meeting here with<br/>
Alexander Jannaeus. Pompey advanced through <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baisan </span>to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Judaea</span>. In early Christian times the town was the seat of<br/>
a bishop and' famous as the birthplace of Basilides and<br/>
Cyrillus. Saladin conquered the town and burnt it to the<br/>
ground, and it lost for ever its greatness and power.<br/>
<br/>
The last relics of an old theatre and some temples, and<br/>
of many columns of basalt buried in the bushes and marsh<br/>
grass, still remain. It is a gloomy, marshy place, damp and<br/>
unwholesome, filled with the unceasing cry of toads and<br/>
frogs. In the wretchedly filthy village, the ruined inhabitants<br/>
seemed to be starving beside their damp stone walls, and<br/>
children and dogs rolled on the sodden marshy ground.<br/>
We found our camp already pitched and in the best order<br/>
on the north side of the village. Close beside it a ravine<br/>
fell steeply down, within which a spring was running gaily<br/>
among rocks, shrubs, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores </span>with their spreading<br/>
branches. We saw here traces of Roman baths hewn in<br/>
the rock. Above our camp, to the west of the village, is<br/>
the plateau and the region of the springs.<br/>
<br/>
On our arrival I went at once with a hunting Bedouin,<br/>
who was waiting for me by my tent, to the damp marsh<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
