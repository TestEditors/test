five cupolas, the Mount of Olives, and to the right the<br/>
Greek Convent of the Crucifixion. The Holy City itself<br/>
we could not yet see.<br/>
<br/>
On the road there was a great triumphal arch with<br/>
a Hungarian inscription. The Jewish colony stood beside<br/>
it with banners, singing the National Hymn. With many<br/>
compliments and the usual talk and noise the patriotic<br/>
Jews surrounded us. They were genuine Israelites from<br/>
the north of Hungary. They wore the caftan, high<br/>
boots, the velvet cap, the curled beard, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>accustomed<br/>
ringlets. You might have supposed you were in a<br/>
Carpathian village.<br/>
<br/>
The whole Jewish community followed us from this<br/>
point as a matter of course. Both sides of the road were<br/>
already thronged with people. Jews of all countries,<br/>
Christians from Asia Minor, Greeks, European pilgrims,<br/>
Oriental Christian women, some partly and some not at<br/>
all veiled, in most picturesque costumes only to be likened<br/>
to those of Hebrew women of old, very Madonnas in form<br/>
and figure; beside them Copts, English tourists with<br/>
their exterior so destructive of all poetry, Mohammedan<br/>
country people, crippled beggars, and an indescribable<br/>
medley from the very ends of the earth-all these idly<br/>
loitering in the streets and looking curiously at us.<br/>
<br/>
The procession stood drawn up, awaiting our arrival,<br/>
at the point from which one first beholds Jerusalem.<br/>
Every one knelt to pray with bared head. The holy<br/>
Zion, with its ancient walls, its grey white circular houses,<br/>
the cupolas of the Church of the Sepulchre, and the great<br/>
Mosque of Omar were all before us<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
