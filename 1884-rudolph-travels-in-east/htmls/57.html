climbs the accommodation ladder, and after brief greeting<br/>
takes his place on the steering bridge, his boat being taken<br/>
in tow. We proceed towards the narrow rocky channel by<br/>
which the Old Port is reached.<br/>
<br/>
On the right the half-ruined castle of Said <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pasha-elMek </span>attracts our attention by its interesting architecture.<br/>
Several batteries and some extensive palm plantations follow, and bending round a well-built breakwater we enter the<br/>
harbour, and a splendid view of the whole city opens on us.<br/>
<br/>
Were it not for the .minarets and some large buildings<br/>
in Arab style which speak of the East, one might easily<br/>

<span style="color: #0000FF;">Czardas</span>, while from the yacht we heard the modern<br/>
melody of the "Hymn of the Khedive."<br/>
<br/>
Several steamers of the Austrian Lloyd's were dressed<br/>
in gala colours. The harbour was full of vessels all dressed.<br/>
The standard of the Turkish Empire, the white half-moon<br/>
on a blood-red field, dipped to salute us.<br/>
<br/>
The expanse of waters was thronged with boats filled<br/>
with Arabs of all classes, rich and poor; but all, no matter<br/>
of what rank, in most picturesque draperies and full of<br/>
