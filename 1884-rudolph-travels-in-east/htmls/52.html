<span>18 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

distance was too great, and I did not fire. Thereupon<br/>
the dogs and the priest rushed in wild leaps after the noble<br/>
prey. The hare was naturally the quickest, and soon disappeared. A hare plays, thanks to its great rarity, an<br/>
important part in Zante; and the poor priest returned to<br/>
me panting and declaiming in Greek.<br/>
<br/>
When we reached the convent it was late in the afternoon, and we hastened to our carriages. The long drive<br/>
was fine but chilly, and it was evening before we reached<br/>
the Miramar. We took leave of Zante, as favourable<br/>
reports allowed of our departure being fixed for the<br/>
morning. The island showed itself beautiful to the last<br/>
in the clear moonshine.<br/>
<br/>
The morning of the 16th brought us good weather and<br/>
a glassy sea. At four <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>we were in motion. We glided<br/>
past lovely scenes. The snow-clad mountains of Arcadia<br/>
and Messenia reminded me of the mountains on the north<br/>
coast of Spain. The contrast of white snowfields with<br/>
the deep blue sky above them was most striking. The<br/>
further south we came, the lighter in colour, and apparently<br/>
the less rocky, grew the mountains. One lofty stretch<br/>
of hills wore the yellowish airy hue of the bare desert<br/>
mountains of the Iberian peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
We passed N <span style="color: #ff0000;">avarino</span>, and later on saw the jagged <span style="color: #0000FF;">outlines </span>of Cape Matapan. Soon after followed the rocky<br/>
islets of Arigo and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arigetto</span>. In the afternoon the<br/>
mountains of Candia appeared on the horizon, and in the<br/>
evening we passed the western point of this large and<br/>
beautiful island. By moonlight we saw the dim and misty<br/>
contours of the Cretan mountains. We spent <span style="color: #0000FF;">delightful<br/>
