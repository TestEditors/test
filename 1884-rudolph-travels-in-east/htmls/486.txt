<span>326 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

ascetics of the first centuries. The traveller involuntarily<br/>
fancies himself carried back to the days of the hermits of<br/>
Mount Athos and other holy places at the dawn of Christendom, where in the far East pious men who have since<br/>
been canonized lived in ceaseless prayer in caves and dens.<br/>
<br/>
Such was the early Christian Church. It was Eastern,<br/>
and the Mar-Saba of our day has kept itself pure and<br/>
uncontaminated at the level of those pious hermits of the<br/>
third and fourth centuries. It is no convent according to<br/>
European ideas, but a settlement of hermits, a group of<br/>
solitaries living independently, but gathered into a narrow<br/>
space by common dangers.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">either </span>learning nor luxury have place on this mountain, nothing but prayer; daily the same continuous worship,<br/>
complete self-annihilation and mortification. A child of<br/>
the nineteenth century, of purely Western training, cannot<br/>
conceive of such a life. Only the East could produce the<br/>
fanaticism which still holds its ground there<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The rabbis,<br/>
who wail at the wall of the temple; the dervishes, who<br/>
pass their whole lives in squatting or turning or mutilating<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">themselves-in </span>what do they differ P The substance is the<br/>
same; the form alone is changed.<br/>
<br/>
The ascetics of Mar-Saba eat only bread and vegetables. The loud bell of the convent calls the hermits<br/>
daily to the church to united prayer. N <span style="color: #ff0000;">ightly </span>at the twelfth<br/>
hour they celebrate high Mass, and the old Greek chants<br/>
do not cease till morning breaks. I found some Russians<br/>
among the brothers, Transylvanians, Wallachians, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sclavonians</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Servians</span>, and Bulgarians, but by far the most were<br/>
Greeks from Europe and Asia Minor<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
