<span>VISIT TO THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">TOMBS </span>OF THE KINGS. 163<br/>

of jackals some Englishmen came, who looked at me<br/>
with astonishment, but soon went on their way.<br/>
<br/>
When it had grown quite dark a big bird swooped<br/>
down on the pond like a phantom. I fired at it on the<br/>
chance of hitting, and found a grey heron lying dead on<br/>
the bank. After that I left my place and rode back to<br/>
Luxor. The other gentlemen had returned without any<br/>
game.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Next </span>morning early we rowed to the opposite Libyan<br/>
shore, in order to make the distant and very interesting<br/>
excursion to the kings' tombs. We rode on asses, at first<br/>
across a fertile plain. Fellaheen were toiling industriously<br/>
in the fields; carrion <span style="color: #ff0000;">vultures </span>sat in numbers beside the<br/>
scattered mud cottages; camels, long-eared goats, buffaloes,<br/>
asses, and sheep browsed on the yellowish pastures. The<br/>
road led past some pools, with water still remaining in<br/>
them from the time of the inundation. We crossed a<br/>
shallow and very sandy arm of the Nile to a poor <span style="color: #0000FF;">little<br/>
</span>village, where the last palms and shrubs gave place to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>desolate sand of the desert. The foot of the lofty<br/>
mountains was soon reached, and a narrow valley shut in<br/>
by steep slopes and cliffs opened before us. The bridlepath at the bottom leads to the kings' tombs, and the<br/>
gentlemen took this way.<br/>
<br/>
The Grand Duke and I resolved to proceed to the same<br/>
spot by a short cut across the mountain. Guided by an<br/>
Arab, known in the neighbourhood as an excellent sportsman, we climbed over some hills of sand and rubble, and<br/>
began the actual ascent beyond them.<br/>

A narrow path wound upward along the cliffs, among<br/>
