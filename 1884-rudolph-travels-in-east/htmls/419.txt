</span>vegetation vanish more and more completely, and a dreary<br/>
stony desert begins-the accursed land. One cannot<br/>
divest one's self of this feeling. A peculiar, sad, but at<br/>
the same time majestic, character seems to belong to the<br/>
whole country, and strange and mystic emotions take<br/>
possession of each traveller.<br/>

the crucifix on high and inciting the knight to heroic<br/>
deeds; the second, a fellow-countryman, a Bohemian who<br/>

with me, for the first time, perchance, for years, in his<br/>
mother tongue. Both monks greeted us most heartily<br/>
and fell into our procession. The Franciscans in the<br/>
Holy Land are literally the representatives of the Latin<br/>
Church. Brave combatants for their faith, they defend<br/>
in constant strife the privileges of the rite as against<br/>
other forms and creeds.<br/>
<br/>
We have climbed the hill-the bare desolate plateau<br/>
of Jerusalem stretches before us, and in the distance rise<br/>
the blue-grey mountains of the Valley of the Jordan.<br/>
Yellow grey is the pervading tone of the landscape,<br/>

visible-the great mass of the Russian church with its<br/>
