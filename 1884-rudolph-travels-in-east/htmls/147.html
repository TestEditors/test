<span>WE CAPTURE THE PREV. <span style="color: #ff0000;">87<br/>

<br/>
</span>this cleft as well as we could, and I sounded with a pole<br/>
the interior of the cover. When I <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew </span>the stake<br/>
it had some grey lynx-hairs on it. Looking cautiously in,<br/>
we saw the green eyes of the lynx sparkling. Hereupon<br/>
I drove the stake in as far as I could towards the beast,<br/>
and in a few moments felt that the soft body disappeared.<br/>
The hunt underground was now perceptible, and the<br/>
scuffle of the escaping lynx with the dogs.<br/>
<br/>
In a few seconds more the grey fellow sprang with<br/>
long leaps from the funnel by which the Grand Duke<br/>
stood. A <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-directed </span>shot received him there. Half<br/>
staggering, half dragging himself along, the severely<br/>
wounded creature reached shelter under a big rock<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>Luckily the brave dogs held the lynx by his hind quarters,<br/>
and so Prince Taxis succeeded, by creeping under the<br/>
rock, in giving him a thrust with his hunting knife. A<br/>
handsome but much weaker specimen, a female, not<br/>
nearly so big and powerful as the buck killed by me, lay<br/>
before us.<br/>
<br/>
After this triumph we renounced further search and<br/>
went, with the weary and more or less injured dogs,<br/>
back to our camp.<br/>
<br/>
The weather had grown worse during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">forenoon</span>.<br/>
A light grey cloud covered the whole sky, and fine rain<br/>
fell between whiles, which in these regions is a most rare<br/>
occurrence. The north wind increased, and instead of the<br/>
scorching heat of the previous day came coolness which<br/>
the contrast made very perceptible. The water broke in<br/>
high waves, and the watermen declared that it was impossible under these circumstances to leave the island.<br/>
