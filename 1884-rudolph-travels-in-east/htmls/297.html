<br/>
The deepest stillness prevailed in the monotonous<br/>
country round. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">mountains </span>rose in dim <span style="color: #ff0000;">-outlif1e</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">.and<br/>
</span>the yellow desert seemed interminable. I heard the<br/>
stealthy prowl of the jackal several times, and saw shadows<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Hit </span>by, and once even distinguished the form of a wolf;<br/>
but the much-wished-for <span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena </span>did not come,<br/>
<br/>
The right hour for this timid beast is the first after<br/>
midnight; but on this occasion also sleep so overcame me<br/>
that by eleven o'clock I was unable longer to resist it. I<br/>
left the ambush.<span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>The Arab let me go with a reproachful<br/>
look, and resolved to wait, armed with his gun, for the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">hyama</span>.<br/>
<br/>
A long but lovely ride lay before me. The moonlit<br/>
nights of Egypt belong to the most bewitching, memories<br/>
which I have brought with me from the glorious land of<br/>
the Pharaohs. The Colossi of Memnon stood ghost-like<br/>
and grand by night in the dark green of the landscape.<br/>
Near the Nile a wolf ran across a few steps in front of me;<br/>
unluckily my gun was not loaded. It was very late when.<br/>
I reached the steamer and my much-desired rest.<br/>
<br/>
Early on the 12th, we all rode the same way to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Medinet-Habu</span>. Long rows of storks stood on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sandbanks </span>and in the water-pools; and I shot snipe and sandpipers while mounted on my donkey.<br/>
<br/>
After an hour's ride we reached the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">MedinetHabu</span>, where the Arab hunter was already waiting to tell<br/>
us that he had happily missed the <span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena </span>about one <span style="color: #ff0000;">o'cl6ck<br/>
</span>at night. I did not believe him, and resolved to look at<br/>
the spot myself, and also to bestow my attention on <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>vultures, which, according to the report of the Arab, were<br/>
assembled there in numbers.<br/>
<br/>
