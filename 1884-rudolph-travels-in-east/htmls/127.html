<br/>
Now came the exciting moment, when the first stayed<br/>
his pinions and dropped into the ravine. At this signal all<br/>
the others did the same, and, like an avalanche of stones,<br/>
vulture after vulture came tumbling down. The last had<br/>
scarcely reached the goal when we saw smoke rise from<br/>
the battery above. Speedy dispersion and wild confusion<br/>
among the group of huge birds were the first effects of<br/>

waiting in the valley, and so the laborious and noisome<br/>
task devolved on the Grand Duke and me of carrying the<br/>
heavy booty down the steep path on our backs.<br/>
<br/>
When we reached the quarry it was afternoon, and the<br/>
other gentlemen, who had placed a carcase by a ruined<br/>
mosque and tombs on the plateau of the Mokattam mountains, had long since returned. Their spoil consisted of<br/>
