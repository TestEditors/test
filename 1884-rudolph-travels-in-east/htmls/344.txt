<span>216 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

low over the water, disappeared from our sight behind the<br/>
islands.<br/>
<br/>
Much disappointed, we continued our voyage to a<br/>
long island with a large white sand-bank; some smaller<br/>
game was shot on the way. Our purpose now was to seek<br/>
suitable points for our evening stations, for the water-fowl<br/>
had begun already gradually to assemble.<br/>
<br/>
Unluckily this very suitable looking island was already<br/>
occupied. An old and very ragged bird-catcher sat in a<br/>
hut built out of small branches. His child crouched beside<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">him-an </span>urchin covered over with <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ries</span>, gnats, and every<br/>
description of vermin. He had connected himself by cords<br/>

<br/>
A poor blind and most melancholy looking pelican was<br/>
tied to a stake, as decoy bird, and likewise some ten or<br/>
twelve blinded cormorants. It seemed indeed to be a<br/>
most suitable spot, for the ground was covered to such an<br/>
extent with putrefying fish, guano, and feathers, that a<br/>
European could not long have held out there. The poor<br/>
bird-catcher appeared to be no way pleased at our visit, and<br/>
muttered some grumbling words into his shaggy beard.<br/>
<br/>
We did not incommode him long, but rowed quickly<br/>
off to a long narrow island which lay opposite. On arriving,<br/>
different points were assigned to each of us. The thick<br/>
bushes afforded capital cover, and there was soon complete<br/>
stillness on the island. The flight of birds began. Cormorants, <span style="color: #0000FF;">spoonbills</span>, some heron, several moor-buzzards, and<br/>
small shore birds of various kinds came by, but mostly too<br/>
far off. A few were shot, but on the whole the shooting<br/>
was not a success. Flamingoes, alone or in parties of as<br/>
