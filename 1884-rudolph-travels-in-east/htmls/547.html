<br/>
powerful grey-bearded man with a leather-thonged whip<br/>
in his hand, as sign of authority, rode in front to show the<br/>
most direct way. It was a glorious gallop along the steppe,<br/>
across country, pursued by the great fire, a spectacle<br/>
which the vastness of other continents can seldom rival.<br/>
A wild boar, fleeing like ourselves from the fire, rushed<br/>
past my horse at the distance of but a few paces.<br/>
<br/>
A long hand gallop brought us quickly across the<br/>
steppe and through a <span style="color: #ff0000;">region'overgrown </span>with tall <span style="color: #ff0000;">longthorned </span>thistles which distressed both us and the horses.<br/>
At the end of two hours the character of the country began<br/>
to change. The valley grew broader, and low green hills<br/>
rose in its midst, covered with bushes and dwarf oak. To<br/>
the north the view was closed in by fine mountains: the<br/>
spurs of Carmel, the mountains round Nazareth, the lofty<br/>
Tabor with its distinctive outline, the Anti-Lebanon and<br/>
the snow-clad Hermon, the mountains of the Sea of<br/>
Gennesareth (the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tabariye </span>of the Arabs)<span style="color: #ff0000;">'</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>and to the east<br/>
the heights of Djebel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Adjhtm </span>could all be distinguished,<br/>
thrown up in effective light. Our way led past a<br/>
little Bedouin burying-ground. Two wonderful ancient<br/>
sycamores gave the gloomy spot a still more dismal<br/>
aspect.<br/>
<br/>
We gradually approached the goal of our day's journey,<br/>
the village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Baishn</span>. The famous well region of this place<br/>
extends round it in a wide circle. In all directions small<br/>
watercourses break forth from the plateau, and thick low<br/>
bushes, tall reed grass, morass, and marshy places fill the<br/>
neighbourhood. The cry of the blackcock, which is<br/>
found here in immense quantities, is heard on all sides.<br/>
