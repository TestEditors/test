ideals, and the grandest women of whom we read in the<br/>
New Testament, walk <span style="color: #0000FF;">about</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>here in flesh and blood. The<br/>
astonished traveller fancies himself transported in a dream<br/>
to the days of the Saviour, when Mary brought forth the<br/>
God-man in a poor stable, and when the wise men of the<br/>
East, following the star, came from the Valley of the Jordan,<br/>
where their free nomad kingdoms existed then as they<br/>
exist now.<br/>
<br/>
Bethlehem and its holy places are exactly reproduced<br/>
in the cradle scenes which we see in the pictures of pious<br/>
painters of the Middle Ages, and the painted toys which<br/>
are now given to children at Christmas. The town is<br/>
chiefly inhabited by Christians, and of five thousand souls<br/>
only three hundred are Moslems.<br/>
<br/>
We came out of the street into a square surrounded by<br/>
Oriental houses, on one side of which stands the great<br/>
Church of the Virgin, with the buildings pertaining to it.<br/>
The most sacred places are under one roof, and belong to<br/>
the Latins, Greeks, and Armenians in common. All three<br/>
sects have their respective convents communicating with<br/>
the church.<br/>
<br/>
The custode of Terra Santa awaited us at the great gate<br/>
with some of his Franciscans, and the square was crowded<br/>
with people. Innumerable petitions were handed to us in<br/>
the space of a few minutes. The church is very ancient<br/>
and handsome, of Byzantine origin, and fairly preserved<br/>
from the time of the Emperor Constantine, who built it.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Inside</span>, one is surprised at the nooks which have been added<br/>
in the course of time, and the many low, narrow doors<br/>
through which one can scarcely squeeze; their purpose is<br/>
<br/>
