</span>Some friendly priests invited us in to take luncheon<br/>
in the convent. When we inquired about sport in their<br/>
parts, the godly men at once proposed that we should course<br/>
a hare. When luncheon was over we started under the<br/>
guidance of the youngest priest, who wore a short frock,<br/>
broad blue trousers, and slippers. His head was adorned<br/>
with the priestly biretta, and he carried a long gun. Two<br/>
dogs, far removed from sporting breed, and a peasant<br/>
followed him.<br/>
<br/>
We mounted <span style="color: #0000FF;">for </span>more than an hour through a gloomy<br/>
ravine-right and left high hill slopes excluding any view;<br/>
nothing but smooth, dazzling white stones, the rocks<br/>
fringed with a narrow strip of dark evergreen shrubs. The<br/>
whole had the sunburnt character of so many mountain<br/>
districts of the South, such as those of Dalmatia and, Spain<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
<br/>
</span>The dogs snuffed about among the <span style="color: #0000FF;">stones</span>, and the<br/>
priest with much energy sprang from rock to rock, -with<br/>
loaded gun at full cock, but nothing stirred. High aloft<br/>
some imperial eagles soared in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">air.. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I<br/>
<br/>
</span>At last we reached the ridge of the mountain. "A fine<br/>
view of the sea opened on us, and we could see far along<br/>
the mountain plateau, with its confusion of stones, rocks,<br/>
peaks, and points.<br/>
<br/>
We rested for about a quarter of an hour. We heard<br/>
several <span style="color: #0000FF;">shots </span>almost at hand, and soon some peasants<br/>
appeared with their guns. They had missed one" of the<br/>
few hares of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">island</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">I </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>On our way back I kept along the height, taking the<br/>
shortest way to the convent. Suddenly a small hare (probably <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lamas </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Medite1watteui1 </span>ran out in front of me. The<br/>
