<span>THE RISE OF CAIRO. 43<br/>

<br/>
and when, under Caliph <span style="color: #ff0000;">Othmén</span>, Arabians settled in the<br/>
valley of the Nile, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostét </span>became the centre of government.<br/>
A school of learning was already in existence there when<br/>
Caliph <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mtm </span>(<span style="color: #ff0000;">8r3-833</span>), the son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hartin </span>al-Raschid,<br/>
visited Egypt. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostht </span>became still more prosperous under<br/>
the Governor Ahmed ibn <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tultin</span>, who made himself Sultan<br/>
of Egypt, and his building-loving successors. Scarcely a<br/>
hundred years later, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fostéit </span>lost its position as capital, when<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Djéhar</span>, general of Sultan Muizz, who had become ruler of<br/>
Maghreb (Tunis), conquered <span style="color: #ff0000;">Fosttt </span>in the name of his<br/>
master, and founded a new capital not far from the old<br/>
town. In this new town Muizz took up his abode, and<br/>
called it <span style="color: #ff0000;">Masr-el-kthira</span>.<br/>
<br/>
Cairo thus became the capital of the empire of the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Fétimee </span>Caliphs, and advanced rapidly.<br/>
<br/>
Muizz, son and successor of Aziz <span style="color: #ff0000;">Billt1h</span>, founded the<br/>
university, el-Azhar. Under his successor, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Hakim</span>, the town<br/>
extended to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bhb-en-Nasr </span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Batb-el-Futtih</span>, the old gates<br/>
of which we shall speak by-and-by. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Saltheddin<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Eyubide</span>, who built the citadel and surrounded Cairo with<br/>
walls, bestowed no less care on the city than the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Feitimee<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Caliphs </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">had </span>done. Several <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>Mameluke Sultans, notably<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Kalatin</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Aschref-Chalil</span>, Hassan, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barkilk</span>, Kait-Bey and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">El-GMri</span>, adorned the town with handsome buildings, while<br/>
the inhabitants, it is true, suffered from the unbridled<br/>
tyranny of the greedy, plundering Mamelukes. In 1517,<br/>
the Osman Sultan, Selim I., put an abrupt end to the<br/>
further growth of Cairo. After the battle of Heliopolis, he<br/>
took Cairo by storm. The last of the Mameluke Sultans,<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tiims1n-Bey</span>, was hung at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Btb-es-Zuwtle</span>, April 15th, 1517,<br/>
