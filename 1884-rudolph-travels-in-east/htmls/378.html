<span>242 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Lake, a monument of Ramses II. is found near <span style="color: #0000FF;">Mas-Chile</span>,<br/>
together with sphinxes, inscribed stones, and the remains<br/>
of old brick buildings. Lesseps and the greater number of<br/>
scholars have identified this site with that of the town<br/>
Ramses of the Scriptures; and the name of Ramses has for<br/>
this reason been given to the railway station.<br/>
<br/>
Leaving the Wadi the line passes to the terminal station<br/>
of Ismailia. Its further course across the desert along the<br/>
western shore of the Bitter Lakes, both northern and<br/>
southern, affords some interest from the view across their<br/>
shining blue waters, and to the westward by the sight of<br/>
the picturesquely shaped Mount <span style="color: #ff0000;">Geneffe</span>, whose quarries,<br/>
especially in parts where the stone is almost of the quality<br/>
of marble, are extensively worked at the present day. At<br/>
last we catch sight of the dark and imposing Mount Ataka,<br/>
and soon after the azure blue mirror of the sea tells that we<br/>
approach the <span style="color: #0000FF;">part </span>of Suez.<br/>
<br/>
One is surprised as one enters the station by the sight<br/>
of the harbour alive with the ships of all nations, among<br/>
which the Indiamen claim the first place, both in size and<br/>
equipment. The town, which we reached late in the<br/>
afternoon, is tasteless and unimportant; its wretched hotels<br/>
and the private houses of the consuls, in no style at all, give<br/>
it a Western character; nordo the numerous wharves and<br/>
harbour buildings enhance its beauty.<br/>
<br/>
The great historic importance of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">scene </span>alone gives<br/>
it real interest, and lends a charm to the smooth surface of<br/>
the Red Sea, and the picturesque but sad and gloomy coast<br/>
which surrounds it. We were tired by the hot journey,<br/>
and went direct to our hotel to dine.<br/>
