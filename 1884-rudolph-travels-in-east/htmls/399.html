</span>SHOOTING A LOCUST. 259<br/>

<br/>
but as the heat was very great and our chances few, we set<br/>
off on our return to the railway-station. In order to display<br/>
the skill of the falcon, the sheik let his noble comrade <span style="color: #0000FF;">fly </span>at<br/>
a pigeon, which in a few seconds fell to the ground, struck<br/>
with deadly force by the falcon's claw.<br/>
<br/>
We soon reached the station, and after a frugal breakfast in the carriages some of the party went back to<br/>
Ismailia, while the other gentlemen accompanied me on<br/>
board a small steamer to make a trip to the Sweet-water<br/>
Canal. We halted at a ruinous old house, and crossed the<br/>
sand dunes to a strip of marsh which, closely bounded by<br/>
the desert, runs parallel to the canal up to the Crocodile<br/>
Lake near Ismailia.<br/>
<br/>
One of the French gentlemen, a most pleasant man<br/>
and ardent sportsman, guided us into this hunting-field, in<br/>
which he had often pursued noble game. In the first moor<br/>
we found the beautiful African golden rail, which was quite<br/>
new to us, and shot a considerable number of them within<br/>
a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
On the wetter ground there were many snipe and<br/>
several kinds <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>marsh and water runners; ducks, too,<br/>
and spurred Plover; quails were put up in the long grass;<br/>
the locusts were also very interesting, the biggest of their<br/>
kind that I have ever seen. These insects flew up with a<br/>
loud humming when one was still at some distance, so that<br/>
in order to examine one of them near I was obliged to<br/>
shoot it like a quail-a strange shot, verily!<br/>
<br/>
In the narrow valley, bounded by the desert, the sun<br/>
burnt fearfully, drawing mephitic vapours from the marsh.<br/>
After several hours of fatiguing sport we returned, richly<br/>
