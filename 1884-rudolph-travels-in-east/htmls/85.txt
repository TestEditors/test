<br/>
We reached the doors of the ancient edifice through a<br/>
narrow alley, available only for foot-passengers.<br/>
<br/>
The adjoining buildings are inhabited by Christians,<br/>
chiefly Copts; and, in course of time, a Christian colony has<br/>
gathered around the so-called "House of the Christians."<br/>
<br/>
Some clergy, with dark complexions, long beards, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">strorygly </span>marked Jewish features, in their full-plaited black<br/>
garments, so different from those of all other confessions,<br/>
awaited us, with their bishop at their head.<br/>
<br/>
The Coptic religion, like everything else in the East,<br/>
has remained unchanged in usages, customs, liturgy, and<br/>
vestments. As the first Christians who brought the faith<br/>
from Asia to Africa read Mass, went through ceremonies, or<br/>
preached, so do their successors, the Copts of the present<br/>
day. Their ritual never having come in contact with that<br/>
of the West, has maintained itself pure and incorrupt; and<br/>
we see in the Egyptian Copts the faithful image of the<br/>
early days of Christendom. <span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">hey </span>are the representatives<br/>
of our faith in <span style="color: #0000FF;">North-Eastern </span>Africa; but their diffusion<br/>
extends far into the interior of the Dark Continent.<br/>
<br/>
They belong by race to the people among whom they<br/>
live; and though surrounded by the stormy and victorious<br/>
advance of Islam, this little colony of ancient Christians,<br/>
small as compared with the opposing creed, has been able<br/>
to maintain its existence and purest traditions intact to the<br/>
present day.<br/>
<br/>
We saw among the priests and choir-boys the swarthy<br/>
or dark brown faces of the genuine African. In the<br/>
simple, poorly appointed church were many worshippers,<br/>
chiefly Copts, but some of them the followers of other<br/>
