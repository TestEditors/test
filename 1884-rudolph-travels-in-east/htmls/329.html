<br/>
This garden is an extraordinary boon to the Cairenes,<br/>
especially in the hot part of the year. It is beautifully<br/>
laid out and well kept, and luxuriant and blooming by<br/>
favour of the climate. Its moment of greatest perfection<br/>
is at the full moon; and yet we were not satisfied. The<br/>
moonlight of Cairo seemed to us pale and dim compared<br/>
with that of glorious Assuan.<br/>
<br/>
From the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekiy√© </span>Garden we made a round through<br/>
the old Arab quarter. We had unwittingly chosen a very<br/>
favourable evening. The.Moslems were celebrating the<br/>
feast of the great El-Hossein, and thus we enjoyed, in<br/>
the streets near the mosque dedicated to him, the very<br/>
striking sight of an Oriental popular festival at night.<br/>
<br/>
Great crowds moved up and down in the narrow streets.<br/>
The shops and Arab coffee-houses were open, and lighted<br/>
lamps and candelabra were fastened to the houses, and<br/>
bright carpets stretched across the streets. Glass <span style="color: #0000FF;">lustres</span>,<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">lighted</span>, hung from coloured cords over the middle of the<br/>
streets, and all the houses were more or less <span style="color: #0000FF;">brilliantly'<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">decorated </span>according to the wealth of their owners. Everything was gay with light, colour, and the most incredible<br/>
variety of trifles.<br/>
<br/>
Moslems of every class and trade elbowed each other;<br/>
country folk in their blue shirts, screaming water-carriers,<br/>
wailing cripples and beggars, Bedouins in white burnous,<br/>
portly merchants, fine gentlemen in gay and <span style="color: #ff0000;">flowing </span>apparel<br/>
with green turbans on their heads, in token of descent from<br/>
the Prophet, soldiers and dealers of all kinds-all moving<br/>
together towards the mosque, which was bright with all its<br/>
lights streaming from the widely opened door.<br/>
