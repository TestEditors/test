<br/>
<br/>
</span>We stopped a passing engine and got into the empty<br/>
luggage van attached to it. In this way we reached<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Abuskar </span>very quickly. Our Arabs rode full swing after us<br/>
between the rails, and followed with incredible <span style="color: #0000FF;">celerity</span>.<br/>
<br/>
As we had some spare time, we resolved that we would<br/>
again, by way of experiment, beat the sugar-cane field which<br/>
we had hunted on the first day. We got together as many<br/>
drivers as we could collect, and surrounded the field.<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">beating </span>had scarcely begun, when a wolf broke out<br/>
beside one of the guns who was standing at the corner.<br/>
He could not fire while the wolf was near him, on account<br/>
of the country people, and when he discharged both barrels,<br/>
the wolf was already too far off.<br/>
<br/>
A few seconds later, another gentleman shot an exceedingly fine wolf, the biggest of all which we had hitherto<br/>
killed, at the moment when he was going to double at the<br/>
road that crossed the field. Before the <span style="color: #0000FF;">heaters </span>came out,<br/>
two other guns got each of them a wolf, and a <span style="color: #ff0000;">woodcock</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
</span>was missed.<br/>
<br/>
We now left the field, which, at the end of three days,<br/>
gave us a better yield than at our first hunt. At the<br/>
station, the show of six wolves shot in one day was made,<br/>
and, had we captured all that were wounded, our results<br/>
would have been quite extraordinary.<br/>
<br/>
On the whole, we had every reason to be satisfied with<br/>
the success of our four and a half days' hunting excursion<br/>
in the oasis of Fayum.<br/>
<br/>
Two lynx, seven wolves, two ichneumon, two desert<br/>
hares, four pelicans, two river eagles, one carrion vulture,<br/>
one African eagle buzzard and one hundred and seventy<br/>
<br/>
