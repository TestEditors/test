<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Pilabes</span>), a famous town, especially in the Middle Ages,<br/>
which was the residence of the Arabian governors of the<br/>
eastern division of the Delta.. Then comes Zagazig, a<br/>
large place, known for its commercial activity, where<br/>
many Europeans and Levantines have settled; near it is a<br/>
mighty hill of ruins called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-Basta</span>, beneath which have<br/>
lain for centuries the last remains of the temples and houses<br/>
of the town of Bubastis, so celebrated in antiquity (old<br/>
Egyptian Pi-bast, <span style="color: #0000FF;">f.e</span>. house or abode of the goddess <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>Bast,"<br/>
in Hebrew <span style="color: #ff0000;">Phi-beseth</span>). Here the goddess above named<br/>
was worshipped in a vast and splendid temple. Her images<br/>
in stone and bronze are still dug in quantities out of the<br/>
ruins. She is represented as a slender and young woman,<br/>
who bears a sistrum in one hand and a basket in the other,<br/>
and instead of a woman's head she has that of a cat,<br/>
cats being consecrated to her. In the inscriptions she is<br/>
often described as the local form of the peace and health<br/>
bringing goddess Isis.<br/>
<br/>
Eastward from the town of Bubastis (which was the<br/>
capital of the province called after it, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bubastites</span>) lay in<br/>
ancient times the southern half of the adjoining province of<br/>
Arabia, of which we possess but few records in the classical<br/>
writers of antiquity. It is the land to which the name of<br/>
Goshen is given in Holy Scripture.<br/>
<br/>
The railway crosses this territory in a straight line to<br/>
the east, and follows the Sweet-water Canal into Wadi<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Ttimilat</span>. At the entrance to this last, at <span style="color: #0000FF;">TelI-abu-Soliman</span>,<br/>
are the ruins of the town of Pithom or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Patumos</span>, at which<br/>
the Israelites before the exodus were compelled to labour<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
