<span>238 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
in honour <span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>religious festival, and we were glad, after our<br/>
interesting but exciting day, to <span style="color: #ff0000;">betake </span>ourselves to rest.<br/>
<br/>
I drove on the morning of the 23rd to the tombs of the<br/>
Caliphs. Where the carriage-road ends, at the last house,<br/>
we mounted on donkeys, and riding through the tombs soon<br/>
reached the foot of the high cliffs of the Mokattam<br/>
mountain. We took the same path as some weeks before.<br/>
The cliff was climbed, and in a short time we were crouched<br/>
in a narrow and most inconvenient ambush.<br/>
<br/>
At the end of three long and perfectly eventless hours<br/>
some kites and carrion vultures appeared. They had just<br/>
begun their meal when I heard the heavy flap of the wings<br/>
of a great bird. The lesser guests scattered forthwith in<br/>
alarm, and a large white-headed vulture lighted with <span style="color: #ff0000;">halfopened </span>wings on the back of the ass, and began his breakfast without delay.<br/>
<br/>
Without a moment's pause I laid him low with a shot,<br/>
and creeping out of the cave shouldered my heavy booty,<br/>
and climbed down the rocks, cliffs, and heaps of stones to<br/>
the place where the servants and the asses waited. By<br/>
noon we were at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kasr-en-Nusha </span>once more.<br/>
<br/>
After breakfast and a short rest the Grand Duke and I<br/>
resolved to pay a visit to the Shubra garden. Taking our<br/>
guns we got into one of the droskies of the country, and<br/>
drove through the magnificent Shubra Avenue to the high<br/>
garden wall. A great piece of ground is enclosed, and the<br/>
castle stands among lofty trees and thick shrubs of almost<br/>
tropical growth; it is surrounded by ponds, kiosks, and<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Rower-beds</span>. A considerable space is given to <span style="color: #ff0000;">kitchengardens</span>, orange-groves, and even green corn. The<br/>
