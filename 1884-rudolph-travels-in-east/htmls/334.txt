decay-a process likely, from the hasty and reckless mode<br/>
of building them, to go on pretty quickly.<br/>
<br/>
We visited every corner of the gardens and houses,<br/>
and .then drove to the Pyramids of Gizeh. The heat was<br/>
oppressive, and a strong wind blew the sand of the<br/>
desert into nose and eyes; so we were glad when the long<br/>
road along the dyke was left behind, and we reached the<br/>
foot of these giant structures.<br/>
<br/>
The purpose of this second visit was a jackal hunt,<br/>
and the ascent of the great Cheops Pyramid. Some Arabs<br/>
began at once to search the venerable piles. Only two<br/>
jackals were found: the Grand Duke killed the one, and I<br/>
fired at the other, but from too great a distance, and the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">wounded.beast </span>dragged itself painfully <span style="color: #0000FF;">off </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">into </span>the desert.<br/>
<br/>
The third small Pyramid was quite empty, and so we<br/>
were soon at liberty to address ourselves to the ascent<br/>
of the huge mountain of stone. My companions accomplished the toilsome but not perilous task in twenty<br/>
minutes. I wished to give the Arabs who crowd round<br/>
the tourists, and hoist them from step to step, a little<br/>
brisk exercise, and jumping from stone to stone I reached<br/>
the very summit in nine minutes. From the small platform there one obtains a fine view over the green Valley<br/>
of the Nile, the wide-stretching fertile plain of Lower<br/>
Egypt, the orange-coloured deserts on both sides, and<br/>
the beautiful town of Cairo, with its sea of houses and<br/>
its high minarets.<br/>
<br/>
The sun was declining. In the yellow mist of the<br/>
heated atmosphere, thick with whirling sand, its disc<br/>
looked like a fiery ball slowly disappearing in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Libyan<br/>
