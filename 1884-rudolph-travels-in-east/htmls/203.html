</span>Tantare. This well-preserved sanctuary, which was dedicated to the goddess Hathor, the Venus of the Egyptians,<br/>
dates from the latest age of the Ptolemies and the first of the<br/>
rule of the Roman emperors over Egypt. Its importance<br/>
lies in the knowledge it <span style="color: #0000FF;">affords </span>of the plan and of the<br/>
separate parts of an ancient Egyptian temple of great<br/>
extent.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span>" If we take the similar and even more completely <span style="color: #ff0000;">carriedout </span>design of the Temple of Edfu to our aid, we find that<br/>
the separate parts come in the following <span style="color: #0000FF;">order'<br/>
</span>"<span style="color: #ff0000;">1</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Two tower-like wings in front of the temple, with the<br/>
chief entrance or portal between them. Two obelisks and<br/>
the colossal statue of the royal founder to the right and left<br/>
of the gate made an imposing foreground in front of the<br/>
vast Bat mass of the two wings.<br/>
<br/>
"2. The open court, with a pillared corridor-the socalled peristyle.<br/>
<br/>
"3. The vestibule, with its half-open <span style="color: #0000FF;">facade </span>in front,.<br/>
whose characters the temples of Dendera very distinctly<br/>
exhibit. Astronomical pictures and suitable inscriptions<br/>
adorn the ceilings of this chamber.<br/>
<br/>
"4. The banquet hall, with chambers to the right and left.<br/>
<br/>
"5. The hall of sacrifice, with side rooms. <span style="color: #0000FF;">_<br/>
<br/>
</span>"6. The central room, also with small rooms.<br/>
<br/>
"7. The adytum, or holiest of holies, stood in the<br/>
middle of the innermost'part of the temple, like a temple<br/>
within a temple. Within it was a stone chapel containing<br/>
the image of the deity of the shrine, and also the consecrated boats, in which the images of the gods were<br/>
home on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">shdulders </span>of the priests at the great festi<br/>
