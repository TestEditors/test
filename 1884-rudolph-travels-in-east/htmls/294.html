<span>I78 TRAVELS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
huntsmen had persuaded me to visit a station near <span style="color: #ff0000;">MedinetHabu </span>in the evening, in quest of beasts of prey. Followed<br/>
by my huntsman, therefore, I rode off after dinner, and once<br/>
more took the long way across the tilled land and past the<br/>
Colossus, to the wretched village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">MSlinet-Habu</span>, which<br/>
consists solely of mud-huts. A tolerably broad desert plain,<br/>
which separates the cultivated land from the foot of the<br/>
mountains, opens immediately behind this <span style="color: #0000FF;">village<br/>
<br/>
</span>Some much-trodden tracks, marked by the footprints<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">hyzenas</span>, wolves, and jackals, connect the mountain with<br/>
the level sporting ground below<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>On such a track I hid<br/>
behind some large stones. The sun was setting; the sand<br/>
of the desert, the rocks of the mountains, the ruins, the<br/>
palms, and the villages of the plain were flooded with the<br/>
richest colours. A large yellow-brown Pharaoh-owl took<br/>
its noiseless <span style="color: #0000FF;">Right </span>from its dark hiding-place in search of<br/>
prey. Soon after a jackal appeared, keeping the beaten<br/>
track very closely.<br/>
<br/>
I shot <span style="color: #ff0000;">at</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span>beast as it trotted carelessly forward, but<br/>
unluckily it was too far off. It tumbled over, but at once<br/>
got on its feet again, and hurried back towards the mountains. I found, indeed, a red streak, but a brief search<br/>
had no further result. Time, also, was running short, as<br/>
twilight had already set in, and I had to hasten to the<br/>
proper station for the hyaenas.<br/>
<br/>
Led by the Arab, I rode through the desert, which<br/>
seemed to extend further and further into the plain, till<br/>
we came to a small sand-hill. The ambush had been well<br/>
chosen, and the dead ass was a conspicuous object on the<br/>
<br/>
white sand.<br/>
