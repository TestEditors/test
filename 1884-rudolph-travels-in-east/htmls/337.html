<span>DAMIE TTA. 209<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
is thoroughly Eastern; the streets, if possible, <span style="color: #ff0000;">dirtier</span>,<br/>
narrower, and more decorated with wooden nooks and<br/>
notches than most Arab towns. Where there is no water<br/>
running past the houses, the old Dutch character disappears.<br/>
<br/>
Damietta has, however, undeniably more of a northern<br/>
air (if the word be allowed in Africa) than the Arab<br/>
quarter of Cairo, or the towns of Upper Egypt. One<br/>
realizes that it might sometimes be almost cold here,<br/>
and the presence of the sea makes itself felt in dew.<br/>
The houses are more solidly built, better roofed; in a<br/>
word, arranged to be more and longer lived in. At our<br/>
worthy representative's everything was in splendid <span style="color: #0000FF;">order-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">European </span>rooms with Turkish rugs, Arab servants, and<br/>
the perfume of the East, the horrible attar of roses,<br/>
pervading the whole house. In everything it could be<br/>
seen that the owner was a genuine Levantine.<br/>
<br/>
After a hasty breakfast, during which our small stock<br/>
of luggage had been placed on pack-horses, we started<br/>
anew. Some of us were mounted on asses, two of the<br/>
gentlemen got into an old-fashioned coach, the pride of the<br/>
place, and in a few minutes the little caravan was in<br/>
motion to the regulation yells of the donkey-drivers. We<br/>
went through some streets, and then reached by a good<br/>
road between gardens, country houses, small palm woods,<br/>
and along a canal, the shore of the lake. Three miserable<br/>
little fishermen's huts stood on the sandy beach. Behind<br/>
us were lofty palms, thick hedges, and blooming verdure;<br/>
before us lay the broad, boundless grey-brown lake, with<br/>
its flat dunes and marshy shores, the image of drear<br/>
