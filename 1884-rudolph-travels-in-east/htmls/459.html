</span>too, were to be seen aloft in the course of the forenoon.<br/>
The ambush was unluckily too near the road, on which<br/>
there was constant <span style="color: #0000FF;">traffic</span>, and so great numbers of the<br/>
birds hovered over the spot without venturing to come<br/>
down. One solitary carrion vulture had the courage to<br/>
pass near the shed several times, for which he at length<br/>
paid the penalty with his life.<br/>
<br/>
After this I went once more to the castle, and waited<br/>
with Count Caboga the arrival of my fellow-travellers,<br/>
which soon followed. They came full trot into the courtyard, and I had forthwith to relate my hunting experiences<br/>
and give them the benefit of the events of the last few<br/>
hours. Count Caboga entertained us with an excellent<br/>
breakfast, and we started-some in carriages and some on<br/>
horseback-on our short journey to Bethlehem. The bad<br/>
stony road winds between old walls, olive gardens, and<br/>
half-ruined houses, always downhill, towards the steep<br/>
hillside on which this famous town, the birthplace of our<br/>

The name <span style="color: #0000FF;">Btt-lahem </span>is very ancient, and signifies in<br/>
the Hebrew "the place of bread." In Bible story this<br/>
place was known both for the fertility of the country round,<br/>
and as the home of the House of David. The name of<br/>
Ephrata, which also refers to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fruitfulness </span>of the district,<br/>
often occurs in the songs and warnings of the prophets:<br/>
"And thou, Bethlehem Ephrata, though thou be little<br/>
among the thousands of Judah, out of thee shall He come<br/>
forth unto me that is to be ruler in Israel; whose goings<br/>
forth have been from of old, from everlasting."<br/>
<br/>
The town is built picturesquely on the ridge of a hill,<br/>
