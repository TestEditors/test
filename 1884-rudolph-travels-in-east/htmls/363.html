islands, and the curious bridge-like building of the bar<br/>
came' into view.<br/>
<br/>
The arms of the Nile divide here-that of Damietta<br/>
from that of Rosetta. It is the southernmost point of the<br/>
Delta<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The tongue of land which divides the two branches<br/>
is united to the mainland by the iron bridges and the<br/>
gigantic weirs built by Mehmet Ali<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Their purpose is to<br/>
keep back the river at the time of <span style="color: #0000FF;">.low </span>water, so that the<br/>
innumerable canals of the Delta may be supplied with<br/>
water then, as well as during the inundation.<br/>
<br/>
The results of this enterprise, which at the same time<br/>
paralyzed the navigation of the N ile, are said to bear no<br/>
proportion to the great outlay incurred. A fort was built<br/>
at great cost on the tongue of <span style="color: #0000FF;">land</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">between </span>the weirs.<br/>
This isolated fort lies very low, and is little better than a<br/>
toy. A few old-fashioned guns, and a barrack with a small<br/>
garrison within, maintain its warlike aspect. The most<br/>
remarkable feature of the whole are the very fine and tall<br/>
rows of trees which adorn this otherwise desolate spot.<br/>
<br/>
We had to see it all, and were taken round the fort as<br/>
well as the weirs<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>After our survey the steamer set out for<br/>
home. We stopped at a long narrow island covered with<br/>
sand and bushy thickets, and searched it for game. Besides<br/>
some small water-bird, I shot a specimen of the beautiful<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">pale-chester</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>harder. A shallow clayey branch of the river<br/>
divides the island from the mainland, and across this ford<br/>
are driven great flocks of sheep and goats which feed on the<br/>
<br/>
bushes. On the banks of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile </span>we found several poor<br/>
fishing cabins.<br/>
