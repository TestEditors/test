<br/>
along which it extends for some distance. Between the<br/>
stony slopes level gardens of olives and vines are planted,<br/>
which give the place an air of sheltered verdure. The<br/>
houses built of white stone with flat roofs, the cupolas and<br/>
towers of the churches, the terraces and the convents, all<br/>
give to this hallowed spot the look of a much larger town<br/>
than it really is.<br/>
<br/>
After passing the first houses we turned into a narrow<br/>
street; uneven pavement, rough woodwork, gloomy walls,<br/>
and an incessant up and down hill are the first impression<br/>
the traveller gets. There is scope, however, for interesting<br/>
ethnographic study, for Bethlehem is far more than Jerusalem the type of an old Hebrew town. The people<br/>
whom one sees on the flat roofs of their houses, in the<br/>
streets, and at the windows, are old Scriptural Jews, just as<br/>
imagination has depicted them. They wear big turbans,<br/>
flowing robes, and bright vests; the rich are arrayed in the<br/>
garb of the Pharisees, and the poor like those who heard<br/>
in the streets and squares the life-giving words and precepts<br/>
from the lips of the Redeemer.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">The </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">-faces </span>are thoroughly Hebrew; the long bent nose,<br/>
the pale complexion, the black or red beards curled and<br/>
ending in two points, are such as we see in the pictures of<br/>
Christ and His apostles. The women are most striking,<br/>
wrapped in broad, full, coloured clothes, with a white cloth<br/>
picturesquely draped round the head, of pale complexion,<br/>
and with the most beautiful eyes, features, and hair that<br/>
can be imagined. I have never seen such beautiful women<br/>
as in Bethlehem, and nowhere else so many of them in one<br/>
town. One beauty follows another. The noblest <span style="color: #ff0000;">Madonna<br/>
