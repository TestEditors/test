<br/>
</span>trusted. Our camp <span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>been pitched near the mosque.<br/>
The spot is most picturesque. It is a small plateau covered<br/>
with grass and shrubs, shut in to the south by the red<br/>
mountains, and to the west by the grey-green mountains<br/>
which follow the Valley of the Jordan. To the north the<br/>
plateau falls gently, towards the east steeply, in the shape of<br/>
grey slate-clay sides into this valley. We got a splendid<br/>
view here over the broad, moist, green plain. We were<br/>
glad to have reached even the vicinity of the sacred river<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">-the </span>bountiful stream of life, dispensing blessing to this<br/>
land, and promising sport to us.<br/>
<br/>
The partridges were piping on all sides, and we<br/>
divided to look for some of this excellent game, <span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">unfortunately </span>the sun had already set and twilight drew on. I<br/>
put up some quail in the long grass, and quantities of small<br/>
birds flew from bush to bush. It was impossible to shoot,<br/>
so we all went back to our camp to dine and sleep peacefully beside the grave of the great sage and prophet.<br/>
Moses.<br/>
<br/>
At sunrise next morning the whole party started once<br/>
more. The great caravan was sent the shortest way by<br/>
Jericho to Ain-es-Sultan, while we, guided by our Bedouins,<br/>
and with the gendarmes for escort, made an interesting<br/>
expedition to the Dead Sea. We rode from <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ebi-Musa<br/>
</span>due east, across steep mountain slopes, by narrow paths<br/>
and washed-away crevasses, over a slaty-grey soil quite<br/>
destitute of vegetation. Some eagles and vultures sat on<br/>
the sharp ledges and projections that in this part run down<br/>
from the mountain parallel to each other and separated by<br/>
narrow gorges. In an hour we had come to the foot of<br/>
<br/>
