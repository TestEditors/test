<span>LEIBNITZ AND THE CANAL <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>SUEZ. 255<br/>

an oracle warned him that he was only working for the<br/>
barbarians, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. for foreigners. The Persian kings Cambyses<br/>
and Darius <span style="color: #0000FF;">I.</span>, a hundred years after Necho, were less alarmed<br/>
at such <span style="color: #0000FF;">munitions</span>, and completed the communication between<br/>
the Nile and the Red Sea. The remains of this canal<br/>
were found in our own day in the cutting of the isthmus,<br/>
and the ruins found close at hand of buildings with Persian<br/>
inscriptions mark three stations on the long line of water<br/>
which led from the Crocodile Lake to the Gulf of Suez.<br/>
A further extension of the system of canals was made<br/>
under the Ptolemies. A branch canal was carried from<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Phakusa </span>(now Fakus) on the Pelusian arm of the Nile<br/>
into Lake Menzaleh; from thence the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dattel </span>Lake could<br/>
be reached, which in its turn was connected with the<br/>
Crocodile and Bitter Lakes. In this way the Mediterranean and Red Seas were united at their nearest points,<br/>
and a waterway created, which for the then commercial<br/>
traffic of the world was of the greatest value. Under the<br/>
Romans these works fell into decay, until Amru, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">well</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">known </span>general of the Caliph Omar, made it his business to<br/>
restore the old sea-way and to place Cairo in communication<br/>
with Suez by a canal. In the eighth century of our era this<br/>
canal was no longer navigable. In the year 1671 Leibnitz,<br/>
in a plan which he submitted to Louis XIV., set forth the<br/>
importance and necessity of canal communication between<br/>
the two seas. His proposal obtained no attention. When<br/>
General Buonaparte made his famous expedition to Egypt<br/>
the importance of a communication between the seas did<br/>
not escape him. The execution of such a project failed<br/>
through the faulty calculations of the engineer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Lepere</span>,<br/>
