country. My uncle, the bishop, and I sat on the same<br/>
divan. We were scarcely seated when priests appeared<br/>
with horrid beverages. We made our escape as soon as<br/>
possible, and went to the Milk Grotto, <span style="color: #ff0000;">whii2h </span>we reached<br/>
by a broad entrance and a few steps. Tradition has it that<br/>
the holy family having hidden here, some drops of the<br/>
mother's milk fell upon the stone. Many women visit this<br/>
spot in the belief that a libation on this stone will increase<br/>
the supply of those who require it. Christians and Moslems<br/>
both hold this grotto in the deepest veneration. The altar<br/>
inside it belongs to the Latins. After we had taken leave<br/>
of the Greek and Latin clergy, we hastened past the last<br/>
houses of the town, along the hill-side, between olive<br/>
gardens and stone walls, to our camp, which lay near the<br/>
filthy but prettily situated village of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Betsahur</span>.<br/>

The inhabitants crowded round with curiosity, and the<br/>
Turkish gendarmes had difficulty in keeping the camp<br/>
clear. Two hunters soon appeared offering their services.<br/>
They were a handsome pair of brothers, citizens of Bethlehem, in complete Jewish dress. There was a touch of<br/>
the vagabond about them, and they professed to live by<br/>
partridge shooting. One of them spoke French well, and<br/>
seemed to have dealings with several tribes of Bedouins<br/>
in hunting matters. He undertook to arrange an ibex<br/>
hunt, and also to procure us some young live specimens.<br/>
He was a Christian, like all Bethlehemites, and had fought<br/>
bravely in the French army against the Germans.<br/>
<br/>
Count Lesseps met him during his journey in Palestine<br/>
and took him as servant. In France he made him enter<br/>
the army which was marching to the Rhine. In this <span style="color: #0000FF;">way<br/>
