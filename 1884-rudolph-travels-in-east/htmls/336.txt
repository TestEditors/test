<span>208 TRA VELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The evening drew in, and we had to hasten home by<br/>
the road by which we had come, and through the streets<br/>
of the town, which at this hour were very animated.<br/>
The moment dinner was over we drove to the railway<br/>
to set out on our expedition to Menzaleh.<br/>
<br/>
Some gentlemen had assembled in the station at<br/>
Cairo to bid us farewell-among them our friend Brugsch<br/>
Pasha. Baron Saurma was also present and ready to<br/>
accompany us to Lake Menzaleh. In a few minutes<br/>
Herr Zimmerman, our faithful attendant on all our railway<br/>
journeys, told <span style="color: #0000FF;">us </span>that it was time to start<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>We talked a great deal for the first hour in the train,<br/>
and then one after the other <span style="color: #ff0000;">betook </span>himself to rest.<br/>
In order that our sleep should not be broken, they were<br/>
so good as to allow our carriage to stand in the station<br/>
at Damietta, which we reached during the night. When<br/>
we woke, therefore, before sunrise on the 17th of March,<br/>
we found ourselves alone on a siding.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as all the party had assembled, we went<br/>
down to the bank of the canal, and were taken in a<br/>
small steamer to the opposite side.<br/>
<br/>
The town pleased me very much. It is genuinely<br/>
Arab, and yet the parts which border the canal reminded<br/>
us at once of a Dutch or Belgian seaport. The many<br/>
little sailing vessels going up and down, with their jolly<br/>
masts and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rags</span>, make Damietta look like Antwerp<br/>
translated into Arabic.<br/>
<br/>
We went on foot from the quay to the house of our<br/>
consular agent, a wasted and intensely droll old man,<br/>
who was extremely kind to us. The interior of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">town<br/>
