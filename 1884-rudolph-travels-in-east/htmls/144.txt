<br/>
broken <span style="color: #0000FF;">rocks-only </span>at the northern point of the island there<br/>
is a small strip with a flat shore, and a marshy lagoon in<br/>
miniature. Between the shore and the central rock there is<br/>
a level space seldom exceeding three hundred paces, and<br/>
covered with fine sand.<br/>
<br/>
On the northern side of the island this little plain is in<br/>
many places full of great stones and boulders, which have<br/>
broken from the central mass and rolled down. Except the<br/>
bushes on the shore, all is bare; even the <span style="color: #ff0000;">scantiest </span>grass<br/>
will not grow. The waters wash the crumbling shore<br/>
unceasingly, and before long the whole island will be<br/>
reduced to the imperishable rock in the centre.<br/>
<br/>
After a <span style="color: #0000FF;">short </span>stay the Grand Duke and Prince Taxis<br/>
left the camp, and were quickly followed by Baron Saurma<br/>
and myself. Our plan was to start in two parties from one<br/>
point, each with some dachshunds, and to beat the mountain cone, driving one against the other till we met at the<br/>
north side.<br/>
<br/>
Among the first rocks two stone plovers rose, one of<br/>
which I shot. The invaluable Osman led the dogs, which<br/>
he loosed among the stones. Now began an interesting<br/>
but most fatiguing hunt. One had to jump over smooth<br/>
rocks and rough heaps of stories to follow the dogs. The<br/>
formation of the mountain is most remarkable. You find<br/>
stones of incredible shapes, many like huge mushrooms;<br/>
beneath it is hollow, pierced in all directions with passages;<br/>
through crevices, and sometimes between wide rifts across<br/>
which you must leap, you catch sight of the dark passages<br/>
in which the dogs are hunting, and every now and again<br/>
creeping out into sight<span style="color: #0000FF;">.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'<br/>
