<span>72 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The line lay at first beside the narrow strip of tilled land<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">stretches </span>along between the western bank of the<br/>
river Nile and the desert. The thorough character of<br/>
Egyptian cultivation was very apparent here-high-pressure<br/>
tillage confined to a narrow space. Simple fellaheen<br/>
villages alternated with palm forests, larger than those of<br/>
Lower Egypt. Townships, one might almost say, of<br/>
circular dovecotes, built in Arab mode, struck us. Doves<br/>
are here provided with shelter and protection only for the<br/>
sake of the valuable guano they afford. Occasionally their<br/>
eggs and down are made use of. These birds never acquire<br/>
a domesticated character. In colour and size they are true<br/>
rock pigeons, and are quite untamed in habits.<br/>
<br/>
The line often approaches the Nile, always on the left<br/>
bank. To the east the desert mountains advance close<br/>
to the stream; to the west, on the other hand, lies the<br/>
wave-like, moving, almost flat, Libyan desert.<br/>
<br/>
The railway passes all the Pyramids, and, in fact, near<br/>
enough to see them well. At first, the grey heads of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ghiz√©h<br/>
</span>appear, the proudest of their race. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Next </span>come to view the<br/>
smaller members of the family, those of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sakkara</span>. We<br/>
Europeans are accustomed to see a solitary palm in a<br/>
hothouse, or on the southern coast of our scantily portioned<br/>
quarter of the globe. Only in the rustling, far-spreading<br/>
palm forest has this tree its full significance as the symbol<br/>
of sunny Africa.<br/>
<br/>
At ten in the morning our train turned from the<br/>
main line, which follows the course of the Nile to Siut,<br/>
and took us along a branch-line westward into the <span style="color: #0000FF;">bare<br/>
</span>and barren desert. A railway journey in such a region,<br/>
