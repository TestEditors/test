<span>98 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
After a two hours' voyage we arrived, having passed<br/>
a narrow strip of willow bushes, at a great sand-bank, on<br/>
which our camp stood, all ready and comfortably arranged.<br/>
The spot had been well chosen, for this perfectly dry bank<br/>
separates the lake from a considerable marsh. As dinner<br/>
was not yet ready, some of us went straight to the marsh,<br/>
which lay between our camp and the first fields of the<br/>
cultivated land.<br/>
<br/>
On this ground, covered with reeds, willows, waterwort,<br/>
and brown bad-smelling peat, were swarms of woodcocks<br/>
and pool snipe; some ducks also, and two species of plover<br/>
rose in front of us. Toads hopped about in numbers, and<br/>
every spot was full of poisonous insects.<br/>
<br/>
Several marsh birds were shot in haste, and we <span style="color: #ff0000;">withdrew </span>before twilight fell from the fever-laden atmosphere of<br/>
the marsh. A beautiful sunset and a right good dinner<br/>
brought an exciting day to a close, and repose fell on<br/>
the camp.<br/>
<br/>
On the 27th we started early, with the intention of<br/>
hunting all the way back to the station at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abuskar</span>.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, we went through the marsh, and some snipe<br/>
and various other kinds pf marsh birds <span style="color: #ff0000;">repaid </span>us. Crossing<br/>
a field on which herons and spurred peewits were successfully shot, we came to a region of sand-hills, covered with<br/>
short scanty grass and withered shrubs, which divides the<br/>
marsh from the tilled fields. The dachshunds rummaged<br/>
up some hares. One of the gentlemen and I had the luck<br/>
to kill each of us one of these droll creatures<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>It <span style="color: #0000FF;">was </span>the true <span style="color: #ff0000;">hare</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">of </span>the desert, a small, thin, <span style="color: #ff0000;">deercoloured</span>, long-legged animal, with ridiculously big <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/>
