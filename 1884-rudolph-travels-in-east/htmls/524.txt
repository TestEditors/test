<br/>
<br/>
besides <span style="color: #0000FF;">quails </span>and snipe, were shot; but some eagles at a<br/>
great distance were missed.<br/>
<br/>
As the midday heat became excessive we resolved to<br/>
suspend our shooting for a time. Going down to the brook,<br/>
I found in the clay tracks of the hyaena, wolf, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackal</span>,<br/>
also those of the lynx and the smaller cats. According to<br/>
the report of the Bedouins, the animals of canine race<br/>
descend from the hills in search of water at night only,<br/>
whereas the cat family dwell in the thickets and trees close<br/>
at' hand, but are never driven from their hiding-places even<br/>
by dogs.<br/>
<br/>
The track of the porcupine was also pretty frequent,<br/>
and once the dogs ran to a burrow, where we found some<br/>
quills and recent traces of this curious creature. We now<br/>
resolved to look him up in his own den, and to this end<br/>
my huntsman was <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>to the camp with instructions<br/>
to bring the<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>dachshunds and some shovels back with him.<br/>
Meanwhile the sportsmen lay down under a tree to drink<br/>
lemonade and smoke cigarettes. The Grand Duke had in<br/>
the course of the morning shot a very rare animal, the<br/>
kangaroo-like jerboa.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as the dachshunds arrived we set them at the<br/>
burrow. We soon heard snarling and barking, but, alas!<br/>
the dogs, usually so valiant, soon crept forth to the light of<br/>
day, with their tails timorously between their legs, and<br/>
would not venture into the burrows again. We then told<br/>
the Bedouins to dig-a process which advanced but slowly,<br/>
for the heat was scorching, and free wild sport is more to<br/>
their taste than servile labour.<br/>
<br/>
We felt that our endeavour was vain, and resolved <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
