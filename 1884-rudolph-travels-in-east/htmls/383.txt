<span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">ISTHMUS </span>OF SUEZ. 247<br/>

<br/>
expulsion the peninsula of Suez saw the Egyptian armies<br/>
march eastward to avenge the tyranny of so many centuries. The victorious Pharaohs advanced to Babylon and<br/>
Nineveh, subdued the numerous territories and tribes<br/>
on their way, and ruled for more than four hundred years<br/>
over the greatest and most powerful empire of Western<br/>
Asia.<br/>
<br/>
"<span style="color: #0000FF;">To </span>ward off attack from the east the peninsula of<br/>
Suez was provided with walls and fortifications which<br/>
began near Pelusium, east of Port Said, and extended to<br/>
Heliopolis. The permission of the Pharaohs was necessary<br/>
before any of the Semitic race could pass the fortifications,<br/>
especially in time of famine, to seek food for themselves<br/>
and their cattle in the rich pasture lands by Lake Menzaleh.<br/>

requisite <span style="color: #0000FF;">official </span>steps preparatory to a settlement in this<br/>
part of the Delta. With the decay of the power of the<br/>
Pharaohs the Isthmus of Suez became the scene of constant<br/>
movement of the tribes in its northern part. Incursions,<br/>
attacks, and battle upon battle occurred in the vicinity of<br/>
Pelusium at the outer line of defence, and foreign armies<br/>
marched up by the Pelusian bank of the Nile as far as<br/>
Heliopolis and the ancient strongly fortified seat of government at Memphis.<br/>
<br/>
With the blocking of the Pelusian mouth of the Nile<br/>
by the draught of the Mediterranean waters from the<br/>
Syrian coast, and the neglect of the canals and waterworks<br/>
on the eastern side of .the Delta during the darkest times<br/>
of Egyptian history, cultivation retreated from this former<br/>
garden of God, and the fields and plains once so rich in<br/>
