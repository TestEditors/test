</span>In Palestine this diversity is even more distinctly noticeable. On the whole, the Asiatic jackal is larger than the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">North </span>African, and amongst several which were <span style="color: #0000FF;">tolerably<br/>
</span>like each other, I shot one which could not be compared<br/>
with any previous specimen, either in size or colour, and<br/>
yet one could not describe this abnormal creature as a<br/>
wolf.<br/>
<br/>
The dogs of the East, however, often bear traces of<br/>
savage origin, which is in no way surprising when one<br/>
remembers their uncontrolled, ownerless life on the one<br/>
hand, and on the other the nightly prowlings, frequently<br/>
from dusk to dawn, of wolves and jackals in the immediate<br/>
vicinity of the towns and villages.<br/>
<br/>
I go so far as to assert that in those parts of Africa and<br/>
Asia where dogs, wolves, and jackals inhabit a limited<br/>
area, the jackal of pure race, as a true species, does not<br/>
exist. The dog and the wolf are better preserved; but the<br/>
Canis <span style="color: #0000FF;">aureus </span>of scientific books I have sought in vain as a<br/>
distinctly marked breed..<br/>
<br/>
Let us now revert to our travelling adventures. The<br/>
steamer proceeded till ten in the forenoon, when we stopped<br/>
at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Dabbabieh</span>, by the sand-bank on which, in our upward<br/>
course, I had seen the large <span style="color: #0000FF;">eared </span>vulture sitting. On<br/>
landing we found the fellaheen, who had punctually<br/>
obeyed our <span style="color: #0000FF;">orders<br/>
<br/>
</span>A small reed hut had been erected; and the bones<br/>
of sheep and dogs showed that the vultures had had their<br/>
daily bait. We had great difficulty in ridding ourselves of<br/>
the inquisitive <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellaheen</span>, who, proud of their performances, now wished to be present at the sport.<br/>
