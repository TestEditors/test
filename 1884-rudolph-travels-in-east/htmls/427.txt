<span>THE CHAPEL OF THE SEPULCHRE. 281<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
the Chapel of the Sepulchre. This small place of worship<br/>
was long in the exclusive possession of the Eastern<br/>
Churches, and it bears the full impress of the Greek<br/>
Church both within and without. It is enriched with gold<br/>
and silver, with the black pictures of saints set in metal,<br/>
and has all the peculiar character which distinguishes the<br/>
orthodox Eastern Church.<br/>
<br/>
Conducted by the patriarch, we were permitted to enter<br/>
the interior of the chapel. The vestibule is entered <span style="color: #0000FF;">by </span>a<br/>
low gate, through which one must literally creep. Then<br/>
one is in the true sanctuary, the shrine of the Christian<br/>
faith. The naked rock shows everywhere between the<br/>
rich decoration, and we venerate this bare stone, for it is<br/>
the same on which the Son of God was laid.<br/>
<br/>
The perfume of roses and incense, Greek pomp, the<br/>
ruddy glow of the lamps, the murmur of the Latin prayers,<br/>
all is overpowering. The narrow vault seems to be the<br/>
world, the cradle of our faith. With a believing ardour<br/>
the pilgrim presses his hot lips on the bare stone, which<br/>
embodies for him his most sacred emotions, and speaks<br/>
of comfort, strength, and hope.<br/>
<br/>
In a few moments the patriarch led us out again, and<br/>
we all knelt before the chapel, while the sacred chants of<br/>
the priests resounded through the majestic halls. We took<br/>
leave of the patriarch at the door of the chapel. We<br/>
desired to offer our first <span style="color: #ff0000;">prayersat </span>this sacred spot, but we<br/>
proposed to visit and examine the church in detail on the<br/>
next day. I shall therefore give a cursory description of<br/>
it later-a detailed account would require elaborate study.<br/>
We now passed through some more narrow streets to the<br/>
