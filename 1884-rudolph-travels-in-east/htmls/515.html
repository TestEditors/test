from the other bank, and one of the gentlemen called to me<br/>
that an armadillo had just been missed and was running<br/>
from the dogs. The Bedouins and I followed the chase<br/>
at full speed, when suddenly all was still. We found beside<br/>
a tree, built up round its roots <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">stems</span>, a beaver-like<br/>
tower, several feet high, made out of branches. One cannot<br/>
otherwise describe this admirable piece of animal architecture. On two sides there were circular entrances. When<br/>
the Bedouins saw this establishment they drew <span style="color: #0000FF;">back<br/>
</span>cautiously.<br/>
<br/>
Salim posted me beside one entrance, while he directed<br/>
his people to light a fire by the other. As the flames burnt<br/>
up brightly and the building began to crackle, a peculiar<br/>
creature, somewhat like a dragon, of orange colour and<br/>
certainly over four feet in length, crept circumspectly out,<br/>
and was going to take itself off at an easy trot, when a <span style="color: #ff0000;">wellaimed </span>shot put an end to its life. My interesting booty was<br/>
a lizard. I do not know much about reptiles, but, so far as I<br/>
can judge, we had one of the great Varan lizards before us.<br/>
Our next object was to send this rare specimen undamaged<br/>
to the camp, and as the Arabs positively refused to touch<br/>
the cold body with their hands, we had to construct a small<br/>
bier with sticks, to deposit the mighty dead upon it, and to<br/>
despatch a Bedouin in charge of it. We continued our<br/>
sport, but we soon observed that the birds had been scared<br/>
by the multitude of shots, and we seemed this time to have<br/>
no luck with the wild boars. The entire shooting party<br/>
therefore <span style="color: #ff0000;">betook </span>itself to a shady spot under a large tree,<br/>
and, weary with the intense and oppressive heat, we all lay<br/>
down in the grass, even the Bedouins, while their sturdy<br/>
