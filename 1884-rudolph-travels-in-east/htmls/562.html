times of Christianity, to have been the scene of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Transfiguration</span>, and has been venerated accordingly. Origen<br/>
and Jerome describe it. The Crusaders built the first<br/>
convent on Mount Tabor, which, however, was again destroyed by the Moslems. In the year 1212, Melek-el-Adil,<br/>
the brother of Saladin, built a fortress on it, which was<br/>
afterwards fruitlessly besieged by the Christians, and then<br/>
in the course of time, when it had lost its importance, was<br/>
razed by the Moslems themselves. The present convents are not of ancient date, and have been built on<br/>
the ruins of those which first <span style="color: #ff0000;">stood</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">there</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The whole neighbourhood is full of historic reminiscences,<br/>
and therefore doubly interesting. In the vicinity of Tabor<br/>
a circular hill rises from the midst of the green vale; at its<br/>
foot Saladin obtained <span style="color: #0000FF;">his-greatest </span>victory on the 3rd and<br/>
4th of July, 1187. The power of the Crusaders was then<br/>
finally broken. King Guy de Lusignan and many others<br/>
were taken prisoners, the knights sold for slaves, the<br/>
Templars and Brothers of St. John all executed, and Saladin<br/>
slew the Grand Master of the Templars with his own hand.<br/>
This same hill is indicated as the scene of the Sermon on<br/>
the Mount, and of the miracle of the loaves and fishes.<br/>
<br/>
In the evening we dined in the large room of the<br/>
convent, and then went early to rest. The Grand Duke<br/>
was suffering much from fever, and had to take quantities of<br/>
quinine. On the 12th of April we awoke with the sun.<br/>
Our last night in tents was now past, and I could not leave<br/>
my airy quarters without much regret. We descended the<br/>
mountain from the convent on foot, as riding was all but<br/>
impossible. The, <span style="color: #0000FF;">column</span>, with the sick and barely <span style="color: #0000FF;">con<br/>
