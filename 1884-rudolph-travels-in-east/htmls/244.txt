<span>146 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The brown, scantily clad creatures, with their hair<br/>
twisted up on wooden sticks, arranged in the form of rays,<br/>
and their nose, ear, and arm rings, looked most fantastic.<br/>
It was a dance of savages-as wild a medley as can be<br/>
imagined.<br/>
<br/>
After this exhibition they rode upon their dromedaries<br/>
in quick time, performing various feats. Only the young<br/>
ones took part in this display; the elders stood showing<br/>
their dazzling white teeth between their dark lips and<br/>

Here also, at the graves of Caliphs, <span style="color: #0000FF;">some </span>windmills<br/>
stand on the low sand-hills; but the other buildings bear<br/>
no comparison with those of Cairo. Poor gravestones and<br/>
half-ruined sheiks' graves with plain domes take the<br/>
place of the splendid sepulchral mosque. On the other<br/>
