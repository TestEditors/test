<span>THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">UNIVERSITY </span>OF CAIRO. 45<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
of <span style="color: #ff0000;">1slam-Shafettes</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Malekites</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hanefites</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hambalites<br/>
</span>--are attached in the rear. Innumerable coloured lamps<br/>
hang from the roof, and a decorated side chamber is shown<br/>
as the tomb of the saint <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abd-er-Rahman-Kichya</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The most remarkable spectacle, however, by far, is<br/>
afforded by the ten thousand students from all Mohammedan countries who crowd the sanctuary no less than<br/>
the halls, courts, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">vestibules </span>of this great building.<br/>
<br/>
The various types of humanity, from the black of the<br/>
negro to the pale yellow of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cherkesse</span>, are there<br/>
represented. The extraordinary combination of colour and<br/>
costume delights the eye; right studious Bedouins even, in<br/>
their white mantles, range themselves among the scholars.<br/>
<br/>
The teachers sit on raised seats in little sheds made out<br/>
of plaited and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Iatticed </span>reeds; most comic figures they are,<br/>
mostly old, often deformed, in Oriental garb, turban on<br/>
head, and spectacles on nose. With the most ridiculous<br/>
gestures they shriek with hoarse voice their lecture at the<br/>
hearers. Old dusty Koran books, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">pros </span>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">cons </span>of<br/>
Eastern <span style="color: #0000FF;">lore</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lie </span>before them, and with the help of a long<br/>
bamboo rod they maintain discipline and attention in the<br/>
ranks of their scholars. Round each teacher, squat, lie, or<br/>
sit on the bare earth a thickly set circle of apathetic-looking<br/>
youths. Some listen, others repeat aloud. It may be<br/>
imagined how noisily everything goes on in this so-called<br/>
High School and these interminable lecture-rooms. The<br/>
sight is perplexing indeed for any European, for it would<br/>
be difficult for us to conceive any more astonishing spectacle<br/>
than the course of proceedings in this world-renowned<br/>
University of Cairo.<br/>
