<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1213</span>' TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The character of the country remained the same; only<br/>
the receding mountains made way for the much-praised<br/>
plain of Thebes, famous even in the history of antiquity<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">for- </span>its riches and cultivation.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">_</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span>"<span style="color: #0000FF;">r. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">At </span>twelve we came to the landing-place of the rather<br/>
important town of Luxor. A mail steamer and several<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">duhabiyas </span>belonging to European travellers were at the<br/>
pier. The. modern Luxor, a genuine Arab clay-built<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">towh</span>,<span style="color: #ff0000;">'étands </span>in the middle of, and is partly built<br/>
against<span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>the ruins of the old Egyptian monuments.<br/>
On both sides of the Nile the land is covered to a<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">éorisiderable </span>distance with the remains of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hundredgated </span>Thebes, and on the Libyan bank they extend<br/>
into the mountains.<br/>
<br/>
We kinded at once on arriving, climbed up the steep<br/>
sandy bank, and on the primitive Place in front of the<br/>
dirty little <span style="color: #ff0000;">Htstel </span>Luxor, hired some donkeys, on which<br/>
We rode through the narrow streets of the town,<br/>
passing a simple and very unsavoury bazaar, rich however<br/>
in interest, owing to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">variohs </span>types of people frequenting<br/>
it, and came to the quarter of the town inhabited<br/>
by none but dancers. Luxor is known for its store of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">jGhawazi</span>"--the chief settlement of those despised outcasts. Beyond the <span style="color: #0000FF;">last </span>houses, in sand and dirt, a gipsy<br/>
camp had been pitched.<br/>
<br/>
We soon reached the open country, and trotted on<br/>
merrily among palm woods and well-cultivated fields along<br/>
a dyke<span style="color: #ff0000;">:<br/>
<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">f. </span>From <span style="color: #ff0000;">afarrwe </span>could see the lofty gates<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span>pillars, and walls<br/>
of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">famou</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'s</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>ruins of Karnak. They stand <span style="color: #0000FF;">on-the<br/>
