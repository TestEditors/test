<span>A DRIVE THROUGH <span style="color: #ff0000;">ALEXANDRIA</span>. 25<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Alexandria has this character completely, and yet, elegant<br/>
and regular though the streets may be, a something clings<br/>
about them which is strange to us.<br/>
<br/>
The Oriental dirt and neglect which lend a certain picturesque charm to Arab towns, accords ill with the straight,<br/>
stencilled lines of Western architecture. You feel at every<br/>
step the presence of the stranger, who seeks to put his own<br/>
impress on a foreign world. The free sand of the desert<br/>
bears unwillingly the European town, and yet more unwillingly bears with the pale-faced foreigners' greed of<br/>
gain.<br/>
<br/>
Driving through some of the principal streets we came<br/>
to the Place Mehmet Ali, in whose centre stands the<br/>
equestrian statue of the great warrior, Mehmet Ali; the<br/>
adventurous and successful son of a Macedonian watchman<br/>
from Kawala. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Not </span>without a motive did Mehmet Ali give<br/>
his full favour to Alexandria. If he succeeded in raising<br/>
it in all respects, it was that the world might liken <span style="color: #0000FF;">him</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>to his model, Alexander the Great.<br/>
<br/>
The traveller stands in Alexandria on historic ground.<br/>
But never will this town again attain such glory and such<br/>
grace as in the days of the great Alexandrian Library,<br/>
when art, literature, and the whole intercourse of the then<br/>
civilized world found its centre here.<br/>
<br/>
The European streets are full of animation. The people<br/>
have that indescribable look of a mixed race to which one<br/>
gives the name of Levantine. It is a mixture of Italian,<br/>
Greek, Armenian, and Turkish features-almost all wear<br/>
European clothes, generally, however, with the fez. Besides<br/>
these, I saw Dalmatian and Albanian costumes, Turkish,<br/>
<br/>
