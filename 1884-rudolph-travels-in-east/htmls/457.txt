<span>SEARCH FOR OUR PREY.. 303<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
was not small at finding that the great heavy donkey had<br/>
disappeared. No sign of dragging was to be seen on the<br/>
ground. The grass was not turned, and so it seemed<br/>
proved that an unusually strong beast of prey must have<br/>
simply carried the heavy ass away. As some of the small<br/>
scraps were also gone, we searched about and found a large<br/>
jackal not twenty paces off. Longer legged, bigger, and<br/>
with a shorter and more bushy tail than the Egyptian, and<br/>
a yellow coat only broken by a greyish-blue stripe on the<br/>
back, the fine creature seemed to me different from any<br/>
jackal which I had previously killed.<br/>
<br/>
We soon found a track of blood which led direct from<br/>
the place to the road, and across it to a wall. Here we could<br/>
see that the ass had been dragged over the stones, as hair<br/>
and blood stuck to the sharp corners. On the other side<br/>
the carrion had again been carried. The track of blood<br/>
now took the direction of one of the deeply cut valleys<br/>
which lead towards the mountains by the Jordan<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>I crept cautiously forward, and looking over a mound<br/>
I saw about fifty steps in advance a dark object, and beside<br/>
it a small orange-coloured animal. One of those <span style="color: #0000FF;">wonderfully </span>pretty dainty ferrets (desert fox), with his long bat's<br/>
ears, was making a comfortable breakfast. A good shot<br/>
laid the little fellow low.<br/>
<br/>
Hastening to the spot, I found my prey lying by the head<br/>
of our ass. As a matter of course, I examined everything<br/>
with minute care. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">heavy</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">large </span>skull of a full-grown<br/>
ass of the large Asiatic breed had been simply bitten clean<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>off; one could see the marks of the teeth. The beast of<br/>
prey had vanished with the rest of the body. To this spot<br/>
