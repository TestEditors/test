<span>FAREWELL TO EGYPT. 261<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
canal buildings, the ships' docks, building yards and workshops, the vessels, and especially the Indiamen, lend the<br/>
whole scene a purely Western aspect.<br/>
<br/>
Late in the day we gave a dinner on board the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>,<br/>
to which Abd-el-Kader Pasha and the French gentlemen<br/>
were invited; when it grew dark our countrymen who<br/>
reside here improvised a <span style="color: #0000FF;">beautiful </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">illumination </span>of the<br/>
harbour and a procession of boats. Several brightly<br/>
illuminated boats with bands of music flitted round our<br/>
vessel, and brilliant fireworks were let off on land.<br/>
<br/>
The hour of separation soon came. Our guests left<br/>
the Miramar, and Abd-el-Kader Pasha also. We had all<br/>
learnt to value and respect him. He had been a faithful<br/>
companion to us and a true friend.<br/>
<br/>
We had passed glorious never-to-be-forgotten days in<br/>
Africa, and bore away with us impressions of ancient<br/>
grandeur from the Dark Continent and from radiant Egypt,<br/>
from the graves of thousands of years of an ancient but<br/>
now vanished civilization.<br/>
