<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, by the time I got to the spot, the large<br/>
birds of prey had already <span style="color: #0000FF;">finished </span>their meal, and sat inert,<br/>
but unapproachable, a few hundred paces off in the desert.<br/>
The ass was horribly pulled to pieces; whole portions were<br/>
gone, and what remained was covered with feathers and<br/>
dirt by the vultures.<br/>
<br/>
I had done the Arab wrong. I immediately found the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">hyana </span>track, leading on the one side to the carrion, and on<br/>
the other to the desert. On the way back to <span style="color: #ff0000;">MedinetHabu </span>I noticed some quite recent tracks of <span style="color: #ff0000;">the </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">igazelle</span>.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I had joined the rest of the party we began<br/>
our survey of the wonderful and beautiful Ramesseum, a<br/>
temple of the dead, in good preservation, which lies near<br/>
the village.<br/>
<br/>
I shall do well to quote, in his own words, some notes<br/>
on the monuments of this part of Thebes, which I owe to<br/>
my friend Brugsch: "The west side of Thebes, no less<br/>
rich in monuments than the eastern quarter of the town,<br/>
was considered the abode of the dead-the necropolis<br/>
proper. In the rocky limestone of the plain, as well as in<br/>
the pierced and hollowed declivities of the precipitous<br/>
adjacent mountains, millions of worthy Thebans found their<br/>
last <span style="color: #ff0000;">resiting-places</span>. In the plain, at the foot of the steep<br/>
cliffs, sepulchral temples rose in all directions-their doors<br/>
always opening to the east, which gave the necropolis the<br/>
character of a most sacred region. The temple of Gurna,<br/>
which still exists at the northern end of the long range of<br/>
sanctuaries, and which was erected by Ramses II. to the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">memory </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">of </span>his but little <span style="color: #0000FF;">known</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">grandfather </span>(of the same<br/>
name), and his own <span style="color: #ff0000;">sepulchiial </span>temple, the so-called <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ram<br/>
<br/>
