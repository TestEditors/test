<span>A <span style="color: #0000FF;">HAUNT </span>FOR THE <span style="color: #0000FF;">VULTURE</span>. 297<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We rode back by the walls from the Valley of Kedron<br/>
towards our camp. At the slaughter-yard I dismounted<br/>
and made a fruitless attempt to approach a carrion vulture.<br/>
Hundreds of large vultures soared aloft, and dogs haunted<br/>
the bloody spot. The horrible smell obliged me to make<br/>
a speedy flight.<br/>
