<br/>
which, as well as the carriages, reminded me of England,<br/>
in all but its somewhat neglected look.<br/>
<br/>
The train took us along the dunes, which separate the<br/>
lakes from the sea, to Ramleh, the summer quarters and<br/>
sea bathing-place of the wealthy Egyptians. Here and<br/>
there, especially close to the town, you see the dunes with<br/>
the yellow sands of the desert-the tents of the gipsy and<br/>
the Bedouin, dejected camels and braying asses, Arab huts<br/>
and dilapidated tombs, are scattered along them; but for<br/>
the most the dunes have been transformed into gardens<br/>
and smiling villas.<br/>
<br/>
Orange and lemon trees bowed with fruit, beside the<br/>
slender palm, make the whole place seem like a park. On<br/>
arriving in Ramleh we waited but ten minutes for the next<br/>
train to return to Alexandria. This short expedition gives<br/>
to strangers a glimpse of the paradise which human industry<br/>
can produce from the most barren soil. On our return to<br/>
Alexandria we drove along the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Mahmudiyé </span>Canal to <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
</span>large public garden of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ginénet-en-Nusha</span>. The drive along<br/>
the canal is very interesting..<br/>
<br/>
The road was very gay. Besides country folk the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beau</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">mantle </span>of Alexandria drove in carriages, <span style="color: #0000FF;">flys</span>, and handsome<br/>
equipages through the fine avenues to the lovely gardens<br/>
where the cool of evening yields refreshment. Men and<br/>
women of the poorer class performed their prescribed<br/>
ablutions in the waters of the canal, and on the banks knelt<br/>
pious Moslems murmuring the appointed prayers with their<br/>
faces set towards Mecca.<br/>
<br/>
Among the well-dressed people one saw some <span style="color: #ff0000;">overshowy </span>toilettes, and much bad taste, but undeniably<br/>
