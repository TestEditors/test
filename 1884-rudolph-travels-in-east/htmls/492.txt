flowers gives the steppe the advantage in spring; the desert<br/>
can only show variety in its stones. Again a hill rises in<br/>
front, belonging to the so-called mountains of Judaea. It<br/>
has strayed away from the direction in which the rest are<br/>
seen, and advances into the plateau with its steep outlines<br/>
and its peculiar form and colour.<br/>
<br/>
The whole of this pointed cone is a conglomerate of<br/>
yellow clay, red rock, and brown and grey stones, and is<br/>
quite without plants. We had to pass through a deep<br/>
ravine between it and the other border mountains. It was<br/>
a <span style="color: #0000FF;">mauvais </span>pas-nothing but smooth stones and precipices<br/>
below. Our Bedouins themselves dismounted, and at<br/>
one place the horses could not even be led. The clever<br/>
animals followed their masters of their own accord. It is<br/>
at such times that one learns to value the great intelligence<br/>
of the Arab horse. A pack-horse fell to a great depth at<br/>
one of the bad places, but luckily came upon his back, with<br/>
the pack underneath him, and, wonderful to tell, escaped<br/>
with a few bruises.<br/>
<br/>
The ascent from the ravine was better than the descent,<br/>
and crossing a grassy plain we came along the northern<br/>
base of the hill to Nebi-Musa. This is a considerable<br/>
place of pilgrimage for Mohammedans, who here point out<br/>
the grave of Moses. A small half-ruined mosque and a<br/>
wretched house for pilgrims mark the place, which is<br/>
visited each year by thousands of devotees. During the<br/>
days sacred to the Prophet no Christian may venture into<br/>
the district; his life would not be safe.<br/>
<br/>
When we arrived there was no one there except the<br/>
Turkish family to whom the care of the shrine is <span style="color: #0000FF;">en<br/>
