<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">CONTRASTS</span>--EGYPT AND PALESTINE. 267<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ample spreading garments with broad gay sashes, big<br/>
turbans, and sometimes the fez; jackets or short <span style="color: #ff0000;">spencerlike </span>coats trimmed with fur; full knee-breeches, red slippers, sometimes sandals; such are the most striking points<br/>
of the dress you find on the Asiatic coast. Amongst the<br/>
genuine Asia Minorites who reside here, as well as among<br/>
the Druses, the costumes remind one of those of the<br/>
inhabitants of the Balkan peninsula.<br/>
<br/>
The women are <span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesquely </span>shrouded in wide dresses,<br/>
with white kerchiefs and veils, wholly different from the<br/>
Egyptian female dress. As many Christian and Jewish<br/>
women inhabit Jaffa, we saw a number of richly clad ladies<br/>
in the streets, most of them veiled slightly or not at all, so<br/>
that we could note many beautiful and indeed noble faces.<br/>
It was remarkable how many had dazzling white skins<br/>
combined with raven-black hair. On the whole, complexions are fair in Palestine, especially in the towns--sometimes yellowish, rarely brown. This last hue is only<br/>
met with among the free tribes, and chiefly among the<br/>
southern ones.<br/>
<br/>
The first sight of the gay and brightly clad throng was<br/>
very interesting, and we mounted the stairs slowly on our<br/>
way to the Latin hospice. Turkish soldiers in green<br/>
uniform, warlike-looking natives of Asia Minor, differing<br/>
in all respects from the Egyptians, kept a path open for us.<br/>
It was very necessary, for the people surrounded us with<br/>
the utmost inquisitiveness. Some aged Franciscans awaited<br/>
us at the door of the hospice. We passed into the church<br/>
through a house and up and down innumerable staircases.<br/>
The way was both difficult and dirty, and we had to pass<br/>
