<span>VISIT <span style="color: #0000FF;">TO </span>HELIOPOLIS<span style="color: #ff0000;">.</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">' </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">S</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span>reached <span style="color: #0000FF;">the</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>Tree of Mary," which stands among the thick<br/>
shrubberies and gardens. We halted, to look at the sycamore under which, the legend goes, the Holy Family<br/>
rested. It is a very old tree, remarkable for its knotted<br/>
branches, the size of its trunk, and the thickness of its bark,<br/>
and well repays the trouble of a visit.<br/>
<br/>
In the neighbourhood we made a vain attempt to hunt<br/>
a small sugar-cane plantation with our dogs, and had the<br/>
same ill-luck in a plantation of areca.<br/>
<br/>
The remainder of the way lay along high narrow dykes<br/>
---neck-breaking work with the heavy carriages-and we<br/>
approached our goal but slowly. On both sides of our<br/>
road lay the green tilled land, crossed by canals and ornamented with sycamores and rustling palm woods. Some<br/>
small grey-brown Arab villages, built of clay, were the only<br/>
human habitations, but all along the route the industrious<br/>
fellaheen worked in the fields.<br/>
<br/>
Buffaloes drew water at the wells, and camels <span style="color: #0000FF;">bare </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A<br/>
</span>loads; herons in thick flocks followed the countryman as<br/>
he drove the plough, and sundry birds rejoiced the eyes of<br/>
the sportsman. <span style="color: #ff0000;">To </span>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">south-east </span>we saw the desert and<br/>
its bare mountains. After some time the famous obelisk of<br/>
Heliopolis came in sight, surrounded with green meadows<br/>
and shrubs.<br/>
<br/>
Here, on this classic spot, I will avail myself of the<br/>
words of my friend Brugsch Pasha, which I take from a<br/>
letter addressed to me, in which the Egyptologist speaks<br/>
of Heliopolis: "When the traveller from Memphis in<br/>
ancient times had crossed the Nile and entered the <span style="color: #0000FF;">SO-</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">called </span>Holy Way, which leads on the east side of the<br/>
<br/>
