<span>FAREWELL TO THE EAST. 377<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
ported to the cradle of humanity where Paradise <span style="color: #0000FF;">stood</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the sacred, golden, glorious East.<br/>
<br/>
Descending by a narrow street of the little town of Haifa,<br/>
which is built in terraces on the steep slopes of Mount<br/>
Carmel, we soon reached the quay. One step more on<br/>
Eastern soil, one last look on the brightly coloured throng of<br/>
human life, and our hard parting from the East was over.<br/>
A boat from the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar </span>bore us over the swaying waters<br/>
to the ship which lay at anchor<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
