dry atmosphere. Returning from the mountains we shot<br/>
some quail, which had paused in the narrow meadow,<br/>
weary with their long journey.<br/>
<br/>
After a stoppage of scarcely two hours we went on<br/>
our further voyage. Towards two, the steamer arrived at<br/>
the large and <span style="color: #0000FF;">well-situated-town </span>of Sohag. We landed at<br/>
once to explore the neighbourhood.<br/>
<br/>
The Grand Duke and I went round the most distant<br/>
quarter of the town, by the barracks of the small garrison,<br/>
and sought by some large pools for various kinds of birds.<br/>
<br/>
The many lookers-on, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rocks </span>of buffaloes and<br/>
camels coming to water, drove us thence; and following<br/>
the dyke of the famous Canal of Joseph, we came past<br/>
scattered houses and flourishing fields and gardens to a<br/>
wood of high tamarisks, <span style="color: #ff0000;">sycamores</span>, and palms.<br/>
<br/>
This excellent cover served as a sleeping-place to great<br/>
numbers of birds; and soon after sundown we shot many<br/>
of the astonished slumberers. A dwarf eagle, several kites,<br/>
falcons, crows, two owls, and a lot of palm-doves became<br/>
our prey in the course of a few minutes.<br/>
<br/>
In the matter of landscape, too, this forest, consisting<br/>
solely of African trees, had many charms, and we left most<br/>
unwillingly the perfumed, rich, green shade, whose abounding vegetation recalled the glowing fancies of the "Arabian<br/>
Nights." Keeping along the dyke we <span style="color: #0000FF;">soon </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">teached </span>the<br/>
town, and riding through several narrow but busy streets<br/>
got back to our steamer.<br/>
<br/>
Mudir Ali Pasha had kindly lent me his large snowwhite donkey, named Abu-Gebel, a remarkably fine <span style="color: #0000FF;">specimen</span>, of purest Arab breed; and as I had been very <span style="color: #0000FF;">much<br/>
