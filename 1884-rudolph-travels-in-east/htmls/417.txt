Walking was not at all pleasant among the rocks,<br/>
blocks of stone, and almost impenetrable bushes with<br/>
their long thorns; and as no partridges were to be found,<br/>
and the large birds of prey which perpetually hovered<br/>
around would not let us approach them, we soon returned<br/>
to the caravan route. When we crossed the ridge the<br/>
country grew more desolate; even the shrubs gave place<br/>
to dry grass and the picturesque rocks to rubble. A<br/>
broad valley lay before us, and the road wound down to<br/>
it by serpentine paths.<br/>
<br/>
We passed some tumble-down inns for pilgrims which<br/>
stood in desolate, stony olive gardens, and vividly recalled<br/>

On the steep of the hill lies the village of the same name.<br/>
At the lowest point of the valley is a single-storied<br/>
European hotel for pilgrims. Palestine is, so long as<br/>
you keep on the regular line of march of pious caravans,<br/>
a regular land of tourists, a sort of religious Switzerland.<br/>
There the taste of the traveller for the beauties of<br/>
