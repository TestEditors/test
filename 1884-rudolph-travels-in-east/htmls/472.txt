<span>316 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
ran first eagerly into the burrow. Croat and Opeka, his<br/>
Croatian comrades, followed him. But few seconds had<br/>
passed when we heard the racket under the stones. I<br/>
thought at first it was a battle with the wounded animal,<br/>
but I was soon undeceived, and a glance into the funnel<br/>
showed me the efficiency of the brave dogs. They were<br/>
dragging the dead jackal with all their might into the light<br/>
of day.<br/>
<br/>
We now set off home across a most painfully cleft<br/>
ridge. I let the dogs search some caves, outside which<br/>
were fresh tracks of foxes, jackals, and in one case of a<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">hyaena</span>. These searches had unfortunately no result, and<br/>
the sun was scorching and the dogs tired quickly on the<br/>
hot stones.<br/>
<br/>
We soon reached the camp. A few hours' rest were<br/>
most welcome. Before sunset Waldburg and I climbed<br/>
about the slopes of the same valley in which we had made<br/>
a firing-place for jackals the evening before. A search<br/>
with the dogs, and our own diligent efforts to get up to an<br/>
old partridge cock which was tumbling about on the stones,<br/>
were alike unsuccessful, and we contented ourselves with<br/>
climbing the opposite slope, and reaching the highest point<br/>
of the ridge, in order to get the beautiful view towards the<br/>
mountains of the Dead Sea. We returned at nightfall to<br/>
the camp, where stillness soon settled on all, as a helpful<br/>
precursor of coming days of travel in the Valley of the<br/>
Jordan.<br/>
<br/>
There was a general stir in the camp early on the<br/>
morning of the 3rd. The tents were struck, and all the<br/>
baggage put on the pack-horses. Two more hyaenas <span style="color: #0000FF;">had<br/>
