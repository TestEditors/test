<span>AN ANCIENT INSCRIPTION. 133<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"The divine benefactor created by Ra (the sun) is<br/>
a great king from his birth up. Powerful as Horus on<br/>
the throne of his fathers, the strong-armed has none who<br/>
is his equal.<br/>
<br/>
"That is a king of a strong hand, whose bow no<br/>
man can span, neither among his warriors, nor among the<br/>
princes of the people, nor among the kings of Assyria,<br/>
for his strength is greater than that of all the kings.<br/>
<br/>
"In his wrath he is like the leopard. If he tread the<br/>
battlefield there is none that will meet him. Victorious<br/>
in battle he is a bulwark for Egypt. Strong in courage<br/>
he waits in the defile the hour of plunder.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>His adversaries flee before him, for his power is outstretched over all people, with their mighty men and horses,<br/>
and if his foes came in millions he need not fear the God<br/>
of whose path is Amon. If he is on an expedition forthwith man's strength takes possession of his body, and he<br/>
is like to the God Chim (Pan) in time of terror, and<br/>
no man can save himself from his arm. He had the<br/>
Semites to his adversaries, and the nine peoples of the same,<br/>
but all the peoples and the countries became his servants.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>They that hated the king have become subject to his<br/>
magic powers, yea to the very last of them. His hands<br/>
give wounds, and no arm can stay <span style="color: #0000FF;">him-only </span>in his breath<br/>
is life. The King of kings, the Prince of princes has<br/>
brought hither the inhabitants of the utmost ends of the<br/>
earth.<br/>
<br/>
"He is the only one, and a champion for those who<br/>
extol him and acknowledge him as a sun in the heavens.<br/>
<br/>
"His glance is terrible in the day of battle. No<br/>
<br/>
