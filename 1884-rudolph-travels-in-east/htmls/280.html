slabs of rock and rolling stones. To the right and left we<br/>
saw innumerable graves and funeral caves. The lower<br/>
declivities of the whole line of mountains to the west of<br/>
ancient Thebes are hollowed through and through with the<br/>
burying-places of centuries.<br/>
<br/>
A wolf sprang out of one of these hollows and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Bed </span>up<br/>
the slopes. The distance was, unfortunately, too considerable to allow of firing at him with small shot. We now<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>to climb over the ridge of the mountain by<br/>
different paths, in the hope of getting a shot.<br/>
<br/>
The ridge was soon surmounted, and a beautiful view<br/>
opened before us into the green Valley of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, upon<br/>
the great river, the town of Luxor, the ruins of Karnak,<br/>
and the Arabian mountains opposite-a wild assemblage of<br/>
peaks, points, ravines, valleys, cliffs, heaps of sand and<br/>
rubble, slabs of stone and blocks of limestone, all in<br/>
dazzling white or shades of yellow, without a vestige of<br/>
vegetation, glittering with the most brilliant reflections, and<br/>
scorched through by the rays of the African sun. One can<br/>
scarcely imagine a more grand and sombre picture of the<br/>
true desert mountain. In the sand I found the tracks of<br/>
hyaenas, wolves, and jackals, and innumerable burrows of<br/>
different wild animals. Vultures sat in the clefts of overshadowing rocks, and swifts floated above the desolate<br/>
mountain tops.<br/>
<br/>
A wolf ran across the path in front of me, but so far off<br/>
that my shot took no effect. The Grand Duke had no<br/>
better luck with a jackal. Following a narrow path, we<br/>
made a difficult descent into the principal valley, where, as<br/>
previously agreed, we were to meet the asses. We <span style="color: #0000FF;">rode<br/>
