<span>286 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We then inspected the adjacent large Franciscan Convent of St. Salvator. We looked at the church, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">refectory</span>, and some of the cells; but our visit was rather to the<br/>
monks, for there is not much worth seeing in this bare and<br/>
very poor convent. Our next visit was to the patriarch.<br/>
He received us in his house surrounded by his numerous<br/>
clergy. His abode is like those in the south, bare, with<br/>
little furniture, and here and there sporadic curtains. The<br/>
floors are <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ragged</span>, and the walls hung with religious<br/>
pictures of Italian art. The chapel, the court, and the<br/>
great staircase, are all very simple, and show how far from<br/>
rich are the princes of the Latin Church in the East.<br/>
<br/>
At the venerable <span style="color: #0000FF;">patriarch</span>'s also we had to follow the<br/>
horrible custom of the East and go through the process of<br/>
drinking, which is <span style="color: #0000FF;">de </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">vigueutr </span>at every visit. We began<br/>
with chocolate at the Franciscans; here we were condemned to stale lemonade and almond milk; and still<br/>
worse awaited us in the course of the morning.<br/>
<br/>
On the patriarch's <span style="color: #ff0000;">stepsa </span>female Christian of these parts<br/>
approached me in-pure Eastern, I had almost said-old<br/>
Hebrew dress, with a white kerchief on her head and<br/>
unveiled. She was a wonderful sight, with fine features,<br/>
splendid figure, and a pale complexion. One could imagine<br/>
nothing fitter for the model of a Magdalen. She handed<br/>
me a petition, and disappeared in the colonnade.<br/>
<br/>
We went along the narrow streets, which were full of<br/>
people, to the Syrian patriarch. Many pilgrims, trading<br/>
Moslems, and loathsome beggars were about. The patriarch received us in black robes at the entrance of the<br/>
church. His priests, on the other hand, all wore the <span style="color: #0000FF;">broad<br/>
