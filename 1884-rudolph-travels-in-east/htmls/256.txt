palms, till we reached a little plain, on whose bank lay some<br/>
boats. Some Nubian soldiers, in pure white uniforms, but<br/>
of European cut, stood on guard. For the first time we<br/>
enjoyed close at hand the memorable and enchanting sight.<br/>
The <span style="color: #0000FF;">lovely </span>island of Philae presents itself surrounded with<br/>
masses of dark-coloured rock which rise directly from the<br/>
water. A large, high boat, rowed by several Nubians<br/>
singing to keep time, took us across to the island.<br/>
<br/>
The boat might, so far as its antiquarian shape went,<br/>
quite well have dated from the time of Cleopatra. A<br/>
pavilion with soft couches, and red curtains to protect from<br/>
the sun, increased the droll appearance of this frigate of the<br/>
N <span style="color: #0000FF;">ile</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
<br/>
</span>In a few minutes we had reached the steep bank of the<br/>
island, and hastened across the slope, with its thick bushes,<br/>
towards the beautiful temple.<br/>
<br/>
The temple buildings of this holy island, known to the<br/>
old Egyptians as Pilak, are of comparatively recent date, for<br/>
they were built under the Ptolemies and the Romans, after<br/>
old models<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>The stone quays of the island are built with<br/>
a practical knowledge which bespeaks a thorough <span style="color: #0000FF;">ac<br/>
</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">quaintance </span>with river architecture, which, especially in the<br/>
neighbourhood of waterfalls, and with strong currents, is not<br/>
without difficulties.<br/>
<br/>
Though the sanctuaries of the island are on a somewhat<br/>
smaller scale, their whole effect, with their colonnades and<br/>
hypaethral buildings, amid the ruins of houses which<br/>
have fallen in, and palms and soft green bushes, is one of<br/>
indescribable beauty. The light surfaces of the temple<br/>
rise in wonderful contrast to the dark masses of rock<br/>
