sport, when Baron Saurma summoned us to him. He had<br/>
discovered a great sugar-cane plantation, and had resolved<br/>
to drive it with dogs. Our only difficulty was to get rid of<br/>
the numerous labourers, in order to secure a free range for<br/>
our guns. The gentlemen were to post themselves round<br/>
the field, and Saurma proposed to drive, with my huntsman<br/>
and the pack of fourteen dogs, through the canes, which<br/>
were the height of a man. We had not all got to our<br/>
places ere we heard the merry bark of the dogs, followed<br/>
by two shots. One of our party, rightly taking in the<br/>
situation, had hurried forward, hoping to be the first to<br/>
reach the further side of the field. He was still on his<br/>
way, when the dogs drove a large wolf within a few steps<br/>
of him into the open field. Unfortunately, through dire<br/>
ill-luck, the small shot destined for plover and heron was<br/>
still in the barrels, and, vainly fired at from both, Master<br/>
Isegrimm hastened across an open space to the nearest<br/>
cover.<br/>
<br/>
In a short time the dogs were driving with noisy barks<br/>
in all parts of the cane-field. Many shots were heard.<br/>
Two of the sportsmen had <span style="color: #0000FF;">fired </span>twice at wolves, but all in<br/>
vain, as the crafty beasts only left the canes for one or two<br/>
bounds, and again disappeared into them. Many shots<br/>
were <span style="color: #ff0000;">fired'at </span>the wolves on chance as they rushed through<br/>
the thick plantation. Frequently the <span style="color: #0000FF;">baying </span>of the dogs<br/>
and streaks of blood showed that some at least of the shots<br/>
had taken effect. Several of the gentlemen, overcome by<br/>
the ardour of the chase, left their posts and followed the<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">baying</span>; but among the canes it was impossible to see two<br/>
steps in front, and all their efforts were fruitless.<br/>
