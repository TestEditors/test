<span>VIEW FROM THE CITADEL. I3<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
One cannot drive to the top. The road ends abruptly<br/>
in some heaps of stones. The last part we did on foot.<br/>
<br/>
The hill was alive with soldiers; for here, too, a battalion<br/>
had been called out. The commandant, a cultivated man,<br/>
who had lived much in Paris, explained everything to us in<br/>
the purest French. The citadel proper is in ruins. The<br/>
troops are therefore placed in casemates and huts.<br/>
<br/>
The view from the citadel is very remarkable. To the<br/>
east, across the canal, is the Greek coast; at our feet lies<br/>
the town; along the southern side of the hill are luxuriant<br/>
gardens; on the western slope loam and yellow clay formations, which reminded me vividly of the mountains in the<br/>
vicinity of Murcia, in Spain. To the northward this hilltop<br/>
runs up to a range of wooded hills, which extend along<br/>
the east coast of the island, while the west coast is characterized by its high bare chain of hills. Between these,<br/>
along the centre of the island, is a broad depressed plain.<br/>
This is all separated from the southern point by a narrow<br/>
marshy strip of land, which begins close to the town.<br/>
The southern point is graced by Mount Skopo, an independent mountain mass, differing and apart from all the rest.<br/>
<br/>
We seemed unable to satisfy ourselves with gazing on<br/>
the splendid tableau before us, the variety of the mountains,<br/>
wooded hills, rich garden-landscape and prettily placed<br/>
villages, the town of Zante itself, the calm <span style="color: #0000FF;">light </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">blue<br/>
</span>waters of the canal, and beyond and across the isthmus,<br/>
the yet boisterous sea, made a combination of the most <span style="color: #0000FF;">impressive </span>kind. The view seemed even more magnificent<br/>
when heavy thunder clouds gathered over the mountains.<br/>
The wind <span style="color: #0000FF;">rose</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lightning </span>flashed, and thunder rolled, and,<br/>
<br/>
