<span>6 TRAVELS <span style="color: #0000FF;">IN </span>THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">T </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">here </span>are singularly few towns on the Albanian coast.<br/>
Here and there you catch sight of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flat-rooted</span>, brightly<br/>
coloured houses of a village built in steps on the declivity<br/>
and standing amidst gloomy cypresses and grey green olives.<br/>
<br/>
By noon the lovely Greek island of Corfu came in sight,<br/>
and to the west of it the rocky islets of Merlera and Fano.<br/>
The passage between Corfu and the mainland is unquestionably one of the most beautiful pieces of scenery known.<br/>
To the east the Albanian mountains stretch round the broad<br/>
basin and valley of Butrinto. In the midst of the valley a<br/>
fine mountain lake, surrounded by extensive forests of oak<br/>
and great marshes, contrasts with the bare limestone<br/>
mountains, whose lofty summits, soaring in the background,<br/>
are visible from afar.<br/>
<br/>
Westward, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. to the right, lies the green island, with<br/>
its beautifully formed hills, its proud Mount Decca, its<br/>
rustling oak and olive woods, its many cypresses and its<br/>
flowering fruit trees, and, scattered everywhere over the<br/>
whole island, dazzlingly white houses and villages. Truly,<br/>
a remarkable contrast-to the left, the wild uncultivated<br/>
Albania, inhabited by quarrelsome mountaineers; to the<br/>
right, the flowery Corfu, converted by the tractable, commerce-loving Greek into a luxuriant garden.<br/>
<br/>
We passed the bay of Ipsa, and both citadel and town<br/>
of Corfu came into view, well placed on the central and<br/>
salient promontory of the island.<br/>
<br/>
Whenever I see Corfu, Homer takes possession of my<br/>
thoughts, and fills them so long as the ship is passing<br/>
amongst these Ionian Islands. In younger days, when<br/>
reading the Odyssey, I formed a picture of these islands<br/>
