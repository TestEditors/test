<br/>
rich robes used at Mass, with capes such as one sees in the<br/>
earliest Christian pictures, and carried lighted torches. We<br/>
made a solemn entry into the church, between the priests<br/>
and choir-boys dressed like them, who chanted our National<br/>
Hymn in Syrian.<br/>
<br/>
The church itself resembles those of the Greeks. Like<br/>
them, it is rich in lavish expenditure of gold and silver;<br/>
but withal has certain peculiarities, and a special tomb for<br/>
the devotees of St. James. The altar is very much raised,<br/>
and in a side chapel beneath a stone rests the head of St.<br/>
James, who is venerated by them almost as a divinity.<br/>
The niche, with its relics, is, as a matter of course, most<br/>
richly adorned. Near the altar stands a high gilt throne,<br/>
which the priests pass with signs of the deepest veneration.<br/>
This is the seat of St. James, on which he is perpetually<br/>
throned--<span style="color: #0000FF;">but </span>of course <span style="color: #0000FF;">invisible</span>.<br/>
<br/>
There were many pilgrims in the church of this persuasion. By their look one might have taken them <span style="color: #0000FF;">for</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>Turks or <span style="color: #ff0000;">MosIems</span>.<br/>
<br/>
We moved in solemn procession from the church through<br/>
an open colonnade to the patriarch's house, which is so<br/>
simple in its appointments as to be almost uninhabitable.<br/>
It displays a sofa in one corner, and three melancholy<br/>
chairs in the others. The worthy old man received us<br/>
most cordially, and compelled us to swallow a perfectly<br/>
indescribable rose-coloured beverage.<br/>
<br/>
After a short visit we left for the Jewish quarter.<br/>
There are some bazaars in Jerusalem in the hands of the<br/>
Hebrews, and the residences of the chosen people are<br/>
grouped in a long street full of good shops. Dirt, effluvia,<br/>
<br/>
