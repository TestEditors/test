<br/>
</span>The idea of moving along between two quarters of the<br/>
globe is exciting; but one ends by getting used even to<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">imposing </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ideas</span>, and wearies of the tedious reality. Gigantic<br/>
flocks of pelicans and <span style="color: #0000FF;">flamingoes </span>stood by thousands and<br/>
thousands on the marshy southern parts of Lake Menzaleh.<br/>
We fired across at them, but with no other effect than that<br/>
of raising a living cloud larger than it is possible to conceive.<br/>
<br/>
After the lake on our right had come to an end, the<br/>
surroundings were desolate indeed. The high banks shut<br/>
out all view, and earthworks right and left, however well<br/>
constructed, did not present a cheerful picture.<br/>
<br/>
The only variety was meeting with a large English<br/>
Indiaman, which had awkwardly got athwart the canal<br/>
and blocked the way. Our captain thought we could pass,<br/>
and went boldly on. A severe wrench and some small<br/>
damage to our ship's sides, and there we were caught by<br/>
our English neighbour. We toiled for half an hour to get<br/>
free. The rough English captain kept his back turned<br/>
to us, as though the matter did not in the least <span style="color: #0000FF;">concern</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>him. At last there was a slight move, a creaking and<br/>
groaning of the jammed vessels, another wrench, and we<br/>
were free. We had floated the English vessel too by the<br/>
shock, and so each ship went her opposite way.<br/>
<br/>
Later we got every now and then, from the captain's<br/>
bridge, a view over the bank across the Arabian desert,<br/>
the character of which is totally different from that of the<br/>
Libyan one. It is all much lighter, almost white, stone<br/>
as well as sand; flatter too, at most waving in gentle<br/>
sandhills; the numerous small, round, dark-green shrubs<br/>
also give it a peculiar aspect.<br/>
