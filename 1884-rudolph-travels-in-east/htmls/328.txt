<br/>
WE drove from the station through the beautiful avenue of<br/>
<br/>
trees, across the great Nile bridge, into the ancient City<br/>
<br/>
of the Caliphs, whose streets at this hour, late in the<br/>
afternoon, were full of life.<br/>
<br/>
Carriages and horsemen, swift-footed runners, Western<br/>
bustle and activity by the side of caravans of camels,<br/>
veiled fellaheen women, braying asses, water-carriers, and<br/>
blind beggars-all this glides rapidly past, and glad were<br/>
we again to enjoy the life of Cairo. Through the European<br/>
quarter and over the canal bridge, we soon reached the<br/>
Shubra Avenue and our own' Kasr-en-Nusha.<br/>
<br/>
After a bath and dinner the magic of African moonlight tempted some of us out, and we drove in hired<br/>
carriages into the town.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped at the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Esbekiy√© </span>Garden, and went through<br/>
the balmy plantations, by the pond, and round amongst the<br/>
artificial waterfalls, rocks, and kiosks. People were sitting<br/>
at most of the restaurants-chiefly Levantines belonging to<br/>
the commercial classes-young men passing the time in<br/>
drinking, listening to music, or playing at cards.<br/>
