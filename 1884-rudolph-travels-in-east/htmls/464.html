<span>308 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

<br/>
to protect the holy places from invasion by the Arab<br/>
tribes, whose abodes are not very remote, and who are<br/>
quite lawless. The church, with its chapels and halls, bears<br/>
the character of the earliest Christian, i.e. Byzantine, times.<br/>
Unhappily many of the most ancient mosaics and paintings<br/>
are effaced or have fallen off, and the statues are broken.<br/>
The church, too, is not well kept up as a whole. One sees<br/>
at every turn in its interior the results of the compromise<br/>
between the three rites. Altars, fonts, and shrines of the<br/>
different religions stand close beside each other. Franciscans and Greek priests walk about in numbers. Few<br/>
pilgrims, and they chiefly Russian peasants, were there on<br/>
this occasion; but all the more inhabitants, as the town is<br/>
Christian, followed us in our rounds, among them the<br/>
most beautiful and picturesque figures which fancy can<br/>

<br/>
The most interesting parts are the subterranean grottoes.<br/>
We reached the brightly lighted Chapel of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nativity </span>by<br/>
a flight of steps, and through doors from the church. In a<br/>
niche to the east is an altar; beneath it a silver star is let<br/>
into the ground, and round it are the words, "Hic de<br/>
Virgine Maria Jesus Christus natus est."<br/>
<br/>
The narrow, gloomy chamber makes a great impression<br/>
on the pilgrim, and ancient mysticism, the weight of <span style="color: #0000FF;">tradition</span>, and the conviction that here Christianity was born,,<br/>
and that from hence went forth that religion which has<br/>
changed the face of the world, stirs solemn and sublime<br/>
emotions. Unbidden he falls on his knees and kisses the<br/>
stone which thousands of <span style="color: #0000FF;">lips </span>have pressed in the lapse of<br/>
ages, breathing vows of fidelity with pious <span style="color: #ff0000;">fervour</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
