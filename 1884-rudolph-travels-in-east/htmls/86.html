rituals. The women wore the old Eastern dress, like that<br/>
of the Oriental female Christians, of which we were afterwards to see so much in the Holy Land. The Coptic<br/>
women were shrouded in white veils, like the Mohammedans. Mass was said by the Court Chaplain. At its<br/>
close, we took leave of the representatives of this most<br/>
interesting religious body, and proceeded thoroughly to<br/>
explore the Arab quarters.<br/>
<br/>
The old Oriental part of Cairo is a picture rich in<br/>
colour, effect, and interest, such as only the East can offer.<br/>
Much space, minute study, and special work would be<br/>
required to record its characteristics accurately and fully.<br/>
I must, therefore, on the present occasion, confine myself<br/>
to the leading points which struck me.<br/>
<br/>
We made our way amongst shops, bazaars, coffeehouses-the teeming tumult of Arab life-to reach the<br/>
ancient and historically most interesting mosque, which<br/>

clay, with bewitching bow-windows, or the gratings of the<br/>
harem, and all the scrolls and decorations of Arabian<br/>
architecture, are a wonderful medley to look upon. Nothing<br/>
is symmetrical, while everything is picturesque. Even<br/>
decay, with its touch of impending ruin, gives to the picture<br/>
the impress of its genuine Oriental characteristics.<br/>
<br/>
We entered first the court of the large and handsome<br/>
Mosque <span style="color: #ff0000;">Gama-el-Hhssantn</span>, built in honour of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hassan<br/>
</span>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hussén</span>, the sons of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ali</span>, son-in-law of the Prophet.<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Hussén </span>fell A.D. 680, at the battle of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kerbila</span>. His head <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/>
