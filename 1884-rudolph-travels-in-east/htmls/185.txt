<span>A MOSLEM SAINT. 109<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The steamer stopped, and a boat approached. I asked<br/>
what it meant, and learnt to my no small surprise that'<br/>
among these bare desert mountains, in a keep high above<br/>
the Nile, dwells a Moslem saint, a so-called Sheik, who<br/>
claims a toll. The vessel which should pass by regardless<br/>
of this due, is sure, according to popular belief, to be shipwrecked on its way. The honest skipper who pays is<br/>
attended on his voyage by the pious prayers of the saintly<br/>
beggar.<br/>
<br/>
We now passed in quick succession the towns of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tachta</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Faubhs</span>, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Shidawin</span>, and the beautifully situated<br/>
large town of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sohhgr</span>, with its picturesque houses and<br/>
minarets.<br/>
<br/>
One lovely picture follows another; magnificent mountains with steep cliffs pass, to give place to palm forests and<br/>
motley towns. Smoking comfortably, talking, or reading,<br/>
one sits upon deck enjoying the pure air cooled by the river,<br/>
the balmy <span style="color: #ff0000;">odours </span>of African vegetation, and the beneficent.<br/>
sunbeams. From time to time a shot is fired at waterbirds in the distance, but almost always without <span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">effect</span>. It<br/>
is an indolent life, but interesting and instructive.<br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon we passed the <span style="color: #ff0000;">considerable </span>town of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">El-Achmim</span>, standing amongst palm-trees, and in the<br/>
evening the beautiful and wealthy town of Girgeh opened<br/>
on our view, well placed as it is on a high bank above the<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>, at a sharp turn of the river.<br/>
<br/>
A fine sunset gilded the landscape. Everything, mountain, stream, wood, town, and fields, was bathed in a wealth<br/>
<br/>
of colour, the effect and power of which it is impossible to<br/>
describe.<br/>
