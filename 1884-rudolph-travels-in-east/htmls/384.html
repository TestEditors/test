</span>vegetation became sandy wilds and unfruitful deserts. The<br/>
waters of inundation which had chiefly filled the Pelusian<br/>
branch were now borne to the western side of the Delta,<br/>
and the Canopic branch became a powerful stream. The<br/>
city of Alexandria, built in the neighbourhood of its mouth,<br/>
attracted to itself the commerce of the world under the<br/>
Ptolemies and the Romans, and raised itself into the<br/>
centre of all intellectual progress in religion, philosophy,<br/>
and literature. Its ancient importance has increased in our<br/>
day, at least in the matter of commerce. The cutting of<br/>
the Isthmus of Suez has, it is true, tied up one of its main<br/>
arteries; but the apprehension so often expressed, that<br/>
Port Said would one day take the place of Alexandria, is<br/>
nevertheless quite unfounded.<br/>
<br/>
"The favourable position of Alexandria to the west,<br/>
which admits of quicker intercourse with European ports<br/>
than Port Said can offer, its immediate vicinity to the now<br/>
cultivated parts of Lower Egypt, its waterways and railways, its markets and exchanges, and generally its provision<br/>
for the comfort of life, convince us that, in spite of all<br/>
difficulties of access to the harbour, Alexandria must be<br/>
regarded as the one important commercial town in the<br/>
future of Egypt.<br/>
<br/>
"Port Said could only acquire a like position if the<br/>
adjacent <span style="color: #0000FF;">continent</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span>Asia were to enter into a commercial<br/>
competition with Europe-a prospect which must lie in a<br/>
very remote future. The Isthmus of Suez is historically<br/>
extinct. Its importance was in a past whose last trace the<br/>
desert has entombed in sand. The passage of the canal<br/>
offers no special interest. The number of <span style="color: #ff0000;">kilometres<br/>
