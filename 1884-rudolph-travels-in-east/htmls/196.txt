<br/>
quickly led a sheep to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">spot</span>, stabbed it, disembowelled<br/>
it as a first dainty morsel for the vultures, and hastened<br/>
back to my companions at the temple.<br/>
<br/>
After we had thoroughly examined all the monuments,<br/>
we eat the breakfast we had brought with us in one of<br/>
the ancient halls. Our meal was scarcely finished before<br/>
Hoyos and I were again under way to pay a visit to<br/>
the dead sheep. We had not quite come within firing<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">distance </span>when a very cautious vulture perceived our<br/>
approach, and with a rushing flap of his wings, rose<br/>
from the ground. At least twenty of his unwieldly<br/>
comrades followed him. Hoyos was so fortunate as to<br/>
bring down a large white-headed vulture from among<br/>
the mass. I was less skilful, and only hit a very large<br/>
specimen, which, badly wounded, flew low across the plain.<br/>
The ravenous creatures had severely handled the poor<br/>
sheep; only his fleece and some mutilated morsels<br/>
remained.<br/>
<br/>
After this hunting intermezzo was over, we returned<br/>
to the other gentlemen, and went with them towards<br/>
the village, where we paid a visit to a blind peasant.<br/>
This worthy man is one of the wealthiest householders<br/>
of the place, and carries on besides a traffic in Egyptian<br/>
antiquities, which he, in defiance of law, has dug up<br/>
in and around the temples. Under Brugsch Pasha's<br/>
directions we bought some of the better things, and had<br/>
at the same time the opportunity of noticing the very<br/>
primitive, not to say dirty, arrangements of the abode<br/>
of a denizen of the Valley of the Nile.<br/>
<br/>
From <span style="color: #ff0000;">Arrtbat-el-Madfune </span>we rode back across country<br/>
