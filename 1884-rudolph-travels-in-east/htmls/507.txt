He seemed the impersonation of those recollections of<br/>
Scripture stories, familiar from early childhood, to which I<br/>
alluded as crowding on my mind on first entering the Holy<br/>
Land-the lineal representative of the prophets and rulers<br/>
of patriarchal times, or those later wise men who brought<br/>
their offerings to the infant Christ in His cradle, and must<br/>
have looked as did Sheik Ali when he stood before us in<br/>
flesh and blood, the living embodiment of a thousand years<br/>
which had brought no change.<br/>
<br/>
Again I was impressed by the absolutely stationary<br/>
aspect of life in these regions. Tents have not been<br/>
replaced by towns, nor has civilization, under the guise of<br/>
improvement, shackled the existence or changed the<br/>
character of these children of the desert, who still move<br/>
free and uncontrolled over the <span style="color: #ff0000;">steppes </span>and mountains.<br/>
The pride of <span style="color: #ff0000;">their-chiefs </span>still consists in a pastoral wealth<br/>
of flocks and herds, and in the martial resources furnished<br/>
by a thousand valiant combatants on swift coursers. The<br/>
regions over which they roam have no boundaries. The<br/>
plots of pasture ground determine the places where their<br/>
tents shall be pitched.<br/>
<br/>
I was glad to see this (in his own way) mighty<br/>
monarch, and thankful to understand by this meeting<br/>
that the Turkish authorities had placed us, with friendly<br/>
urgency, under his protection. And this protection is<br/>
absolutely indispensable for a journey beyond the Jordan;<br/>
for the river is the frontier, and from it to Bagdad is the<br/>
free territory of lawless tribes. No Caliph is acknowledged;<br/>
they feel themselves nearer to Mecca than to the Osman,<br/>
and no one would dare to force his way with arms along<br/>
