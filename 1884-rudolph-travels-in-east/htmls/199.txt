<br/>
</span>to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Belianeh</span>, hunting as we went. Sundry small creatures<br/>
were shot. We were especially interested by the Glide<br/>
eagle-an African bird of prey with blue and white plumage,<br/>
which frequents in considerable numbers the palm-groves<br/>
and <span style="color: #0000FF;">draw-wells</span>.<br/>
<br/>
In the afternoon we returned to the steamer, and were<br/>
able to pursue our course up the stream for two hours<br/>
before darkness set in. There was little variety in the<br/>
view, but the fine evening and a beautiful sunset furnished<br/>
us not only with glowing effects of colour, but also<br/>
with the opportunity of making some interesting <span style="color: #0000FF;">ethnographical </span>observations. At sun-down the fellaheen<br/>
drive their camels, buffaloes, asses, goats, and flocks to<br/>
drink for the last time. The population crowds to the<br/>
river bank: men and women perform, in the manner<br/>
handed down from past ages, the rites of washing<br/>
enjoined in the Koran; the graceful female <span style="color: #ff0000;">waterbearers </span>draw in clay pitchers, which have remained <span style="color: #0000FF;">un</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"<br/>
</span>changed in form and material since the days of the<br/>
Pharaohs, fresh Nile water for evening use; the thin blue<br/>
skirts which have dipped in the stream cling to their<br/>
figures and reveal their elegant outlines. Their large<br/>
black eyes gaze sadly into the curling wave, and their<br/>
partly <span style="color: #ff0000;">operied </span>mouths breathe melancholy songs. These<br/>
are the very same people whom we saw pictured<br/>
on the walls of the temples, and to us it seems as<br/>
though the graves must have opened to allow the<br/>
subjects of the Pharaohs to return to the banks of the<br/>
holy river.<br/>
<br/>
We lay to at a small village, and after a <span style="color: #0000FF;">pleasant<br/>
