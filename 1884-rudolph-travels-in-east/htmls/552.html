the verdure of the bottom of the vale gave promise of sport<br/>
such as we had in our last days in the Valley of the Jordan<br/>
with Salim. We discovered, however, after many fruitless<br/>
attempts, that neither the Bedouins nor their dogs would<br/>
penetrate into the thick underwood, so we undertook a long<br/>
expedition across the steppe to a morass described by the<br/>
sheik as excellent for our purpose. In the grass of the<br/>
steppe we first put up some quail and then a flock of<br/>
plover. The nearer we came to the morass, which could be<br/>
seen a long way off, the thicker grew. the bushes; from<br/>
among them sprang out two remarkable little creatures--smaller than deer, of yellowish colour, with horns like a roe,<br/>
and with the springing movements and long brush of the<br/>
fallow-deer. They <span style="color: #0000FF;">were </span>unfortunately too far off to allow<br/>
us to have a fair shot at them. The edges of the morass<br/>
were covered with marshy spots and the tall moist green<br/>
sword-grass. We shot on this wet ground some beautifully<br/>
coloured <span style="color: #ff0000;">frankolin </span>cocks and one female bird in its sober<br/>
suit of brown, not unlike that of the hen pheasant.<br/>
<br/>
The Grand Duke was now <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>to the further<br/>
side of this forest of pale yellow reeds, while the Bedouins<br/>
and I <span style="color: #ff0000;">endeavoured </span>from our side to penetrate its interior.<br/>
Reeds and sedge of more than man's height met over our<br/>
heads, and we waded knee-deep in marsh and mire and in<br/>
the decaying matter of the plants. After long walking over<br/>
this loathsome ground, which swarmed with toads, I reached<br/>
a clearing where, standing in the water, I was, at the bidding<br/>
of the Bedouins, to await the further course of the chase.<br/>
Myriads of disgusting marsh insects:, buzzed around me, and<br/>
it was in truth a spot so unpleasant as not to be <span style="color: #0000FF;">easily<br/>
<br/>
