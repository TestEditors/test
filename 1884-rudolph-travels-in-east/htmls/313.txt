<br/>
</span>interment was arranged at great expense, and its carcase,<br/>
well embalmed and adorned with rich decorations, was<br/>
borne on a car to the place of the Apis graves."<br/>
<br/>
We rode from Memphis, beyond the cultivated land, up<br/>
into the great Libyan desert, to the Pyramids of Sakkara,<br/>
and past Mariette's house to the Apis tombs.<br/>
<br/>
The country here has exactly the same character as<br/>
that at the Pyramids of Ghizeh. These Pyramids can be<br/>
seen from those of Sakkara, as well as Cairo, its citadel,<br/>
and the terraced forms of the Mokattam mountains.<br/>
<br/>
We penetrated, provided with torches, into the subterranean labyrinth of passages of the Apis tombs. They<br/>
seemed interminable, and the air was dry and oppressive.<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span>In the most brilliant period of Egyptian history, as also<br/>
later, under the foreign <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ptolemean </span>princes, the bulls were<br/>
placed in gigantic sarcophagi of the hardest stone, and<br/>
laid in separate compartments of the underground galleries.<br/>
They are placed in chronological order one after the other,<br/>
each grave having its own inscription. The Apis tombs<br/>
of Memphis, which are now made accessible to strangers<br/>
in the most convenient way, contain twenty-four of these<br/>
colossal sarcophagi. The series of bulls buried here began<br/>
with the middle of the sixteenth century <span style="color: #0000FF;">B.C.</span>, and closed at<br/>
the time of the Emperor Augustus.<br/>
<br/>
"The animals which lived before that period found<br/>
resting-places after death in the terraced Pyramid of Sakkara. In its interior there is a large vaulted space with<br/>
separate passages and niches. The bones of bulls which<br/>
<br/>
remain in them distinctly indicate the purpose of this<br/>
Pyramid."<br/>
