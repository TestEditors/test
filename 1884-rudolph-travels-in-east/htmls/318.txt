the ground, those that remain are amply sufficient to enable<br/>
us to form a <span style="color: #ff0000;">correctjudgment </span>as to their style of building,<br/>
and the mode of its execution. The grave-chamber has<br/>
mostly a pointed roof formed by two limestone monoliths,<br/>
which lean'against each other, sloping upwards. This<br/>
must be regarded as the essential point of every pyramid.<br/>
The covering of limestone blocks piled over it takes the<br/>
form of a pyramid. The angles of a pyramid were called<br/>
in old Egyptian Pir-am-us; hence the Greek name Pyramis.<br/>
<br/>
The pyramid was added to according to the length of<br/>
the reign of the Pharaoh who built it, so that with <span style="color: #0000FF;">his</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>advancing age the pyramid grew likewise. The different<br/>
heights of the Pyramids represent, therefore, the length of<br/>
the reigns of their royal founders, while their local arrangement following each other from north to south presents to<br/>
the eye of the spectator their chronological order also.<br/>
<br/>
The entrance to the Pyramids is always turned to the<br/>
north. The door is blocked by a drop-stone of granite;<br/>
an oblique and then a level passage terminates in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">gravechamber </span>itself, in which the mummies of the Pharaohs lie<br/>
on the western side in a sarcophagus which is usually of<br/>
granite. The stair-like shelves of the Pyramids were filled<br/>
with stone blocks polished on the outside, and when fitted<br/>
together appeared as a smooth surface, which presented<br/>
itself in triangular form from the base to the point as a<br/>
complete whole.<br/>
<br/>
The greater number of the Pyramids had been opened<br/>
in early time by <span style="color: #0000FF;">treasure-seekers</span>. The Persians under<br/>
Cambyses, the Romans, the Arabian Caliphs, have all<br/>
sought for buried treasure. In our days the attempt has<br/>
