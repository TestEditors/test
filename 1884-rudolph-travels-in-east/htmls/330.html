<span>204 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
From thence the crowd moved towards the upper part<br/>
of the street, where <span style="color: #0000FF;">serpent-char-s</span>, conjurers, ropedancers, dancing women, and similar performers had<br/>
improvised in the open street an Eastern fair.<br/>
<br/>
Brugsch Pasha, who accompanied us on this occasion,<br/>
dissuaded us from going in our European dress into the<br/>
mosque, which at that hour was thronged by religious<br/>
fanatics; so we pushed our way to the shows and jugglers,<br/>
where we could watch the genuine national life of the<br/>
people. The street is a gentle; ascent, so we could obtain<br/>
from the top a survey of the whole medley, the strange<br/>

we saw rich and poor Levantines in European dress, but<br/>
with the fez on their heads, playing at billiards, engaged at<br/>
the card table, or listening to the band.<br/>
<br/>
Next morning we paid a visit to the Viceroy, to thank<br/>
him for the great hospitality we had received on our<br/>
voyage up the Nile. This was no official visit, so we<br/>
drove quietly in the forenoon through the still empty streets<br/>
to the palace. We spent a quarter of an hour with the<br/>
Khedive, drinking the customary coffee, and smoking<br/>
excellent cigarettes. He inquired with much interest<br/>
about our experiences on our delightful Nile voyage.<br/>
<br/>
We returned from the palace by the shortest road to<br/>
