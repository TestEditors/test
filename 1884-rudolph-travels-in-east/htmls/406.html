<span>264 <span style="color: #0000FF;">TRAVELS </span>IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
During our transit the sea was like glass, and we<br/>
reached without hindrance the stairs of the little harbour<br/>
of Jaffa, which is only adapted for small craft.<br/>
<br/>
Here a new country met us, wholly diverse, more<br/>
genuinely Eastern, and richer in colour than Egypt.<br/>
Everything was novel to me. The pure Asiatic East<br/>
was before me for the first time. The town is built<br/>
in terraces up a hill. The lower houses, like the rocks<br/>
which project between them, are washed by the sea waves.<br/>
The Arab quarters built of clay have vanished; the<br/>
crumbling wood carving of the cities of the Nile, the<br/>
brown earth-coloured walls, the flat roofs-all these we<br/>
have left behind in Africa. The stone structures of the<br/>
rich <span style="color: #ff0000;">-Asiatic </span>East, much mixed with simple Hebrew<br/>
reminiscences of the Holy Land, present themselves to<br/>
us in the form of solid buildings with round cupolas in<br/>
the roofs, flat terraces, gloomy arched gateways, all built<br/>
in grey square stones without mortar or plaster.<br/>
<br/>
The first step on the soil of the Holy Land recalls<br/>
in the towns the memories of the orderly rule of the<br/>
Jewish kingdom, of the wise King Solomon, or of the<br/>
days when Jesus sat in the midst of His apostles teaching<br/>
on the stone steps of the open square; and in the<br/>
country images pass before the mind's eye which played<br/>
around us while we read the Scriptures in childhood.<br/>
The patriarch Abraham, the nomad king, rich in flocks,<br/>
handsome horses, fine tents, and fair women, the wise<br/>
and learned old man, the sage of mystic speech yet full<br/>
of practical wisdom, the father of a noble race, could<br/>
have existed only in the East, dwelt only in this land<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
