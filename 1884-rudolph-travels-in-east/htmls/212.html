great hall of the temple, supported by 134 pillars, whose<br/>
sculpture and decoration recall the finished style of the<br/>
temple of Abydus. On the northern external wall the<br/>
scenes depicted from the wars of the king with the Arabian<br/>
and Syrian people, as well as the representation of his<br/>
return to Egypt, are of the highest historical value. (3)<br/>
Ramses II. (Sesostris), completed the corridor of pillars<br/>
just mentioned after the death of his father and predecessor, Seti I. On the southern external wall are recorded<br/>
the illustrated descriptions of the battles of this Pharaoh<br/>
with the King of Heth and his Asiatic allies.<br/>
<br/>
"Of the smaller buildings the most noticeable are<br/>
the edifices and inscriptions of the so-called hall of<br/>
Bubastis (966 to 800 B.C.), as on its external wall the<br/>
king, Shashank I. (the King Shishak of the Bible),<br/>
has immortalized his campaign against the realm of Judah<br/>
from an Egyptian point of view. To the south of the<br/>
great temple of Karnak, in the direction of the river,<br/>
lies the fairly preserved temple of the lunar god <span style="color: #ff0000;">Chousu </span>(a<br/>
son of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, and of his divine consort, Mut), a work of<br/>
King Ramses III. (1200 <span style="color: #0000FF;">13.0</span>.), with an imposing Pylon<br/>
(gate) in front of it from the days of the Ptolemies. The<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Chousu </span>temple also marks the fall of the last of the<br/>
Pharaohs of the house of Ramses. The high priests of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">Amen</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Hirhor </span>at their head, obtained political supremacy<br/>
in Thebes, and put themselves in the place of the legitimate<br/>
kings. With this the glory of Thebes came to an end, and<br/>
a period of contest and civil war commenced.<br/>
<br/>
"A special sanctuary, in a southern direction from<br/>
Karnak, was also dedicated to Mut, the wife of Amon, <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/>
