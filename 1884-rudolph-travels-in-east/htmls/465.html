<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Three steps lower down is the Chapel of the Cradle,<br/>
where, according to tradition, the cradle of the child Jesus<br/>
stood, and opposite to it the spot is shown where the three<br/>
wise men of the East sank on their knees, paying homage<br/>
to the Divine child. <span style="color: #0000FF;">li</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>an underground passage we came<br/>
to a hole in the naked rock, from which a spring burst<br/>
forth for the use of the holy family; a door led into another<br/>
passage, where we were shown the spot at which Joseph<br/>
received the command to flee into Egypt; and yet further<br/>
down is the cave-like Chapel of the Innocents, where<br/>
Herod had the babes massacred who had been hidden by<br/>
their mothers.<br/>
<br/>
Our way next took us to the altar and grave of St.<br/>
Eusebius of Cremona, a pupil of St. Jerome. The grave<br/>
of this Father of the Church is close at hand, and we were<br/>
shown further on the chapel hewn in the rock, in which the<br/>
saint lived and where he wrote. This was the last of the<br/>
underground chambers, and we ascended by a staircase<br/>
through the Church of St. Catherine into the Latin convent.<br/>
It is a simple but well-kept building. The Franciscans<br/>
regaled us in the refectory with sundry sweet liqueurs.<br/>
After a short stay the Greek bishop, a man in the prime of<br/>
life, with a long black beard and handsome features, a<br/>
thorough Greek, courteous and graceful, invited us in most<br/>
elegant phrases to visit his convent.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">It </span>is a plain building, inhabited by monks of the order of<br/>
St. Basil, and most orthodox in its arrangements, which differ<br/>
a good deal from those of the Latin rite. We took our seats<br/>
in a bare and uninhabitable room, from which, however,<br/>
there was a fine view over the town and the surrounding<br/>
<br/>
