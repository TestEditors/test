They are both obliged to hoist their supplies of meat and<br/>
drink in baskets through the windows. <span style="color: #0000FF;">N </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">ear </span>the quarters<br/>
of these ecclesiastical guards galleries lead round inside the<br/>
church, from which the clergy on patrol can overlook the<br/>
whole interior.<br/>
<br/>
We descended from the convent into the church, and<br/>
examined the various shrines and historical points, as well<br/>
as all the side chapels and places with which legends or<br/>
dogmas are connected. One gathers a rich store of interesting recollections and ideas there. It is easy to see that<br/>
the different buildings date from very different epochs, and<br/>
many characteristic reminiscences of the Middle Ages are<br/>
to be met with. Individual chapels and shrines-of which<br/>
there are a great <span style="color: #ff0000;">number-vary </span>in type according to their<br/>
owners. Some are quite Latin; others Armenian, Syrian,<br/>
or Coptic. By far the most numerous are the orthodox<br/>
Greek, brilliant with gold and silver, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">overladen </span>with<br/>
dark Byzantine pictures of saints.<br/>
<br/>
To describe the Church of the Sepulchre in all its<br/>
detail would be a long task needing preparatory study.<br/>
Moreover, fairly minute and accurate descriptions are to be<br/>
found by those who need them in many of the hand-books.<br/>
I limit myself, therefore, to recording impressions and<br/>
scenes <span style="color: #0000FF;">stamped </span>vividly on my memory.<br/>
<br/>
Upstairs and downstairs, often over the most irregular<br/>
pavement, we roamed round the whole church-not a<br/>
corner was there which I did not visit. Everywhere, but<br/>
especially at the Greek shrines, we saw numbers of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Russian<br/>
</span>pilgrims crossing themselves perpetually between their<br/>
prostrations.<br/>
