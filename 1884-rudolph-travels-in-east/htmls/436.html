</span>290 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

<br/>
legends<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>They say this stone floats unsupported over<br/>
an abyss; and, to show this, the traveller is taken into a<br/>
.hollow space beneath the temple, where he sees the remains<br/>
of old walls of Jewish times. The Mohammedans also show<br/>
the praying-places of David, Solomon, Abraham, and Elias;<br/>
and here Mohammed has left the impress of his head.<br/>
<br/>
To recount all the myths connected with this most<br/>
important spot in the story of Asiatic creeds would be a<br/>
toilsome task; but to show how all the creeds which have<br/>
originated in the East hang together, we may mention that,<br/>
according to the Mohammedans, this rock is the spot where<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>the last day the throne of God will be set up, and<br/>
hither will the Kaba of Mecca come to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sachra</span>, for here<br/>
the trumpets will resound which open the judgment. In<br/>
the first days of Mohammedanism this place was almost as<br/>
important as Mecca, to which it but gradually yielded<br/>
priority. From this stone Mohammed ascended to heaven,<br/>
and the archangel Gabriel had to hold the stone back,<br/>
as it was inclined to soar after the Prophet. The hair of<br/>
Mohammed's beard, his banner, and that of Omar, and the<br/>
shield of Omar's uncle Hamsa, were shown us here, together<br/>
with some beautiful old Korans. We also noted mosaics<br/>
of great importance in the history of art, some fine glass<br/>
windows, and various architectural treasures, which we have<br/>
not space to record here.<br/>
<br/>
Mention must, however, be made of the old <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kufish<br/>
</span>inscriptions. The verses of the Koran which, from a<br/>
Mohammedan point of view, refer to Christ, are <span style="color: #0000FF;">preserved<br/>
</span>on the walls in beautiful writing. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Silr</span>. xvii. 3<span style="color: #ff0000;">: </span>"Praise <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/>
