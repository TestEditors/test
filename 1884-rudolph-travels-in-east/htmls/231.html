</span>divans, smoked pleasantly, and drank coffee, and the first<br/>
civilities were scarcely over when the doors opened and<br/>
light-footed maidens came in to dance to appropriate music.<br/>
The girls here were not beautiful; only one, an<br/>
Abyssinian, had well-marked features and a dazzling<br/>
brownish-black complexion. After a short stay we took<br/>
leave of the Mudir and returned to the steamer.<br/>
<br/>
We began our journey very early on the 6th of March,<br/>
and soon reached the <span style="color: #0000FF;">defile </span>of El-Kab, a beautiful district<br/>
where the mountains on each side advance to the river in<br/>
wild and romantic outline.<br/>
<br/>
After this narrow passage the Libyan desert retreats,<br/>
giving place to the broad and well-cultivated plain of<br/>
Edfu, while the Arabian mountains still continue to skirt<br/>
the <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ile</span>. The character of the mountains also changes:<br/>
instead of lofty shapely hills come wild shattered sandstone mountains whose low summits and peaks assume<br/>
most peculiar shapes.<br/>
<br/>
In the forenoon the vessel reached Edfu. We rode<br/>
across some fields to the very poor village hard by, and<br/>
through its dirty narrow streets to where, on its further<br/>
side, amidst heaps of ruin and rubbish, stands the<br/>
best-preserved temple of Upper Egypt and one of the<br/>
finest pieces of architecture of all time.<br/>
<br/>
We at once began our inspection of the building under<br/>
Brugsch Pasha's guidance. Edfu is the old Egyptian<br/>
Debu or <span style="color: #ff0000;">Edbu</span>, in Greek "Apollonopolis" the Great.<br/>
The temple of Edfu, justly accounted one of the greatest<br/>
and most extensive sanctuaries, has existed from antiquity<br/>
to the present day in wonderful preservation.<br/>
