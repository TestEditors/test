stones in places where a single false step would have<br/>
involved a fall into the depth below. The animal world<br/>
was not largely represented on these desolate hills.<br/>
Vultures, eagles, and here and there a solitary <span style="color: #0000FF;">stork </span>passed<br/>
overhead; with this exception all was still.<br/>
<br/>
We saw a Bedouin camp on the top of a distant hill.<br/>
It is a great mistake to think of tents as high, pointed,<br/>
airy erections of dazzling white cloth; on the contrary, they<br/>
are dark, low huts made of skins. A blue column of smoke<br/>
rose from the camp, and men and "<span style="color: #ff0000;">aocks </span>were moving<br/>
about round the temporary settlement. Only very poor<br/>
tribes inhabit this region, between the cultivated land of<br/>
Palestine, Bethlehem, and the Valley of the Jordan. They<br/>
move about along the border hills, let their herds, horses,<br/>
and goats pasture on the grassy slopes, and shift <span style="color: #ff0000;">their</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">camp<br/>
</span>as necessity arises. They often come near the towns<br/>
where they trade with their cattle, but they do not stop<br/>
long; they acknowledge, so far as it does not incommode<br/>
them, the authority of the Sultan, and pay such taxes as.<br/>
suit them-generally none at all. These small tribes often<br/>
wage war amongst themselves, chiefly arising from thefts<br/>
of cattle or perchance of a mare.<br/>
<br/>
The true life of the Bedouins of the great, powerful,<br/>
and rich tribes begins at the Jordan. On the eastern shore<br/>
of the river the wild hosts live absolutely unsubdued; they<br/>
neither acknowledge the Sultan nor his caliphate, and<br/>
whenever the slackness of the Turkish military force<br/>
permits they swim across the sacred river and disturb the<br/>
Holy Land.<br/>
<br/>
The narrow valley came to an end after a long ride,<br/>
