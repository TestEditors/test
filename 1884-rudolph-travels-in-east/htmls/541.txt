<span>AN EARLY START. <span style="color: #0000FF;">361<br/>

<br/>
</span>a detour, shooting some smaller game as we went, and<br/>
returned in the evening to the camp. The other<br/>
gentlemen had had better luck, and brought in two<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">frankolins </span>the colour of guinea fowl, with a red band round<br/>
the neck. We had therefore now touched the habitat of<br/>
this new species, and should in the next few days make<br/>
its better acquaintance.<br/>
<br/>
We here took a very hearty leave of Salim and his<br/>
comrades. Those fine fellows were returning to their<br/>
own home. After dinner I was interested by the<br/>
picturesque look of our encampment. The fires shed<br/>
beautiful lights on the cliffs and the various figures of<br/>
the servants and Bedouins as they moved to and fro, A<br/>
great undertaking was before us for the next day in the<br/>
matter of marching, for we purposed to take two stations<br/>
at one stretch.<br/>
<br/>
Before sunrise, and indeed while it was still quite<br/>
dark, the whole camp was astir. The tents were <span style="color: #0000FF;">struck</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>and packed, and the great caravan set out on its way. We<br/>
soon followed, riding round the cone of rocks and getting<br/>
out on to the steppe. The valley narrows at this point.<br/>
The western hills advance into the plain, and steep slopes,<br/>
deep ravines and stony places have to be traversed<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>We enjoyed some beautiful views across the Valley of<br/>
the Jordan, which is here intersected by mountain streams<br/>
and gorges, and the splendid hills of the further side, with<br/>
their lofty grey cliffs and picturesque outlines. An old<br/>
tower stands on one of these mountains<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>I could not<br/>
learn what its date was, or who had erected this fortress<br/>
in a region inhabited only by wild tribes.<br/>
