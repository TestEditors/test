<span>256 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>

according to which the level of the Red Sea was 9908<br/>
metres higher than that of the Mediterranean. The<br/>
possibility of direct communication appeared thereby to be<br/>
an insoluble question, until at length, in the fourth decade<br/>
of this century, accurate measurement showed the huge<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">blunder </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">in </span>Lep? ere's reckoning. After Lesseps had obtained<br/>
the concession from the Viceroy Said Pasha for the cutting of<br/>
the isthmus, the difficult work was begun in April, 1858,<br/>
and on the 16th of November, 1869, the opening of the<br/>
maritime canal was celebrated with lavish splendour. The<br/>
cost of its execution amounted to nineteen millions sterling.<br/>
<br/>
"A necessary preliminary to the works of the canal was<br/>
the creation of a sweet-water canal for the supply of the<br/>
labourers at the canal, and hereafter of the Port of Suez, with<br/>
potable water. In the vicinity of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kasr-en-N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">il </span>a canal was<br/>
carried in a straight line from the Nile to Heliopolis, and<br/>
thence in a north-easterly direction. Wadi <span style="color: #ff0000;">TOmilat </span>was<br/>
cut through, and finally the western side of the Crocodile and<br/>
Bitter Lakes was selected as the line of the canal to Suez."<br/>
<br/>
We may here close the interesting notes which my<br/>
friend sent to me, and return to the canal and our French<br/>
steamer. We soon reached the Bitter Lakes, which have<br/>
a certain undeniable charm in the matter of scenery; the<br/>
contrast between the dark-blue waters and the dazzling<br/>
white of the desert cannot fail to arrest the traveller's<br/>
attention. In the narrow reach of the canal between the<br/>
Bitter and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Timshh </span>Lakes we observed a jackal close to the<br/>
bank, looking for shell-fish. Some fruitless shots were sent<br/>
at him. By the deep-blue waters of Lake <span style="color: #ff0000;">Timsith </span>we<br/>
again enjoyed the splendours of an African sunset.<br/>
