<span>THE PASSAGE OF THE BIRDS. 83<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
long billy hang down so funnily, and the big plump body"<br/>
appears barely to be sustained in the air by the immense<br/>
wings. Nevertheless they count as birds of long.and good<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">flight</span>. The Grand Duke and I went to the flat coast near<br/>
the tents, and hid ourselves as well as we could in the<br/>
willow bushes.<br/>
<br/>
All kinds of game went past us, and some was shot.<br/>
The campaign was a good one. We had to wait but a<br/>
short time between each shot. Grey <span style="color: #0000FF;">fish-gulls</span>, those big<br/>
but also deteriorated specimens of our ice birds, were among<br/>
our spoil; but alas! no pelican. Where we sat none came<br/>
within fire<span style="color: #ff0000;">...<br/>
<br/>
</span>We heard shots on all sides, and hoped for abundant<br/>
success. The first day the birds were <span style="color: #0000FF;">confiding </span>toward the<br/>
strangers, but by the third we had driven away all <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>game<br/>
frequenting the island, and birds of passage avoided the<br/>
perilous <span style="color: #0000FF;">rock.by </span>wide circuits.<br/>
<br/>
In an hour our morning campaign was over, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">we<br/>
</span>went back to our camp. Hard by it, however, I shot,<br/>
within a few minutes, two river eagles which were flying<br/>
over my head.<br/>
<br/>
The gentlemen came in one after another, each one with<br/>
some spoil. Pausinger had the best. He had hidden<br/>
behind an insignificant shrub close to the camp. After<br/>
brief waiting a pelican came by, flying low, and a lucky shot<br/>
from our accomplished artist brought it down.<br/>
<br/>
Before I record the further events of the day, I must<br/>
give a description of the island itself. A part of the eastern<br/>
as well as the <span style="color: #ff0000;">soyth-eastern </span>coast is flat, and covered with<br/>
shrubs; all other parts of the coast fall steeply down in<br/>
<br/>
