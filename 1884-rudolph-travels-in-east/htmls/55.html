hours on the deck, enjoying the sparkle of the sea beneath<br/>
the radiant moonlight of the south.<br/>
<br/>
The following day, as calm and fine as its predecessor,<br/>
was spent by us on the open sea. In the early morning<br/>
Candia was still in sight. The wonderful Mount Ida and<br/>
the other high mountains of this island were shrouded in<br/>
deep snow. By noon the vicinity of Africa made itself<br/>
very perceptible, and we enjoyed for the first time the all..<br/>
pervading heat. How delightful it was to lie on the deck,<br/>
basking in the southern sun, and to think of the cold we<br/>
had been enduring but a few days before in the centre of<br/>
ice-bound Europe. We passed one of Lloyd's steamers;<br/>
but, except this, all was still on the broad expanse of water.<br/>
<br/>
We awoke on the 18th February to splendid weather.<br/>
"Land in sight yet?" was the first question. Nothing<br/>
but water so far as the eye could reach. At eight <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">.<br/>
</span>the coast of Africa rose slowly into view, and some minarets<br/>
of Alexandria appeared on the horizon. They were.<br/>
greeted with exultation by the whole travelling party.<br/>
<br/>
For the second time it was given me to see the Dark<br/>
Continent. The first time I had admired the rocky shores<br/>
of the Atlas region; now I was rejoicing at the sight of<br/>
the low-lying strand of sacred Egypt.<br/>
