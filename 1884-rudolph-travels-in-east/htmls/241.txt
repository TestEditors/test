<span>APPROACH TO ASSUAN. I43<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
midst the battlements of the small town of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assuan</span>,<br/>
compressed between the river and the desert.<br/>
<br/>
Here the river divides into two branches, and the island<br/>
of Elephantine, known for its tropical vegetation, smiles on<br/>
our approach<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>A treacherous circle of black granite reefs<br/>
surrounds the charming island, and sharp angles of rock<br/>
rise out of the waters, the first sign of the coming cataracts.<br/>
<br/>
Wildly cleft rocks, desert and desolation, grand in<br/>
feature and splendid in colour; between are the rushing<br/>
river, the magnificent rock formation, and the purely<br/>
Moslem town; Islam and the mixed races of inner Africa<br/>
side by side; old Egyptian monuments, .and the beautiful<br/>
island with its tropical forms-all are before us at this<br/>
moment. We gaze with admiration on the dazzling scene;<br/>
the southernmost point of our voyage, the vicinity of the<br/>
tropic of Cancer, the verge of the tropics.<br/>
<br/>
The ship made way but slowly amidst the difficulties of<br/>
the channel, and in a few minutes lay to under a steep,<br/>
dusty bank. A mail steamer and several <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiy√© </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">werealready </span>there. As soon as we arrived we left our vessel<br/>
to visit the town thoroughly. It is certainly one of<br/>
the most interesting spots of the whole Nile journey.<br/>
It is Arab, often indeed almost Semitic in its buildings<br/>
and inhabitants, one of the furthest stations of the<br/>
trading and gain-loving Arab. It is Mohammedan as to<br/>
the religion of the state and the town, though as to that<br/>
of the country I feel a doubt.<br/>
<br/>
The houses, built of clay, have completely the character<br/>
of the old Nile towns. The streets are narrow and<br/>
foul. Only those which lie nearest the river show some<br/>
<br/>
