<br/>
</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">IVE</span>: reached Siut very early in the morning while it<br/>
was still quite dark. Unpleasantly roused from sweet<br/>
slumbers, we left the carriages, and went on foot, preceded<br/>
by torch-bearers, down a road very well lighted and<br/>
tastefully decorated, to the landing-stage of the Nile<br/>
steamers. Our consular agent, a rich Coptic merchant, had<br/>
made all these preparations and received us most cordially.<br/>
<br/>
The steamer <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ferns</span>, kindly lent to us by the Khedive,<span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>lay close to the shore, and an old Egyptian admiral who<br/>
commanded her awaited the travelling party on the bridge.<br/>
<br/>
We all grew extremely fond of our active and able<br/>
commander, a pure dark-brown African. Unfortunately, he<br/>
only spoke a few words of English, in addition to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Eastern<br/>
</span>languages, and so our conversations were often very <span style="color: #ff0000;">cbmic</span>,<br/>
between the aid of the interpreters and our own well-devised<br/>
signs.<br/>
<br/>
Brugsch Pasha, the renowned Egyptologist, accompanied<br/>
us likewise on our voyage up the Nile, and stood, together<br/>
with Herr <span style="color: #0000FF;">Rith </span>(the consular assistant and Eastern scholar<br/>
to whom we were so much indebted in all our wanderings<br/>
