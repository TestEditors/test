natural beauty passing before the eye, and inducing him to<br/>
halt. On the contrary, a sense of dread fills the soul at the<br/>
sight of the barren desert, full of sand-heaps, from the<br/>
midst of which red mountain masses rise, whose rent,<br/>
jagged, and cleft lines are sharply defined against the blue<br/>
ether. Only the brilliant light, and the transparent and<br/>
marvellously tender hues which the Eastern sun pours on<br/>
the landscape, lend even to the desert that poetic charm<br/>
which attunes the <span style="color: #0000FF;">soul.to </span>repose, and steeps it in half-conscious brooding thought. But the sea of light and colour<br/>
whose waves strike the desert soil entrances the eye and<br/>
the mind, and amply compensates for the want of the bright<br/>
children of spring, who resign to the world of light unlimited<br/>
sway over the ground, and have modestly retreated to the<br/>
black soil on the banks of the Nile.<br/>

"Egypt has been formerly rightly described by writers<br/>
of antiquity as a gift from its mighty river. The geological<br/>
investigations of modern science have only confirmed this<br/>
view. After the Nile in its northward course has penetrated through granite and sandstone, and. formed the<br/>
waterfalls of the cataracts in the most obstructed part, it<br/>
enters the region of pebble formation, and makes its<br/>
way to the sea by those long reaches which now form the<br/>
Nile Valley proper. North of Cairo the sea was a wide<br/>
bay, whose left or western side touched the Libyan, and the<br/>
right the Arabian desert. Geological investigations based<br/>
on the prehistoric remains of animal and vegetable life<br/>
found in the soil of the desert during the making of the<br/>
Canal of Suez, have furnished indefeasible proofs that the<br/>
Isthmus of Suez was once the meeting point of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">two<br/>
