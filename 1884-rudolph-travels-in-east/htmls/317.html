is that of a certain distinguished Egyptian named Thi.<br/>
He lived in the middle of the fourth century <span style="color: #ff0000;">B.C.</span>, and<br/>
prepared a chapel for himself in the vicinity of the Pyramids<br/>
of those kings under whose sway he had held his post of<br/>
officer of state..<br/>

"The richly coloured, delicate, and carefully executed<br/>
pictures on the walls of this mortuary have a high value<br/>
from the multitude of the scenes from life which they place<br/>
before our eyes in the most vivid way-the agriculture and<br/>
industries, as well as the sacrificial rites, of these <span style="color: #ff0000;">remotest<br/>
</span>periods of human history.<br/>
<br/>
"These pictures owe their existence to the belief that<br/>
in the world beyond, the earthly goods of a wealthy and<br/>
distinguished landowner would still belong to the departed.<br/>
Navigation, cattle-breeding, agriculture, the overflow of<br/>
the Nile, the handicrafts from the cobbler to the joiner,<br/>
painting and sculpture, and, to crown all, administration<br/>
down to the <span style="color: #ff0000;">humblest </span>clerk; nothing is forgotten to give to<br/>
the pictures the impress of the most life-like exactitude..<br/>
The wife and children take a prominent place in these<br/>
scenes. The first is especially favoured with the most<br/>
flattering qualities, which culminate in the expression,' Her<br/>
beauty was proverbial, and sweet was her gentleness to her<br/>
husband."<br/>
<br/>
In the cities of the dead of Memphis, which extend<br/>
in unbroken succession from Abu-roash to Fayum, the<br/>
old graves of the Memphite kings rose visible from'afar<br/>
at the edge of the desert plateau. These kings ruled in<br/>
Egypt from B.C. 4000 to B.C. 2500. Although a large<br/>
number of these tombs have ere now been levelled to<br/>
