could be covered.<br/>
<br/>
The sun scorched fiercely, no breath of air stirred,<br/>
and the blue sky lay cloudless in the mid-day haze.<br/>
Climbing the first hill was melting work; the steep sides<br/>
overgrown with short grass were slippery, and not a stone<br/>
gave foothold. Some partridges rose up in the distance,<br/>
a big jackal was missed by Chorinsky, and the Grand Duke<br/>
killed a remarkably large serpent which it required a good<br/>
shot to capture.<br/>
<br/>
Two grassy green hills were happily surmounted, but<br/>
the heaters followed languidly. Gaps occurred, and the<br/>
form of a correct drive according to European notions<br/>
got more and more lost. The country now assumed<br/>
another character. Flat stone cliffs, caves and grottoes,<br/>
old walls and terraces between, built up for olives and<br/>
vines, and rocky valleys like those behind the village of<br/>
<span style="color: #ff0000;">Betsahur</span>, took the place of bare hills. We had hardly got<br/>
on this ground when a <span style="color: #0000FF;">jackal </span>leaped out just below me'<br/>
from beside a big rock. A shot sent after him brought<br/>
him down, but the agile beast, though mortally hit,<br/>
disappeared at once into a deep burrow.<br/>
<br/>
As I wished to secure my booty, I <span style="color: #ff0000;">despatched </span>my<br/>
huntsman to the camp to fetch the dachshunds, and<br/>
waited by the spot, where the faithful and ever-ready<br/>
Achmed. refreshed me with lemonade. The other gentlemen continued the drive to the camp. Count Waldburg<br/>
shot another partridge which rose close to him.<br/>
<br/>
My huntsman soon returned with three dachshunds.<br/>
Scheck, the biggest and strongest, a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sclavonian </span>by birth,<br/>
