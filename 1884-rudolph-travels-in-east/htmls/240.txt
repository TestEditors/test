pursued our voyage towards Assuan. The beautiful<br/>
scenery kept us on deck. Low but well-shaped hills<br/>
approached close to the shore on either side, in many<br/>

bank gave place to a lonely, desolate plain, scattered<br/>
over with blocks of stone, out of which here and there<br/>
jagged cones projected.. On the left bank a tolerably high<br/>
hill dips its foot in the waves of the Nile. Its summit is<br/>
crowned by an old building, doubtless of Moslem origin.<br/>
Soon palms appear, then green gardens, and from their<br/>
