seas. The waves of the Mediterranean flowing from the<br/>
north washed the mouth of a self-made natural canal, while<br/>
from the south the waters of the Red Sea broke through<br/>
the low-lying portions of the Arabian desert, and united<br/>
with the advancing current from the northern sea. The<br/>
united waters divided Asia from Africa for a space of<br/>
nearly seventy miles.<br/>
<br/>
"In the course of time the surging of both seas necessarily brought about the deposit of the sand they bore<br/>
along with them, and a bar was gradually formed which<br/>
grew into a dune and then into a mighty dyke. This it is<br/>
which, lying in the middle of the isthmus, or somewhat<br/>
north of it, now rises to a height of sixteen metres, and is<br/>
known as <span style="color: #0000FF;">El-Gisr</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">i.e</span>. the dyke, t the threshold.'<br/>
<br/>
"This threshold, the highest point in the track we are<br/>
describing, was thus the only bridge by which the isthmus<br/>
could be crossed by land. We must assume that the<br/>
formation of the Delta went on at the same time. The<br/>
mud deposited at the periodically recurring floods of the<br/>
Nile resulted in the first instance in the formation of the<br/>
cultivated land of Upper Egypt. In like manner deposits<br/>
were formed in the broad basin between the Libyan and<br/>
Arabian deserts, and extended to the present northern<br/>
boundary, and thus in the strictest sense of the words the<br/>
Delta came into existence as a gift from the Nile, whose<br/>
beneficent waters pass through it in three principal and five<br/>
minor branches on their way to the Mediterranean. The<br/>
opposing current of the Mediterranean, deflected and<br/>
beaten back from the Syrian coast, has prevented the<br/>
formation of land on the eastern coast of the Delta. The<br/>
