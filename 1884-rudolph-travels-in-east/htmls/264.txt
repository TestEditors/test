<span>156 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

the river divides into branches, we put in, and walked along<br/>
the rocky bank to a point which afforded a view over the<br/>
wild rocks and tossing waters. The cataracts are not<br/>
waterfalls, but rapids. Thousands of rocky islets, cliffs, and<br/>
reefs fill the bed of the river for more than a kilometer.<br/>
Through these the river, foaming and roaring, makes its<br/>
way. It is, without question, a grand scene, and its peculiar<br/>
charm is enhanced by the striking black colour, and the<br/>
shape of the reefs and shoals of rocks which rise through<br/>
the white froth of the flood. It is interesting, too, to see<br/>
the ordinarily sluggish, turbid Nile converted for a brief<br/>
space into a raging mountain stream.<br/>
<br/>
The moment we had reached the best point of view, a<br/>
number of naked Nubians appeared, jumped into the<br/>
waves, and, avoiding the rocks, allowed themselves to<br/>
be swept along through the most furious and rapid<br/>
of the arms of the river. In a few seconds they were<br/>
carried, swift as arrows sped from a bow, a long way down,<br/>
and then scrambled out of the water to come to us<br/>
dripping and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Glamorous </span>for backsheesh. Returning to the<br/>
boat, we were rowed a short way up stream, and then,<br/>
mounting the asses which awaited us, rode back to Assuan<br/>
by the same way by which we had come in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
The excursion had taken the whole day, and it was late<br/>
in the afternoon when we reached our steamer. We dined<br/>
at once, and after dinner Hoyos and I went again, as<br/>
twilight came on, to the hiding-places which we had<br/>
occupied the day before. My huntsman urged us to do<br/>
this, because, while we were in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Philae</span>, he had found fresh<br/>
tracks of hyaenas by the remains of the carrion.<br/>
