<span>3o TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
of men saying prayers came slowly after. The whole was<br/>
an extraordinary picture.<br/>
<br/>
We made a circuit and returned into the town through<br/>
the gate "Porte de <span style="color: #ff0000;">Moharrem </span>Bey" of the ancient and<br/>
now useless fortifications.<br/>
<br/>
In the evening hours there is far more stir in the<br/>
streets than by day, and the noise, shouts, and ceaseless cries<br/>
contrast with the stillness which night has shed over nature.<br/>
The shops were all still lighted and the caf√©s open. The<br/>
names in the European quarter are put up either in Greek,<br/>
French, or Italian.<br/>
<br/>
N ight had set in ere we reached the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>. The<br/>
German Consul-General, Baron Saurma, came to dinner.<br/>
From this time forward this gentleman was much with our<br/>
travelling party, and to him, especially in matters of the<br/>
chase, we were under many obligations.<br/>
<br/>
Early on the 19th we left the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Miramar</span>, bidding her<br/>
farewell for a long time. An Egyptian gala-barge of<br/>
the Viceroy's brought us to land. This very singular vessel<br/>
was fitted up in Oriental fashion. Everything was red;<br/>
the clothing of the sailors no less than the covers of the<br/>
cushioned seats, the richly draped sides, and the baldacchino<br/>
over <span style="color: #0000FF;">as</span>. Eastern sailors row quite differently to European<br/>
ones, but it is undeniable that the perfect time of the<br/>
stroke, accompanied as it is by a strange humming song,<br/>
has a pleasant effect.<br/>
<br/>
We drove from the harbour to the station, where a<br/>
great crowd had gathered, almost entirely Austrians or<br/>
members of our colony. A band played "God save the.<br/>
Emperor," and the Dalmatians in their rich costume <span style="color: #0000FF;">waved<br/>
<br/>
