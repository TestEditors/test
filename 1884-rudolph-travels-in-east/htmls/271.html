which splendid mountains rise. Soon after our arrival we<br/>
resolved to employ the <span style="color: #ff0000;">favouring </span>moonlight in hunting<br/>
beasts of prey, and went off in various directions to choose<br/>
suitable points for our evening stations.<br/>
<br/>
Pausinger and I, accompanied by a fellaheen, walked<br/>
across the tilled land, past a wretched village, out into the<br/>
desert. We saw in dim and misty outline the ruins of<br/>
the ancient Egyptian town <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nechebt </span>(called Eileithyia by<br/>
the Greeks). The strongly built outer wall of unburnt<br/>
brick overtops everything else, and shows that this place<br/>
was a considerable fortress in antiquity. There are also<br/>
here, on a ledge of the mountain, some rock tombs, a rock<br/>
temple founded by Ptolemy Euergetes, and further on a<br/>
small sanctuary of Amenhotep III., dedicated to the<br/>
goddess <span style="color: #ff0000;">Nechebt</span>.<br/>
<br/>
The desert is much impregnated with soda in this part,<br/>
and at every step the broken crust crackles. We went<br/>
nearly to the foot of the mountains, hid ourselves there.<br/>
between two big rocks, binding a bleating kid a few paces<br/>
in front to a stake which we had brought with us. A<br/>
quarter of an hour had hardly elapsed when a Bedouin<br/>
appeared, wrapped in a white cloak, riding on a camel<br/>
and singing plaintive songs. The strange rider on his tall<br/>
steed was a striking object in the monotonous desert. The<br/>
wailing kid appeared to excite the Bedouin's attention.<br/>
He stopped, considered the surroundings, began a conversation with himself half aloud, and then rode on his<br/>
way without discovering us.<br/>
<br/>
When all was again quiet, I heard the rustling of an<br/>
animal creeping up. The kid moaned and jumped about<br/>
