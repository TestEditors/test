<span>78 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
During all this wild and somewhat irregular sport, <span style="color: #ff0000;">I</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/>
</span>had not got a single shot. After half an hour's waiting,<br/>
when most of the gentlemen had already left their places in<br/>
order to get nearer to the barking dogs, I discovered a<br/>
cross road which led through the plantation.<br/>
<br/>
I hastened along it to a spot where an irrigation channel<br/>
which ran into the interior of the cane-stock afforded a<br/>
narrow passage, not a yard wide, down which I could fire.<br/>
I planted <span style="color: #0000FF;">myself </span>there to await the advancing game. The<br/>
dogs approached but slowly, for the wounded wolf frequently turned to bay upon them. When at length the<br/>
great wolf passed within range, the dogs which surrounded<br/>
him prevented my firing<span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>Further on the fight recommenced, and I heard the snarl of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">wolf.mingle </span>with<br/>
the clear bark of. the dachshunds. In a few moments the<br/>
pursuit-stopped, and all was still. The dachshunds hunt<br/>
the wolf unwillingly, and one cannot therefore depend either<br/>
on their persistent pursuit of one that has been wounded,<br/>
or on their giving tongue when one has died. The wolf<br/>
which <span style="color: #0000FF;">does </span>not drop on the spot is for the most part lost.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes more, and the bark of other dachshunds<br/>
in the opposite corner of the field told of the commencement of a new hunt. Again the hunt came across the<br/>
sugar-canes in my direction; again it came on, but very<br/>
slowly, and one could tell that the dogs had to deal with a<br/>
wounded wolf. When they came within a hundred paces<br/>
of me, I perceived that the eager dogs were at bay. Whilst<br/>
listening attentively to this contest, I heard suddenly, close<br/>
beside <span style="color: #0000FF;">he</span>, a gentle rustling, and immediately an unwounded<br/>
<br/>
wolf crept along the narrow glade<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
</span></span>
