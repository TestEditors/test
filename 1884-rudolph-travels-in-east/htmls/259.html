<span>TEMPLE <span style="color: #0000FF;">OF </span>ISIS. 153<br/>

<br/>
which here abound on the opposite side of the stream.<br/>
Above us the blue vault of the southern sky lifts its<br/>
dome, whose resplendence illumines the whole scene.<br/>
All is light in this lonely half-vanished world of the days<br/>
that are gone.<br/>
<br/>
The patroness of Nubia, the goddess Isis, had the<br/>
reputation of special sanctity in this place. Egyptians<br/>
and <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">ubians </span>sacrificed at her altars and venerated her<br/>
with equal devotion. The brightly painted walls and<br/>
pillars of her temple give even now the idea of cheerful<br/>
worship which found an outward expression in light and<br/>
colour.<br/>
<br/>
When the temples of Isis were deserted and forgotten<br/>
the nascent faith of Christendom built here one of its<br/>
oldest churches, to which the Nubian <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barabras </span>made pilgrimages with pious ardour. Now they have abandoned<br/>
the Christian faith of their fathers, <span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span>the memory of<br/>
their former creed only lives in their language in the.<br/>
word <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kiraye </span>(Greek, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Kuriake</span>) for "Sunday."<br/>
<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Barabras </span>have become Moslems in the full sense<br/>
of the term, but their old home, with its central point<br/>
Philae, has remained the same.<br/>
<br/>
After we had visited all parts of the temple we went<br/>
across the remains of many old walls, and through rubbish<br/>
and ruin, to the extreme southern point of the island.<br/>
<br/>
A grey rock slopes in steps towards the river <span style="color: #0000FF;">from<br/>
<br/>
</span>beneath an old -Egyptian platform. Thick luxuriant<br/>
shrubs and tall grass grow over the dark stone.<br/>
<br/>
With sorrowful heart I clambered to the utmost verge<br/>
of the steep brink, and looked out over the holy Nile, the<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
