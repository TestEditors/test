<br/>
</span>themselves wear, articles of dress for Nubian <span style="color: #0000FF;">ladies-i.e</span>. a<br/>
string from which small cords hang, dipped, because of<br/>
the flies, in fearful smelling unguents-straw hats for the<br/>
wild tribes, and trifles of all kinds.<br/>
<br/>
Over the doors of many houses I saw stuffed young<br/>
crocodiles nailed up; and tame apes sat at the doors. I<br/>
bought myself one which afforded us much amusement, but<br/>
unfortunately it died at Cairo.<br/>
<br/>
The life and stir of the bazaar was very interesting.<br/>
The <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ababdehs </span>especially interested me by their warlike<br/>
appearance, armed to the teeth, scantily clad in a few rags,<br/>
and with a peculiar arrangement of the hair.<br/>
<br/>
The various savages looked at us with curiosity, and<br/>
the sly Arabs with crafty cunning sold us African wares at<br/>
high prices, adroitly profiting by our evident interest in<br/>
them.<br/>
<br/>
On an open space between the houses and the <span style="color: #ff0000;">landingplace </span>the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ababdehs </span>performed their war-dance for us. It is<br/>
nothing more than the wild jumping to and fro of savages'<br/>
in the very lowest stage of development. The accompanying music, consisting of horrible droning pewter tamtams,<br/>
reminded me of the jingle which resounds at the dances of<br/>
negro slaves in Morocco, but the dance itself resembled the<br/>
unbridled amusements of the reef pirates of the north<br/>
coast of N orth-West Africa.<br/>
<br/>
The worthy <span style="color: #ff0000;">Ababdehs </span>jumped about to the utmost of<br/>
their bodily powers, and executed leaps of incredible length,<br/>
howling and screaming at the same time. They swung<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">and </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">hurled </span>swords and spears aloft, rapped with them on<br/>
their <span style="color: #0000FF;">leathern </span>shields, and feigned attacks upon one another.<br/>
