<span>I36 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
The day was ill-suited to this kind of sport, for thick<br/>
clouds of sand filled the air, hiding even the nearer<br/>
mountains from view. The <span style="color: #ff0000;">champsin </span>had returned in<br/>
the morning with renewed violence. I soon quitted my<br/>
old Egyptian ambush, and went to a small reservoir of<br/>
water, bordered with slabs of stone, which lies within the<br/>
ruins and is of ancient date. Several snipe and sand-pipers,<br/>
probably overcome by fatigue on the journey, sat pitifully<br/>
on the bare stones. A brief crusade put an end to their<br/>
troubled existence.<br/>
<br/>
I now rode by the nearest path back to Luxor and the<br/>
steamer. We had planned for the afternoon a first visit<br/>
to the monuments on the western <span style="color: #0000FF;">shore</span>, but were obliged<br/>
to change our plans because of the steadily growing storm<br/>
which raged, and we resolved to pursue our further journey<br/>
next day, and to reserve the west side of Thebes until<br/>
our return from the cataracts.<br/>
<br/>
The afternoon was spent partly on board and partly in<br/>
Luxor itself. I went with Brugsch Pasha to visit the<br/>
German consular agent, a Copt, and a dealer in.Egyptian<br/>
antiquities. We found he had better things than his<br/>
English colleague of the preceding day. We bought several<br/>
valuable articles and put them on board the steamer, where<br/>
an Egyptian museum was growing apace.<br/>
<br/>
On the 5th we proceeded on our voyage at sunrise.<br/>
By the advice of some Europeans in Luxor we resolved to<br/>
stop at the neighbouring village of Erment, known for its<br/>
sugar factory and its extensive sugar-cane plantations, and<br/>
to devote some hours to hunting there.<br/>
<br/>
After a two hours' voyage <span style="color: #0000FF;">welad </span>reached our point.<br/>
