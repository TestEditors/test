<span>STRUGGLE WITH AN <span style="color: #0000FF;">ICHNEUMON</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>97<br/>

<br/>
wood by the shore in a northerly direction. Marching<br/>
through the burning sand of the desert, which reflected the<br/>
most intense heat, was anything but agreeable. Once more<br/>
we surrounded the shrubs at fixed intervals, and soon a<br/>
merry hunt began. This time, however, the baited game<br/>
did not show itself so readily, and the chase went <span style="color: #0000FF;">backwards </span>and forwards several times. After standing at bay<br/>
for a short time, an ichneumon appeared in front of the<br/>
Grand Duke, who rolled the absurd creature over, it is<br/>
true, but it dragged itself back into the bush, where a<br/>
violent battle at once began with the dogs, who" were on<br/>
its track. One large long-legged dachshund and the<br/>
ichneumon had got such tight hold of each other, that one<br/>
might have lifted them together. It was with the greatest<br/>
difficulty that the combatants were separated, and in doing<br/>
so one gentleman was bitten in the hand by the dog, and<br/>
another by the ichneumon.<br/>
<br/>
Numerous cormorants and herons had passed by <span style="color: #ff0000;">me</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"<br/>
</span>along the shore while they were beating, but I had not fired<br/>
on account of the larger.prey. As it was afternoon, we resolved to set out on our long row back to the opposite side,<br/>
and to take the most direct line. We rowed across in<br/>
several boats. The air had become cooler, and we could<br/>
enjoy the distant view over the lake and desert more<br/>
than we had done earlier in the day.<br/>
<br/>
Our boat people were in high spirits, and amidst <span style="color: #0000FF;">incessant </span>yells and inarticulate wild howls they pulled all<br/>
their clothes off, and, stark naked, raced the boats one<br/>
against the other. This game had a practical advantage<br/>
for us, for we got on all the quicker.<br/>
