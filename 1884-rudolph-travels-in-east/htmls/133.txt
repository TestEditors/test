<span>OUR BEDOUIN HUNTSMEN. 75<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Each gentleman got a horse, and our servants also;<br/>
we had, moreover, to engage bearers to carry our<br/>
dachshunds, so indispensable in this country. A regular<br/>
pack they made. Baron Saurma had ten, and we four,<br/>
brave powerful animals. With some difficulty the crowd<br/>
of curious staring people which had gathered round was<br/>
got rid of, and prevented from following us.<br/>
<br/>
Our hunting Bedouins, whom we had in fact compelled<br/>
to accompany us, rode and ran in front. They are a small<br/>
isolated tribe, robed in white, or, to speak more truly, dirty<br/>
yellow, burnous, with long guns and bent knives, the<br/>
primitive tobacco-pouch, together with a bag of powder and<br/>
chopped lead, tied at the waist, their long legs bare, and red<br/>
slippers on their feet. They were here, as everywhere in<br/>
North Africa, but poor beggars. <span style="color: #ff0000;">N </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">o </span>colours, and no good<br/>
clothes, not even a turban on the head; only the brown,<br/>
close-fitting fellaheen cap; the younger ones were even<br/>
bare-headed.<br/>
<br/>
The type of these people was interesting. They were<br/>
genuine Berbers from the Libyan desert, dark brown and<br/>
much more strongly coloured than those of Lower Egypt;<br/>
for the most part tall and slender in figure, but with features<br/>
less noble and beautiful than those of the northern<br/>
Bedouin tribes. Southern and even negro blood is quite<br/>
apparent; some quite black fellows with short curly hair<br/>
might have passed for Moors. They have been stolen as<br/>
slaves when children in the interior of Africa, and have<br/>
obtained their freedom from the tribe. They assume the<br/>
language, clothes, and manners of the Bedouins, and quite<br/>
forget their extraction and even the land from which they<br/>
