<span>220 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
dark we had reached our goal. A few hundred yards<br/>
separated us from the shore, but the water was too shallow,<br/>
and so not only the whole of our baggage, but we ourselves, had to be carried across by our brave Arabs to the<br/>
bank of the canal.<br/>
<br/>
We had sent the swiftest of the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiy√© </span>forward with<br/>
a letter; so a small steamer was already waiting for us at<br/>
the canal, and our consul and the port captain, a Dalmatian<br/>
by birth, were on the shore. We saw the Canal of Suez<br/>
for the first time, and Asia lying on its further side.<br/>
The first sight of this quarter of the world was not very<br/>
beautiful. Asia presented herself in the form of a dyke.<br/>
<br/>
The steamer brought us quickly to a quay not far from<br/>
the hotel, There were none but Europeans in the streets,<br/>
and everything that we saw would have been just as<br/>
characteristic of an English seaport. The hotel was a<br/>
large and perfectly modern one, very well kept, and put<br/>
me in mind of Switzerland. Not the shadow of a reminder<br/>
of the East. With the exception of an English family, we<br/>
were the only guests this evening. Soon after our arrival<br/>
an excellent supper was served, and by ten o'clock we<br/>
were all safe in our beds.<br/>
<br/>
We left the hotel next morning, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">betook </span>ourselves to<br/>
a Suez Canal steamer. The commander, a testy old man,<br/>
and the whole crew were French. As a general rule the<br/>
Canal of Suez and all that belongs to it is a portion of<br/>
France herself.<br/>
<br/>
At first we could see over the banks of the canal,<br/>
obtaining to the west a view of Lake Menzaleh, and to the<br/>
east that of the Asiatic plain of Pelusium.<br/>
