<span>PREFACE.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
LEGENDARY lore and the pious faith of men have<br/>
alike placed the cradle of humanity in the distant East.<br/>
The migrations of the great families of mankind have<br/>
all, as a matter of fact, had their origin in the East; and<br/>
the mightiest religions, similar at least in their being and<br/>
their birth, have all sprung from the land of the rising<br/>
sun, where the glory of nature <span style="color: #0000FF;">inches </span>to thought of the<br/>
supernatural.<br/>
<br/>
The earliest history of the human race-the ruins of<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">primaeval </span>culture-the home-of philosophy, of fable, and<br/>
of myth---of our speech and of our faith-all meet us<br/>
<br/>
face to face in the resplendent sun-illumined East.<br/>
