<br/>
After a passage of many hours we reached the salt lake<br/>
of Ismailia and the town of that <span style="color: #0000FF;">name-a </span>wholly European<br/>
place. The yellowish-white deserts which surround the<br/>
lake, too, are mostly quite level. Far off to the south you<br/>
see the fine range of the Ataka mountains. The region<br/>
is undoubtedly stern and monotonous; but the dark blue<br/>
of the salt water of the lake is in striking contrast to the<br/>
light-hued desert shore, and the whole makes a remarkable<br/>
combination of colour.<br/>
<br/>
On the short drive to the station we had occasion to<br/>
admire the wealth, industry, and good taste of the French.<br/>
They have succeeded in evoking from the desert a charming little sea-bathing place, with clean white houses, with<br/>
green jalousies, good roads, shady avenues, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">well-caredfor </span>gardens. When our train started we passed some<br/>
small marshes, then traversed the desert, which is here<br/>
completely Arab. Further on lay a small lake with reeds<br/>
about it, and a few wretched cabins were in its neighbourhood. When the desert hills near the line were low<br/>
enough to admit of a distant view, we saw to the south the<br/>
lofty Ataka, and further on the mountains of Ammon.<br/>
This chain is the same whose western spur is formed by<br/>
the familiar Gebel Mokattam.<br/>
<br/>
After a time the desert seemed to retire, and at last<br/>
disappeared from sight, and we were once more in the rich<br/>
cultivated land of Lower Egypt. We passed the town of<br/>
Zagazig and several smaller places. Soon the lovely City<br/>
of the Caliphs came into view, golden in the beams of the<br/>
setting sun. We took the shortest road from the station to<br/>
Kasr-eu-Nusha, where we devoted the evening to repose<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/>
