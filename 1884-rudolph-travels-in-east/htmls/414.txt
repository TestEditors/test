to the orthodox Greek Church. People poured out of<br/>
the town to stare at us, and followed our caravan a<br/>
long time.<br/>
<br/>
After leaving the neighbourhood of Ramleh the country<br/>
began to assume another character. The road led gently<br/>
downhill into a broad valley from whose further side<br/>
the Judaean mountains rose. The fields were covered<br/>
here and there with stones, and smooth shining slabs of<br/>
stone peeped between the evergreen shrubs. In the<br/>
vicinity of a sheik's tomb a successful double shot secured<br/>
for me a pair of fine large red-legged partridges.<br/>
<br/>
Soon after sunset we got to Latrun, lying most<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">picturesquely </span>among rocks and green shrubs at the foot<br/>
of the chain of hills. Our handsome camp had been<br/>
pitched by the ruins of an old fortress (of what date it<br/>
would be hard to say). It was quite a city of Turkish<br/>
tents, made of beautiful material and fitted with every<br/>
comfort. We could not but think of the days of the<br/>
old Soliman. Numerous beasts of <span style="color: #0000FF;">burden-mostly </span>mules<br/>
or small <span style="color: #0000FF;">horses</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-and </span>the host of servants-Drums from<br/>

among the rocks.<br/>
<br/>
Mr. Howard, the <span style="color: #ff0000;">etttrefnetnteuor </span>who in his <span style="color: #0000FF;">changeful<br/>
</span>life had accepted an English name and protection, is a<br/>
pure dark Oriental who lives as a dragoman and purveyor<br/>
of caravans and excursions at Beyrout. We learnt to<br/>
appreciate his unflinching energy and excellent qualities<br/>
in hard days when heavy duties devolved upon him.<br/>
Howard had attached to the caravan two <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedouins-the<br/>
