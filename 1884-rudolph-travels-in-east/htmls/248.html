<br/>
chapels, sarcophagi, and slabs of all kinds. An unfinished<br/>
obelisk lies here still on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">spot</span>, vainly awaiting its former<br/>
destination."<br/>

Since the days of the Pharaohs these quarries have<br/>

city of the dead, and round about all the endless medley of<br/>
mountains, valleys, plains, and plateaus, desolate and bare,<br/>
stone and sand, true desert; yet all tremulous in the glaring<br/>
