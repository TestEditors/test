</span>fiercely, and in the midday heat our vessel smelt even<br/>
worse than by night. An old man, blind of one eye, somewhat deformed, with a curling white beard, and adorned<br/>
with a turban, and altogether very offensive as to his outer<br/>
man, sat close beside us. He did not row, and had only<br/>
come with us out of curiosity.<br/>
<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>were annoyed at this unwelcome guest, whose<br/>
vicinity was in fact not free from danger, as he pursued<br/>
<span style="color: #0000FF;">uninterruptedly </span>a not unsuccessful vermin hunt in his<br/>
capacious garments.<br/>
<br/>
We reached the rock safely in half an hour, where the<br/>
other gentlemen were waiting for us. They had shot a<br/>
fair number of black <span style="color: #0000FF;">coat</span>. The whole spoil of the first half<br/>

charge of my huntsman to the opposite coast, where meantime our new camp had been pitched.<br/>
<br/>
The hunting party now agreed to rest for an hour. By<br/>
the shore, on the slope of our rocky cape, we made a<br/>
frugal breakfast, consisting of cold meat, bread, sundry<br/>
more or less uneatable preserves, and stale lemonade. Our<br/>
people amused themselves with catching the queer little<br/>
grey lizards with a high comb on the <span style="color: #ff0000;">back-Aloe </span>so-called<br/>
Gekos. Scorpions lay about in numbers under the<br/>
stones.<br/>
<br/>
The rest was no refreshment, for the sun burnt horribly<br/>
against the oblique slope of rock; the ground glowed, and<br/>
the air was tremulous in the scorching heat. It was the<br/>
hottest day that we had yet had to endure on our journey,<br/>
far hotter than the warmest summer day in Europe.<br/>
<br/>
We soon set off again, and walked along the <span style="color: #0000FF;">under<br/>
