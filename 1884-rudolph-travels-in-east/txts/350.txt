220 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



dark we had reached our goal. A few hundred yards
separated us from the shore, but the water was too shallow,
and so not only the whole of our baggage, but we ourselves, had to be carried across by our brave Arabs to the
bank of the canal.

We had sent the swiftest of the dahabiy√© forward with
a letter; so a small steamer was already waiting for us at
the canal, and our consul and the port captain, a Dalmatian
by birth, were on the shore. We saw the Canal of Suez
for the first time, and Asia lying on its further side.
The first sight of this quarter of the world was not very
beautiful. Asia presented herself in the form of a dyke.

The steamer brought us quickly to a quay not far from
the hotel, There were none but Europeans in the streets,
and everything that we saw would have been just as
characteristic of an English seaport. The hotel was a
large and perfectly modern one, very well kept, and put
me in mind of Switzerland. Not the shadow of a reminder
of the East. With the exception of an English family, we
were the only guests this evening. Soon after our arrival
an excellent supper was served, and by ten o'clock we
were all safe in our beds.

We left the hotel next morning, and betook ourselves to
a Suez Canal steamer. The commander, a testy old man,
and the whole crew were French. As a general rule the
Canal of Suez and all that belongs to it is a portion of
France herself.

At first we could see over the banks of the canal,
obtaining to the west a view of Lake Menzaleh, and to the
east that of the Asiatic plain of Pelusium.
