PREFACE.



LEGENDARY lore and the pious faith of men have
alike placed the cradle of humanity in the distant East.
The migrations of the great families of mankind have
all, as a matter of fact, had their origin in the East; and
the mightiest religions, similar at least in their being and
their birth, have all sprung from the land of the rising
sun, where the glory of nature inches to thought of the
supernatural.

The earliest history of the human race-the ruins of
primaeval culture-the home-of philosophy, of fable, and
of myth---of our speech and of our faith-all meet us

face to face in the resplendent sun-illumined East.
