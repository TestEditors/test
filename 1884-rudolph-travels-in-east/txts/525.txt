A PLAGUE OF FLIES. 349



abandon it, but in the meantime we had found an interesting relic. In the funnel of a burrow a Protestant hymnbook was discovered, probably carried thither by the inmate,
after the fashion of many animals that burrow. Here, at
any rate, were the genuine evangelic psalms and hymns,
and the prayer for the Emperor William. On the whole,
the volume was in good condition, outside as well as in;
only a few stains of blood on the paper. God only knows
how this European book came into this savage spot, and
how its owner lost it; perchance his bones may be bleaching
hard by in the impenetrable thicket.

We mounted our horses and rode home. Salim
went in front at a hand gallop. He sat without saddle
or horse-cloth on the bare back of a small roan, guiding
the frisky creature with a rope fastened to it only on
one side.

Close to Jericho I noticed a "Jean le blanc" eagle
washing in the brook. I crept up to him under cover of the
overhanging bank, and in a few minutes had the splendid
specimen in my bag.

The other gentlemen had also shot a considerable
quantity of smaller game, and a regular show was set
up when we had all reached the camp. After this we
breakfasted. Unhappily the meal consisted rather in driving
away the flies than in eating. It is difficult to form an
idea of the throng of insects that attacked our food. We
passed the hottest hours in camp, seeking rest. The
terrible heat unhappily made this a prolonged torture, and
it was difficult even to collect one's thoughts so far as to jot
down the necessary notes and to write some letters home.
