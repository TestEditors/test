336 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



Behind our camp rose a high, bare, rocky hill, projecting
from the range of frontier mountains and separated from
them by a ravine. Greek hermits dwell in the caves
in the sides of this deserted valley. This settlement of
pious anchorites has existed from the beginning of the
Christian era to the present day.

As we rode up to the spring a splendid sight awaited
us. The camp of the free Bedouins was pitched on the
left of the Jordan. Wonderful horses, mostly white, fed
in the rich grass. A chestnut mare, a dainty creature,
stood beside a tree, bound to its branches. It was the
battle horse of the master, of the grey-haired Sheik Ali.
Bedouins in long white robes, with turbans on their heads,
and armed with guns, daggers, and sabres, sat beside a fire
at which they were cooking their food. Long lances, the
badge of the great lawless tribes, the largest weapons which
can be described by the name of lance, cut out of the finest
wood, were driven into the ground side by side.

Sheik Ali waited for me in front of our tents surrounded
by his sons and companions. The grey-haired nomad
king, with his noble delicate features, his pointed white
beard, his tall and still sinewy and upright figure, was
dressed in a richly ornamented robe of dazzling whiteness. He had a Turkish sabre buckled round his loins,
yellow shoes on his feet, and a broad turban on his head.
He extended his jewelled hand to me in friendly greeting.
His sons and the leading chiefs of the tribes stood round
him respectfully. Every movement bespoke unbounded
obedience, love, and reverence for their wise and longtried chief.
