ambush. The Baron and the Arabs went back down to
the quarry to watch the course of the sport. From our
elevated look-out it was just the right distance for small
shot to the lure lying at the bottom of the ravine.

The weather had become cloudy, and small rain was
falling. This is the greatest rarity in Cairo, whereuhey
say that it only rains seven times in a year, and one of
these seven fell to us for our hunt, for which we should
have desired a perfectly clear sky.

For a long time nothing came. The unceasing practising of bugles and trumpets reached us from the citadel,
while the heavy close air and the small space, which
prevented all movement, was stupefying. At last a pair of
ravens Buttered down, and thereupon some kites, impatient
for their breakfast. The loathsome carrion vulture followed with its bare skull.

The tedious and prolonged waiting determined me to
advise my uncle, who had never shot one of these vultures,
to fire. No sooner said than done, and, as the smoke
cleared off, I hastened down to the spot. I begged my
uncle to wait a while longer, as the sun was breaking
through, and I descended with this most unsavoury spoil
to the quarry below. On arriving there, Baron Saurma
and I found a favourable post of observation, and awaited,
telescope in hand, coming events.

In a quarter of an hour the first great vultures appeared-the mighty Vuimr fulzms. With slow flapping
wings they moved round the summit of the mountain.
One followed another, and soon sixty had assembled in"

the air.
