SEARCH FOR OUR PREY.. 303



was not small at finding that the great heavy donkey had
disappeared. No sign of dragging was to be seen on the
ground. The grass was not turned, and so it seemed
proved that an unusually strong beast of prey must have
simply carried the heavy ass away. As some of the small
scraps were also gone, we searched about and found a large
jackal not twenty paces off. Longer legged, bigger, and
with a shorter and more bushy tail than the Egyptian, and
a yellow coat only broken by a greyish-blue stripe on the
back, the fine creature seemed to me different from any
jackal which I had previously killed.

We soon found a track of blood which led direct from
the place to the road, and across it to a wall. Here we could
see that the ass had been dragged over the stones, as hair
and blood stuck to the sharp corners. On the other side
the carrion had again been carried. The track of blood
now took the direction of one of the deeply cut valleys
which lead towards the mountains by the Jordan.

I crept cautiously forward, and looking over a mound
I saw about fifty steps in advance a dark object, and beside
it a small orange-coloured animal. One of those wonderfully pretty dainty ferrets (desert fox), with his long bat's
ears, was making a comfortable breakfast. A good shot
laid the little fellow low.

Hastening to the spot, I found my prey lying by the head
of our ass. As a matter of course, I examined everything
with minute care. The heavy, large skull of a full-grown
ass of the large Asiatic breed had been simply bitten clean
' off; one could see the marks of the teeth. The beast of
prey had vanished with the rest of the body. To this spot
