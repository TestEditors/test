A RACE ON THE PYRAMIDS. 207



desert; dark shadows lay on the eastern mountains, and
the old citadel, as well as the Mokattam mountains, shone
in rosy tints like our Alpine glow.

Some of the Pyramid guides especially expert in
running, went, in virtue of a handsome backsheesh, in
eight minutes down from the top of the Cheops Pyramid
and up to the summit of that of Chefr√©n, the upper part
of which, having no steps, is very dangerous to climb.

After this display of activity we too climbed down
from our lofty station. On the way a young guide, with
a fine and genuinely Arab countenance, told me that he
was no Egyptian-not one of the miserable fellaheen-but
had the honour to spring from a noble stock in Algiers,
and as a man who had seen the world, knew not only
Tunis but also Morocco, where the true Arabs live, and
not the wretched mixed races of the Valley of the Nile.
The good man seemed to feel much irritation with his
present compatriots, and gave his feelings full vent as he
saw that the conversation interested me.

At the foot of the Pyramids we had to look on at
a performance by some Bedouins. They rode past
each other at full speed, discharging their guns. Neither
the men, their horses, their clothes, nor their arms were
handsome or genuine. Wheresoever the great army of
Baedecker-reading tourists turns, there one finds trickery,
exaction, and these so-called national displays. The
Pyramids are as much a station for tourists as the Rigi;
and the hired Bedouins, with their foolish tricks, belong
to the same category as the wooden Chamois which you
find stuck up in Switzerland.
