STORKS AT EL-AUDyE. 355





in these meadows, too, the voice of the Lord was heard"Thou art My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

Great processions of faithful pilgrims come year by
year to bathe in the Jordan and bear back some of its
water for the baptism of their children. The orthodox
bathe in the sacred river in the same garment which they
propose to reserve for the day of their death.

Strengthened and refreshed by our bath, we hastened,
followed by the Bedouins, to retrace our path up the wild
boar track, across the bottom of the valley, and up to the
edge of the plateau from which we had descended. We
mounted our horses, and, under Salim's guidance, rode full
gallop athwart the steppe. Near the entrance of the
narrow valley of El-Audie the governor and some gendarmes met us. Our long delay and the direction we had
taken towards the Jordan had made him uneasy, and he
had come out to look for us. The spot where we had
begun our sport in the morning had to be passed, and then
we turned towards the interior of the valley, which is
clothed with rich verdure, while the hills that enclose it
maintain the same character as the rest of the border
mountains-long steep slopes scantily covered with grass.
Our narrow and seemingly interminable path led us up
the valley through thick and thorny bush, now and again
crossing to the opposite bank of a stony brook. Innumerable storks stood on the steeps. I have never seen such
quantities of these birds assembled in one spot as here,
notably in the valley of El-Audje, and generally in the
whole of the plain of the Jordan.

After a prolonged ride we at length reached our camp.
