256 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



according to which the level of the Red Sea was 9908
metres higher than that of the Mediterranean. The
possibility of direct communication appeared thereby to be
an insoluble question, until at length, in the fourth decade
of this century, accurate measurement showed the huge
blunder in Lep? ere's reckoning. After Lesseps had obtained
the concession from the Viceroy Said Pasha for the cutting of
the isthmus, the difficult work was begun in April, 1858,
and on the 16th of November, 1869, the opening of the
maritime canal was celebrated with lavish splendour. The
cost of its execution amounted to nineteen millions sterling.

"A necessary preliminary to the works of the canal was
the creation of a sweet-water canal for the supply of the
labourers at the canal, and hereafter of the Port of Suez, with
potable water. In the vicinity of Kasr-en-N il a canal was
carried in a straight line from the Nile to Heliopolis, and
thence in a north-easterly direction. Wadi TOmilat was
cut through, and finally the western side of the Crocodile and
Bitter Lakes was selected as the line of the canal to Suez."

We may here close the interesting notes which my
friend sent to me, and return to the canal and our French
steamer. We soon reached the Bitter Lakes, which have
a certain undeniable charm in the matter of scenery; the
contrast between the dark-blue waters and the dazzling
white of the desert cannot fail to arrest the traveller's
attention. In the narrow reach of the canal between the
Bitter and Timshh Lakes we observed a jackal close to the
bank, looking for shell-fish. Some fruitless shots were sent
at him. By the deep-blue waters of Lake Timsith we
again enjoyed the splendours of an African sunset.
