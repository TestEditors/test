Mo TRAVELS [ N THE EAST,



We must now turn from the valuable remarks of the
most learned of Egyptian historians to the chronicle of our
own movements.

A French canal steamer took us over the beautiful bluegreen waters of the Red Sea to the Arabian coast. We

on small donkeys. We had trodden Asiatic ground for the
