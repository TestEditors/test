HILLS AROUND BETHLEHEM. 311



he took part in the campaign of 1870, and returned, soon
after the conclusion of peace, to his own home to shoot
partridges as before.

Hoyos and I now set forth with this pair to search
the country for game for the afternoon. Advancing into
a valley eastward, we passed some flocks. The picturesquely clad shepherds pleased me much. Those who
first worshipped by the cradle of the Son of God were
surely such as those who now roamed the hills with their
goats, singing monotonous songs.

The hills rose higher and steeper, and were covered
with yellow grass. I noticed that there was already a
change in the character of the flora. Betsahur is the
last village in this direction, and at the beginning of the
grey-green mountains and of the flora of the Jordan,
the territory of the Bedouin tribes is entered, where a
certain amount of caution must be exercised.

We clambered eagerly about on the hills. We saw and
heard some partridges, but the few that are to be met with
in the neighbourhood of Bethlehem are so wild there is
little chance of getting up to them. We roamed with our
experienced huntsmen over some hills back towards the
village, entering the region of olive trees and neglected
gardens.

Southward from the ridge on which Bethlehem and
Betsahur stand is a deeply indented valley whose sides
have terraces of olives and vines; between these rise rocky
cliffs with piled-up stones, forming niches and hollows

covered with evergreens, giving a most picturesque aspect
to the whole.
