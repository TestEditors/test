BAISA'M - 365



powerful grey-bearded man with a leather-thonged whip
in his hand, as sign of authority, rode in front to show the
most direct way. It was a glorious gallop along the steppe,
across country, pursued by the great fire, a spectacle
which the vastness of other continents can seldom rival.
A wild boar, fleeing like ourselves from the fire, rushed
past my horse at the distance of but a few paces.

A long hand gallop brought us quickly across the
steppe and through a region'overgrown with tall longthorned thistles which distressed both us and the horses.
At the end of two hours the character of the country began
to change. The valley grew broader, and low green hills
rose in its midst, covered with bushes and dwarf oak. To
the north the view was closed in by fine mountains: the
spurs of Carmel, the mountains round Nazareth, the lofty
Tabor with its distinctive outline, the Anti-Lebanon and
the snow-clad Hermon, the mountains of the Sea of
Gennesareth (the Tabariye of the Arabs)', and to the east
the heights of Djebel Adjhtm could all be distinguished,
thrown up in effective light. Our way led past a
little Bedouin burying-ground. Two wonderful ancient
sycamores gave the gloomy spot a still more dismal
aspect.

We gradually approached the goal of our day's journey,
the village of Baishn. The famous well region of this place
extends round it in a wide circle. In all directions small
watercourses break forth from the plateau, and thick low
bushes, tall reed grass, morass, and marshy places fill the
neighbourhood. The cry of the blackcock, which is
found here in immense quantities, is heard on all sides.
