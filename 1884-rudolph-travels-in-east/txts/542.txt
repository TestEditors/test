362 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



Nowhere in the Valley of the Jordan had we found a
region at once so accentuated in line and form, and so poor
in vegetation, as that across which we journeyed in the
first hours of this day. A great number of birds of prey

We had next a toilsome climb up a projecting spur of

course of the water along the higher margin of the rocks, I
