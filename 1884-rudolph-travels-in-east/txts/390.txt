children of spring, who resign to the world of light unlimited
sway over the ground, and have modestly retreated to the
black soil on the banks of the Nile.

"Egypt has been formerly rightly described by writers
of antiquity as a gift from its mighty river. The geological
investigations of modern science have only confirmed this
view. After the Nile in its northward course has penetrated through granite and sandstone, and. formed the
waterfalls of the cataracts in the most obstructed part, it
enters the region of pebble formation, and makes its
way to the sea by those long reaches which now form the
Nile Valley proper. North of Cairo the sea was a wide
bay, whose left or western side touched the Libyan, and the
right the Arabian desert. Geological investigations based
on the prehistoric remains of animal and vegetable life
found in the soil of the desert during the making of the
Canal of Suez, have furnished indefeasible proofs that the
Isthmus of Suez was once the meeting point of the two
