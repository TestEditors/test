IOP. TRAVELS AV THE EAST.



directions, and only our guides and donkey-drivers went
with us.

One of the latter seems in his leisure hours to follow the
craft, so favoured by the Egyptians, of serpent-charming,
for on the march he drew out of a leather pouch which he
carried hidden under .his wide robe, two very large and
imposing-looking spectacle serpents which he had captured
the day before near the lake. He of course performed the
familiar trick of breathing on the serpents, whereupon they
lie stiff and as though dead. In a few minutes, the muchtormented creatures, who have been rendered harmless by
the extraction of their fangs, recover and creep back again
into the brown pouch. As we were riding at foot's pace,
the dachshunds ran beside the horses, but when the
caravan approached a small and wretched village, adorned
only by some extremely fine palms and sycamores, the
eager dachshunds disappeared into an insignificant square
bean-field, and forthwith began a lively hunt. We jumped
from our horses and surrounded the field, which could be
shot across from one side to the other. In this narrow
space the hunt went up and down for a quarter of an hour.
Twice the ichneumon put its head out close beside a gun,
but no one could fire because of his neighbour. The
cunning beast knew his danger, let himself be driven up
and down by the dogs, but never left his secure cover.

As time pressed, we had to whip the dogs in and
continue our journey, without having done what we wished.

The road led us past a railway, b. short branch line,
which leads for purposes of transport from the factory at
Abuskar to the principal sugar-cane plantations.
