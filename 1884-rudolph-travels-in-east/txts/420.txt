276 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



five cupolas, the Mount of Olives, and to the right the
Greek Convent of the Crucifixion. The Holy City itself
we could not yet see.

On the road there was a great triumphal arch with
a Hungarian inscription. The Jewish colony stood beside
it with banners, singing the National Hymn. With many
compliments and the usual talk and noise the patriotic
Jews surrounded us. They were genuine Israelites from
the north of Hungary. They wore the caftan, high
boots, the velvet cap, the curled beard, and the accustomed
ringlets. You might have supposed you were in a
Carpathian village.

The whole Jewish community followed us from this
point as a matter of course. Both sides of the road were
already thronged with people. Jews of all countries,
Christians from Asia Minor, Greeks, European pilgrims,
Oriental Christian women, some partly and some not at
all veiled, in most picturesque costumes only to be likened
to those of Hebrew women of old, very Madonnas in form
and figure; beside them Copts, English tourists with
their exterior so destructive of all poetry, Mohammedan
country people, crippled beggars, and an indescribable
medley from the very ends of the earth-all these idly
loitering in the streets and looking curiously at us.

The procession stood drawn up, awaiting our arrival,
at the point from which one first beholds Jerusalem.
Every one knelt to pray with bared head. The holy
Zion, with its ancient walls, its grey white circular houses,
the cupolas of the Church of the Sepulchre, and the great
Mosque of Omar were all before us.
