156 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



the river divides into branches, we put in, and walked along
the rocky bank to a point which afforded a view over the
wild rocks and tossing waters. The cataracts are not
waterfalls, but rapids. Thousands of rocky islets, cliffs, and
reefs fill the bed of the river for more than a kilometer.
Through these the river, foaming and roaring, makes its
way. It is, without question, a grand scene, and its peculiar
charm is enhanced by the striking black colour, and the
shape of the reefs and shoals of rocks which rise through
the white froth of the flood. It is interesting, too, to see
the ordinarily sluggish, turbid Nile converted for a brief
space into a raging mountain stream.

The moment we had reached the best point of view, a
number of naked Nubians appeared, jumped into the
waves, and, avoiding the rocks, allowed themselves to
be swept along through the most furious and rapid
of the arms of the river. In a few seconds they were
carried, swift as arrows sped from a bow, a long way down,
and then scrambled out of the water to come to us
dripping and Glamorous for backsheesh. Returning to the
boat, we were rowed a short way up stream, and then,
mounting the asses which awaited us, rode back to Assuan
by the same way by which we had come in the morning.

The excursion had taken the whole day, and it was late
in the afternoon when we reached our steamer. We dined
at once, and after dinner Hoyos and I went again, as
twilight came on, to the hiding-places which we had
occupied the day before. My huntsman urged us to do
this, because, while we were in Philae, he had found fresh
tracks of hyaenas by the remains of the carrion.
