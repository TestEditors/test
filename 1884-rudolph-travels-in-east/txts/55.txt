APPROACH TO AFRICA. 19



hours on the deck, enjoying the sparkle of the sea beneath
the radiant moonlight of the south.

The following day, as calm and fine as its predecessor,
was spent by us on the open sea. In the early morning
Candia was still in sight. The wonderful Mount Ida and
the other high mountains of this island were shrouded in
deep snow. By noon the vicinity of Africa made itself
very perceptible, and we enjoyed for the first time the all..
pervading heat. How delightful it was to lie on the deck,
basking in the southern sun, and to think of the cold we
had been enduring but a few days before in the centre of
ice-bound Europe. We passed one of Lloyd's steamers;
but, except this, all was still on the broad expanse of water.

We awoke on the 18th February to splendid weather.
"Land in sight yet?" was the first question. Nothing
but water so far as the eye could reach. At eight am.
the coast of Africa rose slowly into view, and some minarets
of Alexandria appeared on the horizon. They were.
greeted with exultation by the whole travelling party.

For the second time it was given me to see the Dark
Continent. The first time I had admired the rocky shores
of the Atlas region; now I was rejoicing at the sight of
the low-lying strand of sacred Egypt.
