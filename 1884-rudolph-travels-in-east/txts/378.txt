242 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



Lake, a monument of Ramses II. is found near Mas-Chile,
together with sphinxes, inscribed stones, and the remains
of old brick buildings. Lesseps and the greater number of
scholars have identified this site with that of the town
Ramses of the Scriptures; and the name of Ramses has for
this reason been given to the railway station.

Leaving the Wadi the line passes to the terminal station
of Ismailia. Its further course across the desert along the
western shore of the Bitter Lakes, both northern and
southern, affords some interest from the view across their
shining blue waters, and to the westward by the sight of
the picturesquely shaped Mount Geneffe, whose quarries,
especially in parts where the stone is almost of the quality
of marble, are extensively worked at the present day. At
last we catch sight of the dark and imposing Mount Ataka,
and soon after the azure blue mirror of the sea tells that we
approach the part of Suez.

One is surprised as one enters the station by the sight
of the harbour alive with the ships of all nations, among
which the Indiamen claim the first place, both in size and
equipment. The town, which we reached late in the
afternoon, is tasteless and unimportant; its wretched hotels
and the private houses of the consuls, in no style at all, give
it a Western character; nordo the numerous wharves and
harbour buildings enhance its beauty.

The great historic importance of the scene alone gives
it real interest, and lends a charm to the smooth surface of
the Red Sea, and the picturesque but sad and gloomy coast
which surrounds it. We were tired by the hot journey,
and went direct to our hotel to dine.
