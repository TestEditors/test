After we had scrambled into the Pyramid of King
Pepi I. with some pains and difficulty, we left the desert
and its ancient monuments and rode back into the cultivated land.

The road led past a plantation of areca, a very attractive plant for hunting reasons, and we resolved to have it
beaten by our servants and some fellaheen, but unluckily
the owner suddenly appeared and desired us not to trespass
on his property.

This inflexible personage was an old negro, a eunuch'
of giant size, but thin, with rather flaccid features, and robed
in long wide garments-one of the ugliest and most
offensive-looking men that I ever remember to have seen.
In his respectable career he had acquired a great deal of
money, and now spent his old age on his own extensive
estate. Avoiding a dispute with this individual, we rode
at one stretch to Bedrashtn, whence the railway brought
the whole party in less than an hour to Cairo. After this
long expedition, full of the most delightful experiences, we
re-entered the beautiful City of the Caliphs.
