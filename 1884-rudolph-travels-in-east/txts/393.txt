LEIBNITZ AND THE CANAL OF SUEZ. 255



an oracle warned him that he was only working for the
barbarians, i.e. for foreigners. The Persian kings Cambyses
and Darius I., a hundred years after Necho, were less alarmed
at such munitions, and completed the communication between
the Nile and the Red Sea. The remains of this canal
were found in our own day in the cutting of the isthmus,
and the ruins found close at hand of buildings with Persian
inscriptions mark three stations on the long line of water
which led from the Crocodile Lake to the Gulf of Suez.
A further extension of the system of canals was made
under the Ptolemies. A branch canal was carried from
Phakusa (now Fakus) on the Pelusian arm of the Nile
into Lake Menzaleh; from thence the Dattel Lake could
be reached, which in its turn was connected with the
Crocodile and Bitter Lakes. In this way the Mediterranean and Red Seas were united at their nearest points,
and a waterway created, which for the then commercial
traffic of the world was of the greatest value. Under the
Romans these works fell into decay, until Amru, the well,
known general of the Caliph Omar, made it his business to
restore the old sea-way and to place Cairo in communication
with Suez by a canal. In the eighth century of our era this
canal was no longer navigable. In the year 1671 Leibnitz,
in a plan which he submitted to Louis XIV., set forth the
importance and necessity of canal communication between
the two seas. His proposal obtained no attention. When
General Buonaparte made his famous expedition to Egypt
the importance of a communication between the seas did
not escape him. The execution of such a project failed
through the faulty calculations of the engineer Lepere,
