hand."

The udders of the cow are placed in the middle by
its left leg.

The surfaces of the cow are covered with inscriptions;
those towards the middle of the hind leg are --" The outer
heavens," and "I am where I am," and "I do not let her
turn back." The inscription below the ship, which stands
in front, is, "Rest not, my son."

Those which are written in the opposite direction run,
"Thy bearing is life-like;" another, "The eternal is
expressed therein," and "Thy son is yonder;" another,
"Life, happiness, and health be granted to these thy
nostrils."

The inscription behind the Cloud-god Shu, by his arms,
is, "Her guardian; "that which is behind him, by his feet,
and written in the opposite direction, is, "The truth;"
another, "They enter in;" and another, "I am the daily
protector.".

The inscription which is under the arm of the figure
which stands beneath and behind the left leg runs, "The
closer up of all things."

That which stands over the head of the figure at the
hind quarters of the cow and near its legs is, "Guardian of
her going out."

That which is behind the two figures who stand at
the cow's leg, and is written above their heads, runs, "The
old man who sings praises at his going out," and "The old
man who adores at his coming in."
