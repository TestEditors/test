FAREWELL TO THE EAST. 377



ported to the cradle of humanity where Paradise stood--.
to the sacred, golden, glorious East.

Descending by a narrow street of the little town of Haifa,
which is built in terraces on the steep slopes of Mount
Carmel, we soon reached the quay. One step more on
Eastern soil, one last look on the brightly coloured throng of
human life, and our hard parting from the East was over.
A boat from the Miramar bore us over the swaying waters
to the ship which lay at anchor.
