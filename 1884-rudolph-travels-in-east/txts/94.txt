46 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



After a short stay we left the hot rooms, from which
the horrible smell and the multitude of flies soon bid the
Western stranger to retreat.

Our course next lay past three mosques, remarkable for

its well-known gate, Bhb-el-Futtlh. Both the above-mentioned gates-the one signifying victory, and the other
conquest-spring from the same time, and were built under

points of the brilliantly coloured picture.
