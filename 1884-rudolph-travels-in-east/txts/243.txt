THE ABABDEHS. 145



themselves wear, articles of dress for Nubian ladies-i.e. a
string from which small cords hang, dipped, because of
the flies, in fearful smelling unguents-straw hats for the
wild tribes, and trifles of all kinds.

Over the doors of many houses I saw stuffed young
crocodiles nailed up; and tame apes sat at the doors. I
bought myself one which afforded us much amusement, but
unfortunately it died at Cairo.

The life and stir of the bazaar was very interesting.
The Ababdehs especially interested me by their warlike
appearance, armed to the teeth, scantily clad in a few rags,
and with a peculiar arrangement of the hair.

The various savages looked at us with curiosity, and
the sly Arabs with crafty cunning sold us African wares at
high prices, adroitly profiting by our evident interest in
them.

On an open space between the houses and the landingplace the Ababdehs performed their war-dance for us. It is
nothing more than the wild jumping to and fro of savages'
in the very lowest stage of development. The accompanying music, consisting of horrible droning pewter tamtams,
reminded me of the jingle which resounds at the dances of
negro slaves in Morocco, but the dance itself resembled the
unbridled amusements of the reef pirates of the north
coast of N orth-West Africa.

The worthy Ababdehs jumped about to the utmost of
their bodily powers, and executed leaps of incredible length,
howling and screaming at the same time. They swung
and hurled swords and spears aloft, rapped with them on
their leathern shields, and feigned attacks upon one another.
