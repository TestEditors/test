160 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



in terror. Immediately after, seeing a black body bigger
than a wolf approach the lure, I took exact aim and fired.
A furious howl of pain followed the shot. I hastened to the
spot, but found only the track, which led to the mountains.
Vexed and disappointed at this, and convinced that I had
hit a hyaena, we returned to the steamer. I desired my
huntsman to go out at daybreak next morning and follow
the track of the wounded beast.

When we reached the steamer the other gentlemen
had already returned. The Grand Duke had seen jackals,
but unfortunately shot none, while Hoyos had been so
lucky as to kill one.

On the 10th the sun stood high in the heavens ere I
awoke, and we had already been going down stream for
more than an hour. Asking for my huntsman, I learned
that he had found the wounded animal a few hundred steps
from where it had been shot; but it was, alas! no hyaena,
but one of those half-savage and most vicious village dogs
which in Egypt wander the whole night through in the
neighbourhood of towns, looking for prey. My huntsman
saw also a very large lynx within a few steps of him, which
disappeared into a hole in the old wall of El-Khb.

May I be allowed here to say a few words about the
race of dogs in Egypt P I have made the curious observation that in this country the village dog, the African wolf
(Canis Jupastee), "Abu-el-Hossain "or "Dib" of the Arabs,
and the jackal (Canis aureus), tt Talib" of the Egyptians and
"Waui "of the Syrians, mix races through cross breeding.

We shot no two wolves nor any two jackals which
were entirely like one another, either in size or colour.
