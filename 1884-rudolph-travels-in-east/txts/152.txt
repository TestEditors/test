to take to the water, as the distance was, in fact, a considerable one. I hastened back to the camp to summon
more assistance. When I returned I saw, to my great joy,
a brown fellow already near the pelican in the foaming
waves. The Grand Duke was in ambush not far off, and
when he saw the dead bird, had despatched his companion,
a bold swimmer, into the flood.

After a few minutes the brave Arab returned, drawing
the heavy bird after him by the beak as he swam. I was
glad of my first pelican. It was an exceptionally large
specimen. In the evening hours I went up and down on
the shore, on the look-out for the small strand birds.

When it was too dark to shoot, the gentlemen all
came in to dinner. Again there was a fair show of game.
After our interesting day, slumber soon settled over
the camp.

We were to have rowed early the next morning to the
opposite side of the island, to await on a tongue of land
the passage of the birds. During the night, alas! the
weather grew still worse, and before sunrise the storm
had increased so much that the boatmen refused to put out.
There was nothing to be done but to pass one more day on
the island. We all slept late, and went in the forenoon
with the dogs to the rocks, where we searched in vain; no
lynx was to be found. The rest of the day was therefore
devoted to the strand.

The water-fowl flew untowardly for us, carefully avoid-.
ing the island. Towards evening I made the circuit of the
whole island, and shot a fine Berber falcon and some strand
birds, and also a raven.
