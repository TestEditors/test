198 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



father speaks with his son while he spake thus:'Behold
me, and consider me well, thou my son Thutmes. I am thy
father Hormachu, the god Cheper-Ra-Tum. The kingdom shall be given to thee; thou shalt wear the crown of
Egypt on the throne of the god of the earth Keb; the whole
earth shall belong to thee, in its breadth and length, lighted
by the beaming eye of the Lord of all. The riches from
the interior of the land, and many tributes from all people,
shall belong to thee, and thou shalt rejoice in length of life
for many years. The best shall be thy portion, for my face
is turned to thee, and my heart belongs to thee. The sand
of the desert on which I have my being has covered me
up. Answer me, that thou wilt do that which is my wish.
Then shall I know that thou art my son and defender.
Come nearer, let me be united to thee.'

"Upon this the prince awoke, and what he had just
heard was repeated. He understood the word of this
god, and kept it to himself in his heart while he thus spake:
' In very deed I see the dwellers in the temples of the town
of Memphis, how they bring sacrifices to this god without
doing anything to protect from the sands the work o',;
King Chafra, the image which he has set up to the god
Tum-Hormachu...."

The text is injured here, and has become illegible.
The conclusion is nevertheless easy to guess. Thutmes has
the Sphinx cleared of sand, and is in consequence crowned
King of Egypt. The fact is of small historic value, but all
the more interesting is the deduction that even in the
sixteenth century B.C. the body of the Sphinx lay as now,
half buried in deep sand.
