through the desolate ravine, closely bounded by the glaring
white mountains, to the kings' tombs at Biban-eI-Moluk,
where, in a cal de sac of steeply falling slopes and cliffs,
valley and path alike terminate, and the dark chasm
opens which leads down into the sepulchres of the earliest
dynasties. Armed with torches we entered those shrines
of a buried past.

I am indebted to Brugsch Pasha for many valuable
notes respecting this spot; so I will now allow him to
speak. tt The kings' tombs of Biban-el-Moluk are in a
side valley of the mountain, on which Nature herself seems
to have impressed the stillness of death. Here lay, buried
in deep caverns, the successive generations of the most
famous kings of the Theban dynasties, from the eighteenth
downward. The grave of Seti I., a true temple of the dead,
chiselled out of the rock, is reckoned the finest amongst
these remarkable structures. Steps, which descend with
perceptible tracks for the carriage of the sarcophagus, lead.
into the dark depths, from passage to passage, from chamber
to chamber, which, in spite of all the inroads of decay, still
display pictures and inscriptions in the most perfect colours.
By the dim light we follow the long series of scenes, which
take us into the realms of the dead in the world beyond,
and bring the different regions of the lower world before
our eyes, depict the joys of the blessed in paradise, the
torments of the damned, the starry heavens, and the subterranean voyage of the vessel of the sun in its course from
west to east, from death to life, through night and darkness; in a word, unroll for us in picture or I, word,
with the utmost detail, the mysterious pages of life beyond
