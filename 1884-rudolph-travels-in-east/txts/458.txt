304 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



it had brought the entire ass-mot dragged it along, but
carried it on its back. Hyaenas are very large and strong,
but they are not, in my opinion, capable of doing so much
as this; neither are they accustomed to carry off their booty
without touching it. Those are the ways of the bear, and
I feel convinced that a yellow Syrian Isabel-bear, which

have had a splendid night. So, vexed, and out of humour, I
went back to breakfast at the castle. It was very lively on
the road. Caravans of asses and camels laden with provisions came in from the country to the market in Jerusalem,
and one saw varied costumes as well as interesting types
both of men and women.

Our luggage and the whole column of beasts of burden,

gentlemen were to spend the forenoon in Jerusalem, and
would not arrive at Tantur before noon. I employed the
spare time in watching at the ambush for large birds of prey.
The head of the ass had in the meantime been dragged
up to the shed, and I had plans for employing poison the

come from the mountains of the Dead Sea to the towns,
and especially to Jerusalem, to gather up the carrion.
