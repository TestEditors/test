FAREWELL TO EGYPT. 261



canal buildings, the ships' docks, building yards and workshops, the vessels, and especially the Indiamen, lend the
whole scene a purely Western aspect.

Late in the day we gave a dinner on board the Miramar,
to which Abd-el-Kader Pasha and the French gentlemen
were invited; when it grew dark our countrymen who
reside here improvised a beautiful illumination of the
harbour and a procession of boats. Several brightly
illuminated boats with bands of music flitted round our
vessel, and brilliant fireworks were let off on land.

The hour of separation soon came. Our guests left
the Miramar, and Abd-el-Kader Pasha also. We had all
learnt to value and respect him. He had been a faithful
companion to us and a true friend.

We had passed glorious never-to-be-forgotten days in
Africa, and bore away with us impressions of ancient
grandeur from the Dark Continent and from radiant Egypt,
from the graves of thousands of years of an ancient but
now vanished civilization.
