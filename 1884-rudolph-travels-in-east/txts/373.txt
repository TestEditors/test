THE HOWLING DERVISHES. 237



which the upper part of the body was thrown backwards
and forwards; these dervishes called, moaned, groaned,
and howled the same words in quite inarticulate sounds.
The whole scene was painfully dismal. The men wore
long bright robes like dressing-gowns, with a simple cord
round the waist. In contrast to all other Moslems they
had no covering on the head, and long shaggy hair.and
beards. When they threw their bodies backwards the hair
reached the ground, and when they pitched forward the
hair fell in wild disorder over their faces. Their eyes
turned, and their bodies twitched convulsively, and foam
and froth covered their lips; one big man especially, with a
black beard, was a type of the wildest fanatical ecstasy.

We did not stay long in this oppressive atmosphere,
and the old high priest and all his underlines followed us
out. In the open air they all covered their heads, for the
most part with brown caps, and proceeded to serve some
very unsatisfactory coffee in their primitive arbour.

I inquired their descent. Like the turning dervishes,
they all spoke Turkish; none of them were Arabs. The
old high priest was from Greece, a pure Osmanli. The
others were Turks from Stamboul, Roumelia, and the other
Balkan provinces; Moslems, too, from the Crimea and Asia
Minor, and one Kurd from Bagdad, with a huge green
turban, were present.

We took leave after a short stay and drove back to
Kasr-en-Nusha. Time pressed, for we were to appear on
this day, without uniform, at a small private dinner at the
Khedive's. We came home soon after dinner, as the
Viceroy had to go in the evening to the Hussein Mosque
