us to form a correctjudgment as to their style of building,
and the mode of its execution. The grave-chamber has
mostly a pointed roof formed by two limestone monoliths,
which lean'against each other, sloping upwards. This
must be regarded as the essential point of every pyramid.
The covering of limestone blocks piled over it takes the
form of a pyramid. The angles of a pyramid were called
in old Egyptian Pir-am-us; hence the Greek name Pyramis.

The pyramid was added to according to the length of

the eye of the spectator their chronological order also.

The entrance to the Pyramids is always turned to the

The greater number of the Pyramids had been opened

sought for buried treasure. In our days the attempt has
