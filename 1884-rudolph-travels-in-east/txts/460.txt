306 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



along which it extends for some distance. Between the
stony slopes level gardens of olives and vines are planted,
which give the place an air of sheltered verdure. The
houses built of white stone with flat roofs, the cupolas and
towers of the churches, the terraces and the convents, all

street; uneven pavement, rough woodwork, gloomy walls,
and an incessant up and down hill are the first impression

ethnographic study, for Bethlehem is far more than Jerusalem the type of an old Hebrew town. The people
whom one sees on the flat roofs of their houses, in the

garb of the Pharisees, and the poor like those who heard

and with the most beautiful eyes, features, and hair that
can be imagined. I have never seen such beautiful women
as in Bethlehem, and nowhere else so many of them in one
town. One beauty follows another. The noblest Madonna
