THE RISE OF CAIRO. 43



and when, under Caliph Othmén, Arabians settled in the
valley of the Nile, Fostét became the centre of government.
A school of learning was already in existence there when
Caliph Mtm (8r3-833), the son of Hartin al-Raschid,
visited Egypt. Fostht became still more prosperous under
the Governor Ahmed ibn Tultin, who made himself Sultan
of Egypt, and his building-loving successors. Scarcely a
hundred years later, Fostéit lost its position as capital, when
Djéhar, general of Sultan Muizz, who had become ruler of
Maghreb (Tunis), conquered Fosttt in the name of his
master, and founded a new capital not far from the old

called it Masr-el-kthira.

Cairo thus became the capital of the empire of the
Fétimee Caliphs, and advanced rapidly.

Muizz, son and successor of Aziz Billt1h, founded the
university, el-Azhar. Under his successor, Hakim, the town

walls, bestowed no less care on the city than the Feitimee
Caliphs had done. Several of the Mameluke Sultans, notably
Kalatin, El-Aschref-Chalil, Hassan, Barkilk, Kait-Bey and
El-GMri, adorned the town with handsome buildings, while
the inhabitants, it is true, suffered from the unbridled

further growth of Cairo. After the battle of Heliopolis, he
took Cairo by storm. The last of the Mameluke Sultans,
Tiims1n-Bey, was hung at Btb-es-Zuwtle, April 15th, 1517,
