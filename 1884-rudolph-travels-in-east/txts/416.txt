272 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



first the road penetrated a narrow valley, its steep slopes
to right and left being covered with rocks and thick
evergreens. The character of the flora in these regions
is distinctly Mediterranean, such as one finds it on the
coasts of Spain, Greece, Italy, and the western parts
of North Africa, especially Morocco. In Palestine this
zone is a narrow one, and, disappearing gradually at
Jerusalem, gives place eastward of Bethlehem to the
vegetation of the steppes and of the interior of Asia.

Passing the old well Bir-Egyub (Well of Job), we
came through the ravine of Wadi Ali and by the ruins
of an old mosque to the ridge of the hills. Their
appearance is uniform-nothing but dazzling white rocks
separated from each other by thorny bushes. Here and
there tumbling houses or ruins appear among the rocks.
There are few cliffs, but, on the other hand, there are
numerous long and quite smooth slabs on the declivities
of the hills.

Innumerable eagles and vultures soared in the air,
but among the shrubs we saw very few birds; occasional
partridges ran swiftly up the slopes. After two hours of
travel we attempted deer-stalking along the top of the
hills with our Arab huntsmen..

A fine view opened before us into a stretch of vales
and ravines-always the same in character, with a
Mediterranean flora like that of the mountains of Zante.
In the far east we saw the yellow-grey ridges and tops of
the plateau on which Jerusalem lies, and the commencement of the chain of hills in the interior'of the country,
which have a totally different aspect.
