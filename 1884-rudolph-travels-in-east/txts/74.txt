34 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



in front, in the midday haze, as though veiled in orange
grey, are the Pyramids of Ghiz√©h. It is a solemn moment,
and unbidden thoughts of grave import -fill the mind of the
traveller, who sees for the first time with his own eyes
these tokens of a civilization which flourished in long-past
"ages, in this everlasting land of the Pharaohs, which is the
corner-stone of the history of the world.

To the south-east the table-like desert mountains of
Mokattam rise in masses. Below them are the walls of the
citadel and the minarets of the mosque of Mehmet Ali.
Between alLthese, in the hot mist, lies the sea of houses of
the chief city of Africa. The nearer we approach to the
ancient, much-praised city of the Caliph, the more luxuriant
are the gardens beside the railway. Forests of palms and
sycamores surround isolated houses, and at length the dark
green of the Schubra Avenue opens on our view. In a few
minutes the train enters the station.

The Viceroy, surrounded by his officers of state, stood
on the steps with most friendly greetings.

The numerous members of the large Austro-Hungarian
colony received their countrymen with resounding ovations.
We went to the carriages in waiting-handsome thoroughly
European equipages--a battalion of infantry playing the
National Hymn in our honour. The first sight of life in
Cairo is enchanting. We drove through a short street to
the bridge which crosses the canal, and into the rich green
of the shady Schubra Avenue. One picture follows another,
and as in a dream the most bewitching scenes pass before
the eye. Crowds of human beings move to and fro; heavyladen Camels, small asses, noisy Orientals in coloured.
