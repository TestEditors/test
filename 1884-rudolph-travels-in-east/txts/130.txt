72 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



The line lay at first beside the narrow strip of tilled land
which stretches along between the western bank of the
river Nile and the desert. The thorough character of
Egyptian cultivation was very apparent here-high-pressure
tillage confined to a narrow space. Simple fellaheen
villages alternated with palm forests, larger than those of
Lower Egypt. Townships, one might almost say, of
circular dovecotes, built in Arab mode, struck us. Doves
are here provided with shelter and protection only for the
sake of the valuable guano they afford. Occasionally their
eggs and down are made use of. These birds never acquire
a domesticated character. In colour and size they are true
rock pigeons, and are quite untamed in habits.

The line often approaches the Nile, always on the left
bank. To the east the desert mountains advance close
to the stream; to the west, on the other hand, lies the
wave-like, moving, almost flat, Libyan desert.

The railway passes all the Pyramids, and, in fact, near
enough to see them well. At first, the grey heads of Ghiz√©h
appear, the proudest of their race. Next come to view the
smaller members of the family, those of Sakkara. We
Europeans are accustomed to see a solitary palm in a
hothouse, or on the southern coast of our scantily portioned
quarter of the globe. Only in the rustling, far-spreading
palm forest has this tree its full significance as the symbol
of sunny Africa.

At ten in the morning our train turned from the
main line, which follows the course of the Nile to Siut,
and took us along a branch-line westward into the bare
and barren desert. A railway journey in such a region,
