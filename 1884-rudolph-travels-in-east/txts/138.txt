80 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



across the smiling fields and the grey-green shrubs on the
shore to the broad mirrored lake of Birket-el-Karun, and
beyond it to the long orange outline of the desert of
Sahara.

An eagle buzzard, a bird of African race, stood on a low
hillock not far from our line of march. I jumped off my
horse and crept up to him, but failed with too weak shot.
The confiding bird only came nearer to me, and I fired
again, but once more without success; this only moved him
to flutter still closer, and so it went on till the fourth shot,
despite the inadequate loading, laid him low.

Soon after this brief interlude, we came to a miserable
poverty-stricken village. Low and, for the most part,
ruinous clay huts were unworthy of the splendid accessories
of towering palms and wide-spreading sycamores. The
inhabitants came out in airy garments and the children in
entire nakedness to look at us. The road turned at the
village, and soon brought us to the shore of the lake.

As soon as all the horses and beasts of burden were
unladen, we got into boats. They were, in truth, sorry
craft; worse one could not imagine in the days of our ancestors and their lake-dwellings. The square, flat boxes were
slowly propelled by five or six strong fellows with oars of
the most primitive description. The inside was full of old
fishbones, and the stench of filth of various kinds, and in
particular of putrefying fish, was so strong that nothing but
incessant smoking could even partially protect us.

The fishermen in old Egyptian times probably used no
other, and certainly no worse, boats than their brethren of
to-day use on the Birket-el-Karun.
