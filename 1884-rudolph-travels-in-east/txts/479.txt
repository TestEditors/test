DESCENT TO THE VALLEY OF THE? ORDAN. 321



At the end of an hour we left the chosen spot, and dragging
the kid with us, as we wished to put it out the next day,
we went down on foot into the bottom of the valley.
The lower we descended the heavier and more oppressive
grew the air. A leaden atmosphere came up the side
valley as a first greeting from the Dead Sea and the
Valley of the Jordan. We were to learn to dread it in
the next few days.

We soon reached the valley where our camp was
already completely pitched. It stood there like a small
town, and the utmost activity prevailed in the otherwise
lonely region.

The two Arab huntsmen who had followed the caravan,
shooting as they came along from Latrun, appeared with
an ample supply for the kitchen. They brought with them
some of the pretty little rock partridge. It was the first
time that we had come within the limits of diffusion of
this beautiful bird.

The Arabs, who with their imperfect weapons can only
shoot at sitting birds, creep up to their game under cover
of a brown or yellow painted curtain, which is stretched
upon two rods of sugar-cane, and gives sight and space to
fire through two openings for the eyes and one for the gun
barrel. The foolish birds see no one, and stare at the
moving curtain till the deadly shot issues from it.

We breakfasted as soon as we arrived, while the Oriental
servants with much dexterity made quarters for the night
possible. Every stone had to be moved and the whole of
the grass searched. Great fat scorpions lay about everywhere. We made full acquaintance with their bad qualities
