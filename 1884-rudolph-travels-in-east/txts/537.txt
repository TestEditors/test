OUR NEW SHEIK. M?



a red-legged cock partridge and a stark which was making
for its sleeping-place. Thousands of these long-billed
creatures came past our camp, and as many as could find
place settled on the low trees to rest. At sunset we all
returned to dine. As I fell asleep I heard close by the
tents the howl of hungry jackals.

Early on the 8th of April the servants struck the tents
and the caravan was again in motion. At first we had to
retrace the weary way through the side valley. In the
main valley things went better, and after a two hours' ride,
galloping along the good steppe ground at the foot of the
hills, we came to a marshy depression. Some scattered
clumps of bush and, unfortunately for us, a somewhat too
extensive morass marked the spot as hunting ground.
Salim and his agile allies were already there, but as his
circuit terminated here, another party of Bedouins were
awaiting our arrival, led by a very handsome sheik and
followed by many large dogs. The footmen were clad like.
Salim's people, but their leader seemed of a wealthier class.
His good chestnut caparisoned in rich trappings indicated
this, as well as his gay apparel, large coloured turban,
embroidered morocco slippers, and handsome Turkish
scimitar. His whole appearance bore the stamp of the
tribes of the interior of Asia rather than that of the pure
Arab.

He escorted the Grand Duke, Hoyos, and myself with
marked urbanity to our posts on the opposite side of
the thicket of reeds. The other gentlemen, with the
rest of the caravan, meanwhile pursued their further
march.
