TANTA--THE PYRAMIDS. 33



A little further, and we reach the famous old town of
Tanta. Seen from a distance, the town might be taken for
a heap of rubbish, surrounded by flowering gardens, palms,
and dusky sycamores. A nearer view shows the bustle of
ever-moving Eastern life, and the masses of houses built
of grey clay and tumbled, so to speak, on the top of one

Tanta is known for the fair held there thrice a year.

Lower Egypt, and mostly in the eastern Delta. They put

into most dreadful orgies. In ancient days these festivals
were in honour of the goddess Bubastis; now they are held
in that of Said of Tanta (Seyd-Achmed el-Bedawi), who died
here as a saint, A.D. 1200, but they maintain their character
for riotous dissipation.

The train stopped but for a few moments at Tanta.
The remainder of the journey brought similar scenes to

A great castle, standing amongst gardens, is known for
the dreadful deed done there. In 18 54, Abbas Pasha, son
of Tussum, who was governor in the days of Mehmet Ali,

A delightful moment is at hand, when the monotony of
the landscape of Lower Egypt draws to an end.

south-west, the yellow horizon of the Libyan desert; right
