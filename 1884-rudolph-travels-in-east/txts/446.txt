296 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



hill. We went up to the top by a winding path. A
small chapel with a kind of circular drum and insignificant
cupola covers the spot from which Christ ascended to
heairen. The prints of the Redeemer's feet remain on
a slab of marble.

The place belongs to the Mohammedans, and is held
sacred by them, but they permit the Christians to say
Mass there on certain days. By the chapel is a minaret;
sbme nariow steps lead first inside, and then, as usual, to
the outside. The rail is broken and the stones are
slippery, and not to be recommended to persons liable
to vertigo. From the summit there is a splendid view
of Jerusalem and the hills which divide the plateau and
the rieighbourhood of the Holy City and Bethlehem froth
the Valley of the Jordan. They' are grey-green hills
like steppes. In the remote distance one can discern
the high mountains east of the-Jordan and of the Dead
Sea, and through the inlet of a valley a glimpse is caught
of the dark-blue mirror of the inland sea.

The Mount of Olives and the buildings on it are
terribly neglected. The Garden of Gethsemane, at its
foot, alone bears trace of the care given to it by the
Franciscans, to whom it belongs. A monk lives in the
small house beside it to take charge.- The Mount of
Olives and Gethsemane wake most solemn thoughts.
Every stone attests the truth of tradition, and one seems
to behold the story of the Passion in living pictures.
I felt as though I had known these two spots all my
life; so completely did the reality accord with the
pictures which imagination had framed of them.
