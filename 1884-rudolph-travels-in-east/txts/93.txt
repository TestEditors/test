THE UNIVERSITY OF CAIRO. 45



of 1slam-Shafettes, Malekites, Hanefites, and Hambalites
--are attached in the rear. Innumerable coloured lamps
hang from the roof, and a decorated side chamber is shown
as the tomb of the saint Abd-er-Rahman-Kichya.

The most remarkable spectacle, however, by far, is
afforded by the ten thousand students from all Mohammedan countries who crowd the sanctuary no less than
the halls, courts, and vestibules of this great building.

The various types of humanity, from the black of the
negro to the pale yellow of the Cherkesse, are there
represented. The extraordinary combination of colour and
costume delights the eye; right studious Bedouins even, in
their white mantles, range themselves among the scholars.

The teachers sit on raised seats in little sheds made out
of plaited and Iatticed reeds; most comic figures they are,
mostly old, often deformed, in Oriental garb, turban on
head, and spectacles on nose. With the most ridiculous
gestures they shriek with hoarse voice their lecture at the
hearers. Old dusty Koran books, the pros and cons of
Eastern lore, lie before them, and with the help of a long
bamboo rod they maintain discipline and attention in the
ranks of their scholars. Round each teacher, squat, lie, or
sit on the bare earth a thickly set circle of apathetic-looking
youths. Some listen, others repeat aloud. It may be
imagined how noisily everything goes on in this so-called
High School and these interminable lecture-rooms. The
sight is perplexing indeed for any European, for it would
be difficult for us to conceive any more astonishing spectacle
than the course of proceedings in this world-renowned
University of Cairo.
