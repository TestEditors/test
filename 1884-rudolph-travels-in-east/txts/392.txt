254 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



surging waters from the sea have mingled with the currents
from the mouths of the Nile, and made that large basin of
shallow water with its many islands which extends from
Damietta to Port Said, and now bears the general name of
the Lakes of Menzaleh. The waters of these lakes are, or
rather were, in communication at this southern corner with
the Dattel Sea (Birket-el-ballah); southward in the same
direction came' The Threshold,' El-Gisr, of which we spoke
above. The waters of the Red Sea fed the basin of the
next following Crocodile Lake (Birketrel-Timsah) and the
Bitter Lakes, which were in direct connection with the
Gulf of Suez by means of the strip of canal of the' Crocodile's Tail.' It is therefore no wonder that the position
of these lakes between the two seas and near the N ile
awoke in the very early period of Egyptian history the
idea of connecting the lakes by a canal with the river, and
so indirectly restoring the communication between the
Mediterranean and the Red Sea.

"According to classical tradition Ramses II. (Sesostris,
the Sestura of inscriptions) was the first king who made a
navigable waterway by a canal from the Pelusian arm of
the Nile to the Crocodile Lake. This canal traversed
the natural depressed level of Wadi Ttrmiliit. The ruins of
towns and monuments which have perished, but which bear
the name of this king, place the existence of this canal
beyond all doubt. In later times the canal appears to have
fallen in, and been dried up until 600 B.c., when King
N echo made a plan to restore the connection between the
N ile and the Red Sea. He however abandoned his enterprise (in which 12,000 Egyptian labourers perished) when
