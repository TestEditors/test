SET FAST IN THE CANAL OF SUEZ. 221



The idea of moving along between two quarters of the
globe is exciting; but one ends by getting used even to
imposing ideas, and wearies of the tedious reality. Gigantic
flocks of pelicans and flamingoes stood by thousands and
thousands on the marshy southern parts of Lake Menzaleh.
We fired across at them, but with no other effect than that
of raising a living cloud larger than it is possible to conceive.

After the lake on our right had come to an end, the
surroundings were desolate indeed. The high banks shut
out all view, and earthworks right and left, however well
constructed, did not present a cheerful picture.

The only variety was meeting with a large English
Indiaman, which had awkwardly got athwart the canal
and blocked the way. Our captain thought we could pass,
and went boldly on. A severe wrench and some small
damage to our ship's sides, and there we were caught by
our English neighbour. We toiled for half an hour to get
free. The rough English captain kept his back turned
to us, as though the matter did not in the least concern.
him. At last there was a slight move, a creaking and
groaning of the jammed vessels, another wrench, and we
were free. We had floated the English vessel too by the
shock, and so each ship went her opposite way.

Later we got every now and then, from the captain's
bridge, a view over the bank across the Arabian desert,
the character of which is totally different from that of the
Libyan one. It is all much lighter, almost white, stone
as well as sand; flatter too, at most waving in gentle
sandhills; the numerous small, round, dark-green shrubs
also give it a peculiar aspect.
