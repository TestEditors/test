LISSA-ALBANIAN COAST. f



in store for us. The greater part of the travellers were
ill; and that depressed mood which the humours of the
tricksy sea produce in many persons was very apparent.
Sick and well sat on the deck looking at the unquiet
waves. About IO a.m. the steep cliffs of Lissa came in
sight. Every Austrian looks with emotion on that island,
the witness of the noble deeds of our heroic sailors.

In point of scenery Lissa has nothing to offer-a barren
stony island with cliffs and hills without variety or picturesque character.

In the afternoon the sea rose, and towards evening
flashes of lightning were followed by distant thunder. The
day passed monotonously, as the motion of the vessel forbade reading or writing, and our course lay far from the
coast on the open sea. The night was even worse, and the
sea-sick passengers could but endure, while the tedious
hours went by. The morning of the nth brought us at
sunrise a much quieter sea, and as we hastened on deck
the white summits of the Albanian mountains greeted us.
Much snow lay upon the highest tops.

The mountains of Albania have a special charm for the
traveller. From the ship you see them rise in terraced
layers, and catch glimpses of the fine rocky valleys, or
admire the cliffs which descend precipitously into the sea.

To me the mountains of the South are far more attractive
than the Alps of Central Europe. Their forms, the warmer
light, and the contrasts between snow, deep blue sky, and
southern vegetation are far more interesting than the
uniformity of the pine woods, with the dull, leaden, lightless
sky above.
