A M CKAL BETRA YED. 327



The story of the jackals appearing every evening
attracted me, and, obtaining leave from the monks, I crept
down all the ladders and galleries into the ravine, and
crouched beside some stones near an old tank. The spot
was stern and dismal-the bare rock in front, the rocky
habitations of the monks behind, above my head a narrow
strip of blue sky. As evening drew on the starlings,
falcons, and pigeons flew to their holes, and only now and
then the brief song of a bird was heard. One might fancy
one's self in the days of St. Saba.

It began to grow dark. The Greek bells called aloud
to prayer. The last sound had hardly died away when a
bit of bread fell close beside me; a moment after, and a
jackal stood not twenty steps off. A successful shot killed
him. I was glad to hurry up with my prey out of the
terrible gorge which is at the level of the Mediterranean.

A leaden air such as I never felt before seemed to stop
one's breath, and hang like a weight on the whole body.
In the next days we were to go lower still, and to be yet.
more oppressed by this malarious atmosphere.

I climbed the whole way up through the convent, and,
taking leave of the pious monks, we hastened out through
the tower at the top, but it was quite dark when we reached
our camp. We dined and made our plans for the next day,
and by ten stillness resumed its sway in the desolate valley.

At sunrise the party assembled at breakfast. We were
at table, when a carrion vulture had the audacity to stroll
into the camp and settle itself to consume some waste from
the kitchen between the tents. The Grand Duke fetched
his gun and shot the daring bird.
