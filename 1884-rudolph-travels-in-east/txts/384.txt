248 TRAVELS IN THE EAST,



vegetation became sandy wilds and unfruitful deserts. The
waters of inundation which had chiefly filled the Pelusian
branch were now borne to the western side of the Delta,
and the Canopic branch became a powerful stream. The
city of Alexandria, built in the neighbourhood of its mouth,
attracted to itself the commerce of the world under the
Ptolemies and the Romans, and raised itself into the
centre of all intellectual progress in religion, philosophy,
and literature. Its ancient importance has increased in our

which admits of quicker intercourse with European ports
than Port Said can offer, its immediate vicinity to the now

desert has entombed in sand. The passage of the canal
offers no special interest. The number of kilometres
