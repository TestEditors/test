ALEXANDRIA. 23



Besides numerous Dalmatians, holding places in the
great banking houses, it was remarkable how many Austrians
there were from all parts of the monarchy; but by far the
larger portion of the colony consisted of those who were
not Austrian by birth-Levantines of all sorts, who for the
sake of security in trade, and above all, thanks to the
reputation and conspicuous activity of our Austrian Lloyd,
which is far too little valued at home, had placed themselves
under the protection of our nationality.

After we had conversed for some time with these various
individuals, some of whom were our countrymen by birth,
and others only in name, they all left the Miramar, and we
retired to our cabins to change our uniform for civilian
attire. Soon after the whole party were rowed to the
harbour steps. Baron Schaffer was there to meet us, and
with him we entered the carriages which were waiting.

A crowd of porters called "hammhl" and also "scheyyal," a class of the poorest Arabs, tightly girt in blue shirts.
with sinewy brown legs and bare arms; custom-house
officers in European uniform, Turkish sailors, dock labourers,
many of them of most striking appearance, surrounded us
gaping at us inquisitively.

The Khedive was so good as even here to place some
of his carriages at our disposal. The carriages and horses
were English, the servants without exception French, in
modern European livery, the fez the only token of the East.

Outriders, or rather runners, were not wanting-those
swift-footed, lank fellows, in fantastic dress, with flowing
white sleeves, wielding long staves. They always ran
before the carriages, vociferating unceasingly.
