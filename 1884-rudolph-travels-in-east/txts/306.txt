186 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



stretch. We arrived there at noon. An avenue leads
from the landing-place into Siut; it is the most important
and considerable town above Cairo, is the seat of a Mudir,
and has a considerable trade and superior buildiiigs. It
is true the houses are even here built of clay, but they
are higher, and decorated with better Arabian ornaments,
than the other more southerly towns of the Nile. The
minarets and the handsome gates of the town at once
strike the traveller; shady sycamore avenues and fruitful
gardens surround the town in the direction of the river.

We rode through some narrow streets, and between the
stalls along the whole length of the very noticeable bazaar,
which the caravan route from Darfur, which terminates
here, keeps richly supplied with ostrich feathers and ivory.
The red and black pottery of Siut are also a specialty.
The stir and activity which prevailed in this bazaar
interested me much. The inhabitants of the Valley of the
Nile, from all the provinces of Egypt, in their gay and
varied costumes, were side by side with the genuine
commercial fellaheen.

We crossed the town, and from the opposite side, passing
along a dyke and over the well-known Canal of Joseph,
reached the foot of the steep mountains. At Siut the
mountains come nearer to the river, and the broad plain of
cultivated land above and below is narrowed for a short
space. We climbed straight up a steep and narrow path
to look at the caves and sepulchral chapels which stand
half-way up the mountain among the rocks and rubble.

This place had a certain importance in ancient times.
