140 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



The green land on this side now narrows apace, and offers
to sight a luxuriant but sorely neglected soil. Towns
are altogether wanting, and villages but very rare.

Great flights (if storks passed northwards over the
Nile valley. Birds of prey soar aloft or settle on the
rocks, and the water-fowl of the river people the occasional sand-banks. In the afternoon the fine rocky defile
of Gebel-Selseleh, with the sandstone mountains converging
from either side, delights the traveller who gazes from the
deck of his ship on this picturesque though stern and
gloomy land.

In the evening, at sunset, we reached the northern
point of a large richly cultivated island. Taking the
eastern arm of the river, we soon saw the small but
charmingly placed temple of Kum Ombu.. This monument of antiquity is enthroned on the high, steep banks
of the river, their declivity clothed with vegetation.
The desolate temple is visible from afar, without town
or human habitation in the neighbourhood, wedged in
between the river and the desert. The desert here
advances in the form of a high plateau to the edge of
the bushes on the bank. Mountains worthy of the name
there are none.

As night was drawing on we lay to below the temple;
beside us was a dahabiya occupied by Europeans. The
dragoman of this party, the experienced Dalmatian
sportsman Paulowich, came on board, and advised us
after dinner to take a bleating kid into the temple, and
there, hiding ourselves well, to watch for wolves.

No sooner said than done. At nine o'clock Hoyos
