BUBASTIS. 241



Pilabes), a famous town, especially in the Middle Ages,
which was the residence of the Arabian governors of the
eastern division of the Delta.. Then comes Zagazig, a
large place, known for its commercial activity, where
many Europeans and Levantines have settled; near it is a
mighty hill of ruins called Tel-Basta, beneath which have
lain for centuries the last remains of the temples and houses
of the town of Bubastis, so celebrated in antiquity (old
Egyptian Pi-bast, f.e. house or abode of the goddess "Bast,"
in Hebrew Phi-beseth). Here the goddess above named
was worshipped in a vast and splendid temple. Her images
in stone and bronze are still dug in quantities out of the
ruins. She is represented as a slender and young woman,
who bears a sistrum in one hand and a basket in the other,
and instead of a woman's head she has that of a cat,
cats being consecrated to her. In the inscriptions she is
often described as the local form of the peace and health
bringing goddess Isis.

Eastward from the town of Bubastis (which was the
capital of the province called after it, Bubastites) lay in
ancient times the southern half of the adjoining province of
Arabia, of which we possess but few records in the classical
writers of antiquity. It is the land to which the name of
Goshen is given in Holy Scripture.

The railway crosses this territory in a straight line to
the east, and follows the Sweet-water Canal into Wadi
Ttimilat. At the entrance to this last, at TelI-abu-Soliman,
are the ruins of the town of Pithom or Patumos, at which
the Israelites before the exodus were compelled to labour.
