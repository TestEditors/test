1-18 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.

evening on the steamer, passed the night there. At
daybreak on the 2nd of March we continued our voyage,
and spent the forenoon on deck, watching the beautiful
but not very varied landscape. Green fields, groves of
dom and date palms, some small towns, and the mountains

herons, and geese were seen; and my huntsman maintained confidently that he had seen a crocodile.

At noon we reached Keneh, a tolerably sized town of
houses built of clay, and adorned with a high minaret.

bank of the Libyan coast. Here we mounted on donkeys,
and riding past a graceful palm grove beside a very poor
looking village, in whose gardens the disgusting carrion
vultures were sitting on the dung-heaps, as though they
were domestic fowls, soon reached the well-tilled plain.

The Nile here makes a bend and approaches very near
the Libyan mountains. The border of cultivation is consequently very narrow, and after half an hour's ride we
reached the great and famous temple of Dendera. Like
the ruins of Abydus, it lies close to the margin of the tilled
land, but is itself on desert sand.

on the western bank of the Nile, opposite to the town of
Keneh, Le. Crenepolis = new town, of the Greek geographers, which finds its full equivalent in the ancient name
