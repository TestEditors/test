53 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



stream past Babylon (near Old Cairo) towards the north,
he soon saw in the distance a number of obelisks, which
mark the approach to the City of the Sun, far famed both
for its age and its history. Placed on the very edge of
the desert, whose orange sands mingle with the dark mould
of the fields, a sanctuary was reared to the god of Light,
Ra, whose existence the oldest inscriptions in the pyramid
tombs proclaim.

"To him, as well as to the neighbouring town, the
records of all ages give the most ancient and popular
name of Annu. It is the On of the Bible, in which that
priest Potiphera dwelt, whose daughter Asnath was given
to his minister Joseph to wife by the Pharaoh of that day.
Besides the name we have mentioned, the temple and the
town belonging to it bear a second, I Pi-ra,' i.e. the' City of
the Sun-god, Ra,' from which has arisen the Greek name of
Heliopolis. The first laying out of the sanctuary and of
the place is attributed, with great probability, to Arabian
immigrants, who came from the East into the Delta, and
settled on the site of the later city of Heliopolis.

"Worshippers of the sun and stars, the new-comers instituted on this spot a cultus, whose leading idea pervaded
Egyptian mythology, and formed a distinct body of
doctrine, which, even in the later periods of Egyptian
history, when Greek philosophers, such as Plato and
Eudoxus, visited the town, was imparted in the priests'
schools as the principal secret of their teaching. The
above-named philosophers succeeded with difficulty in inducing the learned priests of Heliopolis to impart to them
some of the most important dogmas of astronomical import.
