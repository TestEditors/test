74 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



its desert tribes, comes far behind Morocco on the one
hand, and Asia on the other-for Asia also in its south..
western part is inhabited by Semitic Arabs. Towards
midday tillage reappeared, a verdant moist spot in the
midst of the yellow sands. This was the great oasis of
El-Fayum; downright good land, well cultivated, circular
in shape, and surrounded on all sides by desert. The great
lake of Birket-el-Karun forms the western boundary and
division of the cultivated land from the desert. We passed
through a small portion of this well-tended bountiful oasis,
which was planted with sugar-cane, and reached the station
of Abuskar. We had come to the extreme point of the
railway. A ruinous station, not unsuited to the interior of
Africa, and some buildings belonging to it, form, together
with the sugar-factory, a small settlement.

Let no one suppose that a sugar-factory means an
establishment on a European scale, such as we find in
Bohemia; it is merely a very simple and somewhat neglected building in which the produce of the large sugar-cane
fieliis is turned to account. Some low chimneys justify the
appellation of factory.

We breakfasted quickly in the more than primitive
waiting-room of the station, and then hastened to put our
caravan in order. This is no easy task in the East, for
every one presses his services, his horse, his ass, with the
utmost vehemence; one pushes the other aside, and all yell
and gesticulate, till at last the poor deafened stranger
throws himself into the arms of the first comer. With the
help of some soldiers, and thanks to the solidity of our
sticks, chaos was soon reduced to order.
