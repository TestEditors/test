264 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



During our transit the sea was like glass, and we
reached without hindrance the stairs of the little harbour
of Jaffa, which is only adapted for small craft.

Here a new country met us, wholly diverse, more
genuinely Eastern, and richer in colour than Egypt.
Everything was novel to me. The pure Asiatic East
was before me for the first time. The town is built
in terraces up a hill. The lower houses, like the rocks
which project between them, are washed by the sea waves.
The Arab quarters built of clay have vanished; the
crumbling wood carving of the cities of the Nile, the
brown earth-coloured walls, the flat roofs-all these we
have left behind in Africa. The stone structures of the
rich -Asiatic East, much mixed with simple Hebrew
reminiscences of the Holy Land, present themselves to
us in the form of solid buildings with round cupolas in
the roofs, flat terraces, gloomy arched gateways, all built
in grey square stones without mortar or plaster.

The first step on the soil of the Holy Land recalls
in the towns the memories of the orderly rule of the
Jewish kingdom, of the wise King Solomon, or of the
days when Jesus sat in the midst of His apostles teaching
on the stone steps of the open square; and in the
country images pass before the mind's eye which played
around us while we read the Scriptures in childhood.
The patriarch Abraham, the nomad king, rich in flocks,
handsome horses, fine tents, and fair women, the wise
and learned old man, the sage of mystic speech yet full
of practical wisdom, the father of a noble race, could
have existed only in the East, dwelt only in this land.
