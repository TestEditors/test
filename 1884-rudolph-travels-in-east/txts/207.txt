THE CHAMPSIN. t." .t



distant view of the Nile and the green cultivated land
on the one side, and on the other of the vast desert and
the towering mountains beyond. It was a solemn picture-the grey ruins, the desolate desert, the lonely mountains,"
nothing green, not even a ray of sunlight to gladden
the eye.. t
The brightness of the sky and the glory of colouring
were absent on that afternoon. Everything lay in grey
shadows, and the sky was darkened, not with clouds-.
for these are unknown in Upper Egypt-but with heavy
exhalations and masses of dust, which, combined with the
oppressive languor of the air, are the first indications
of the approaching champsin, the dreaded storm of the
desert.

We returned in the evening to our ship, hunting as we
went along, and passed the night on board at the same
station. Early in the morning the steamer proceeded.
A heavy champsin storm was raging in the valley,"
the sand-clouds of the Sahara shrouding the mountains
like mist.

The sun apheared as a red disc-its beams were
unable to pierce the floods of dust. Everything was
covered with sand, which penetrated even into the closed
cabins of our steamer, and was a horrible nuisance.
A depressing heavy air pervaded the otherwise so beautiful
scene, and we contemplated with astonishment this, for us,
novel aspect of nature.

Pelicans, sundry water-fowl, and some cumbrous watereagles were fired at vainly from a great distance. We
passed some towns, among them those of Kuft and Kus.
