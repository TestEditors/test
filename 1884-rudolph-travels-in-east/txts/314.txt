192 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



We breakfasted in the small house near the Apis tombs
which had been built for purposes of study by the famous
Egyptologist, Mariette, lately deceased; and then went to
the curious low-terraced Pyramid to hunt jackals. The
Arabs had scarcely begun to climb the stones when down
came a jackal in full flight and was shot by me. After this
little sporting interlude we visited the other Pyramids in
the neighbourhood, and the small recently opened one of
King Pepi I.

Permit me here to quote some notes about Pyramids in
general, those of Memphis and Ghizeh, and also about the
Sphinx, for which I am indebted to my friend Brugsch.

"The old national god of Memphis, Ptah, in his special
capacity of king of the dead and protector of the departed,
bore the name of Sokar. In this capacity he was absolutely identical with the god Osiris of the whole country.
A sanctuary dedicated to him on the site of the present
village of Sakkara bore the old Egyptian designation
'house of Sokar,' from which the Arabic name of the
village Sakkara is directly derived. The graves of the
Memphites, which are grouped round the Pyramids in
regular order, and the oldest of which belong to the
period of the Memphite kings, were under the protection
of this king of the dead. A whole city of the dead arose
on the soil of the desert. Long rows of funeral chapels
built in stone, the so-called'houses of eternity,' formed
by their continuity the streets of the city. Underneath
them, in deep shafts, were the actual chambers in which the
departed rested in their wooden or stone coffins The bestpreserved mausoleum of the times of the Memphite kings
