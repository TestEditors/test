32 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



plough, and half-naked brown fellaheen are busy at the
water-wheels. Women, in scanty blue skirts, leading naked
children, step beside the proud caravans of camels. Bedouin families on their passage across the cultivated land,
from one desert to another, on foot and on horse, the women
on camels-a diminutive people, but proud and independent.
Pure Arabs, white burnous, fine horses, long guns, scimitars,
turbans, and simple fellaheen caps; long-haired goats
and wolf-like dogs; tawny half-starved donkeys of the
peasant, beside the well-fed white or black riding'asses of
the rich; a cavalcade of well-to-do people, the men in garish
garments on horseback, the women on camels in painted
tower-like erections, which screen them from the eyes of
the unworthy. The fields swarm with white gulls, which
follow the ploughman, and nimble peewits. Among the
bushes on the banks the red palm doves coo, and the longbilled fishing gulls mew--most genuine Egyptian creatures.
At the sight of the train, a wolf scuds across the fields,
and kites in number, falcons, and vultures hover over the
villages.

A varied, animated, and interesting display of human
activity and of animal life, veiled in the grey blue mists of
the midday heat-thus old Egypt meets the traveller's view.

Damanhthr, a genuine little Arab town, is left far behind;
and, constantly on the watch and drinking in each new
impression, we traverse the plain. We reach the Nile.
The train rattles across the iron bridge, and for the first
time we greet the dark majestic flow of this oldest of
historic rivers. On the right bank we run through the
station of Kaffr-ez-Zayat, a small town lying hard by.
