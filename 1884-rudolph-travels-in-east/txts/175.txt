OUR .SHOW OF GAME. 103



We stopped a passing engine and got into the empty
luggage van attached to it. In this way we reached
Abuskar very quickly. Our Arabs rode full swing after us
between the rails, and followed with incredible celerity.

As we had some spare time, we resolved that we would

beside one of the guns who was standing at the corner.
He could not fire while the wolf was near him, on account
of the country people, and when he discharged both barrels,
the wolf was already too far off.

A few seconds later, another gentleman shot an exceedingly fine wolf, the biggest of all which we had hitherto
killed, at the moment when he was going to double at the
road that crossed the field. Before the heaters came out,
two other guns got each of them a wolf, and a woodcock.

gave us a better yield than at our first hunt. At the
station, the show of six wolves shot in one day was made,
and, had we captured all that were wounded, our results
would have been quite extraordinary.

On the whole, we had every reason to be satisfied with
the success of our four and a half days' hunting excursion
in the oasis of Fayum.
