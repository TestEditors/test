OUT IN THE DESERT. 65



in a moment a jackal came full gallop past under the
wall. A successful shot brought him down. I rescued
my booty with difficulty from the assaults of the excited
dogs which had followed the track closely.

It was a specimen of the true African jackal--a reddishyellow, thin, long-legged beast with pointed ears. Amongst
my comrades, Hoyos had been so fortunate as to secure
a pretty large she-wolf of the African species, Canis
Lupaster.

When we had had the garden beaten a second time
with the help of some natives, a second wolf appeared. I
heard it rustling in the bushes, and my huntsman even saw
it, but unluckily the crafty beast escaped unharmed over the
wall. Two wood-snipe were also seen, but not within shot.
Cranes soared aloft, and birds of various kinds abounded in
the leafy orange-trees.

After short but very successful sport, we left the garden
and set out for home. The sun had set, the shadows grew
deeper, and twilight came on.

The road, dangerous enough by day on the top of the
high narrow dyke, was little suited for the night, and so we
resolved to leave the canal which crosses the cultivated
land, and to drive straight across the desert. At first all
went well, but the strength of the horses soon gave way,
and shower and slower they dragged the heavy carriages
through the deep sand. It would have taken us several
hours to reach Cairo in this fashion, and so, with the help of
some torch-bearers, we made our way back to the arable
land.

We passed the garden of the Kub castle. Pats flitted
