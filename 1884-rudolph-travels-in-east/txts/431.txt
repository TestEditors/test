THE CHURCH OF THE SEPULCHRE. 285



They are both obliged to hoist their supplies of meat and
drink in baskets through the windows. N ear the quarters
of these ecclesiastical guards galleries lead round inside the
church, from which the clergy on patrol can overlook the
whole interior.

We descended from the convent into the church, and
examined the various shrines and historical points, as well
as all the side chapels and places with which legends or
dogmas are connected. One gathers a rich store of interesting recollections and ideas there. It is easy to see that
the different buildings date from very different epochs, and
many characteristic reminiscences of the Middle Ages are
to be met with. Individual chapels and shrines-of which
there are a great number-vary in type according to their
owners. Some are quite Latin; others Armenian, Syrian,
or Coptic. By far the most numerous are the orthodox
Greek, brilliant with gold and silver, and overladen with
dark Byzantine pictures of saints.

To describe the Church of the Sepulchre in all its
detail would be a long task needing preparatory study.
Moreover, fairly minute and accurate descriptions are to be
found by those who need them in many of the hand-books.
I limit myself, therefore, to recording impressions and
scenes stamped vividly on my memory.

Upstairs and downstairs, often over the most irregular
pavement, we roamed round the whole church-not a
corner was there which I did not visit. Everywhere, but
especially at the Greek shrines, we saw numbers of Russian
pilgrims crossing themselves perpetually between their
prostrations.
