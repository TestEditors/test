108 TRA VELS IN THE EAST.



distribute the life-giving water, which they draw with a big
spoon-shaped implement from the channels, distinguishing
features of the Nile.

We glide along past towns and villages. Light-green
palms, soaring minarets, and broad towered dove-cotes are
the features of the clay-built, earth-coloured villages, whose
ruinous disorder has an unmistakably picturesque character.
Innumerable kites hover about the human habitations; the
yelp of dogs, the bellowing of buffaloes, donkeys, and
camels, the screams of Arabs and the wailing sound of the
water-wheels, dust, dirt, and disorder, are the customary
accessories.

Great vultures stand on the long sand-banks, and white
carrion vultures beside carcases which have floated to
the surface. Flights of cranes, storks, spoonbills, grey
herons, pelicans, and Nile geese, together with numerous
kinds of ducks, give movement to the scene. On the
broken ground of the banks the spurred-peewit, waterwagtails, grey-fishers, swallows, and an army of small sandbirds disport themselves. The Europeans fire from every
steamer and every dahabiya on all the water-fowl which
are here in their winter quarters. No very productive
sport can therefore be expected by shooting from the deck,
for at the sight of a vessel in the far distance the frightened
birds take flight.

We came past the township of Abu Tig, where the
mountains recede and leave space for a well-cultivated
plain; but immediately after the lofty Gebel-Sh√©ch-Hai1de,
pierced with ancient quarries and pits, advances to the very

edge of the stream.
