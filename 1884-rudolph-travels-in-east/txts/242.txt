I44 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



higher houses, and a bazaar which is worth seeing. The
other quarters of the town consist of miserable earth huts
and irregular nooks of all kinds. The eastern side is
surrounded by a wall, which has fallen down at several
points; to that adjoins a large tract of Mussulman buryinggrounds. Our first visit was to the bazaar. A long
street is closely filled on both sides with stalls and
covered oxierhead with boards because of the sun.

The dealers in the shops are Arabs,'in their long
Oriental dresses, with turbans on their heads. The
people who move to and fro and bring their goods
to market, cheated and deceived by the cunning Semite,
are no Orientals, nor even the fellaheen, who are allied to
them. The Bedouin, too, is wholly absent. The people
are of purely African race; many negroes, dark-brown
Nubians, the successors of the old Ethiopians, Ababdehs,
and Beshas, and all the various small tribes of Kushite
origin wander up and down.

We have reached the extreme limit of the East; here
it only exists and thrives in the form of a commercial
town, for the transmission of African produce down
the Nile.

Genuine Eastern products, such as we saw in the Muski
at Cairo, are not to be found here. The raw produce of
the tropics lies piled up in the narrow shops.

White and grey ostrich feathers; antlers and skins of
many kinds of antelopes and gazelles; covers made of
skins of panthers and other beasts of prey; eggs, the
fruits of tropical plants, gums, spices, African arms, sticks
for cahlel-drivers, primitive ornaments such as the negroes
