and in fact impenetrable, bushes, trees, decaying trunks,
mould and ruins of all kinds-a primeval forest in a
narrow space. In the broadest part the distance from one
bank to another does not exceed two hundred paces.

Some of the guns were now to go to the right, others to

with their dogs were to keep on the same level and beat
the bushes and rocks in line. Salim remained beside me
and directed the whole of the chase.
