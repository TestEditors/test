Io TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



disgust, that everything was in motion around me. Tables,
chairs, bed, everything was dancing. The ship rolled and
shook perceptibly and creaked wofuliy under the pressure of
the waves.

Hastening on deck .I had a fine sight of the heavy
storm; the waves rose mountaihs high, broke over each
other and scattered in crystal foam. A storm at sea is
perhaps the grandest sight that nature affords, especially
when fine effects of light, shade, and cloud contribute their
share to the general impression. The heavens were on
this occasion covered with heavy clouds, and only here and
there a ray of sunlight broke through.

We were off Cephalonia. The grand mountains of this
island overtopped the mist. In their centre was the loftiest
and most beautiful of them, the snow-capped Monte N ero,
the ancient Ainos. Stern and gloomy were the cliffs, grey
and unfriendly the shadows, and we feared that the
weather would grow still worse.

Our brave ship fought her way but slowly against the
waves, and it was midday ere, passing along the west
side of the hilly, picturesque island of Zante, we reached its
southern point.

The storm increased, and instead of getting more sea
room, we fell off from our course, and the captain resolved
to run into the sheltered canal of Zante. We came slowly
round the south point and turned into the channel which
lies between the island and the opposite mainland. As
soon as Zante sheltered us from the westerly gale, sea
and air grew still, and after her hard fight the Miranutr
glided towards the town.
