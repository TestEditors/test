334 TRA VELS IN THE EAST.



The pelicans came suddenly along from the Dead
Sea, crowded round the fire for a few minutes, saluted by
fruitless shots, and then departed, flying heavily up the
valley northwards. As time was short, I left this spot and
galloped without intermission along splendid ground over
sandy stretches and grassy heath, between the thick
shrubs, little groups of small low trees-one might almost
have called them miniature forests-and across some
mountain streams with broken banks, big stones, and
abundant growth of plants, hastening to the Jordan, until
we came to the village of Jericho.

The Jericho of the present day consists of some wretched
huts inhabited by iniserable people, perishing from the
climate, and in ill repute because of their marked propensity to theft. Hedges protected by thick, long thorns
surround the village. A tower rises as the last remains
of the days of the Frankish kingdom, and beside it is said
to be the spot where the house of Zacchaeus stood. An
aged sycamore is shown as the tree from which the pious
man beheld the Redeemer. Miserable and decayed is this
place, where a flourishing city stood in ancient times and
even down to the days of the Crusaders.

We rode past the outside huts, and came through fields
of wild oats and flowering shrubs and a vegetation resembling that of a garden, to the foot of the western hills.
Our immediate goal, the fine and famous Well of the Sultan
(Ain-es-Sultan), lay before us. At this point the expedition into the Valley of the Jordan proper was to commence.
