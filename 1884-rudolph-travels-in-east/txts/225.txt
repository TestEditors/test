AN ANCIENT INSCRIPTION. 133



"The divine benefactor created by Ra (the sun) is

of whose path is Amon. If he is on an expedition forthwith man's strength takes possession of his body, and he
is like to the God Chim (Pan) in time of terror, and

Semites to his adversaries, and the nine peoples of the same,
but all the peoples and the countries became his servants.

"They that hated the king have become subject to his
magic powers, yea to the very last of them. His hands

extol him and acknowledge him as a sun in the heavens.

"His glance is terrible in the day of battle. No
