quickly led a sheep to the spot, stabbed it, disembowelled
it as a first dainty morsel for the vultures, and hastened
back to my companions at the temple.

After we had thoroughly examined all the monuments,
we eat the breakfast we had brought with us in one of
the ancient halls. Our meal was scarcely finished before
Hoyos and I were again under way to pay a visit to
the dead sheep. We had not quite come within firing
distance when a very cautious vulture perceived our
approach, and with a rushing flap of his wings, rose
from the ground. At least twenty of his unwieldly
comrades followed him. Hoyos was so fortunate as to
bring down a large white-headed vulture from among
the mass. I was less skilful, and only hit a very large
specimen, which, badly wounded, flew low across the plain.
The ravenous creatures had severely handled the poor
sheep; only his fleece and some mutilated morsels
remained.

After this hunting intermezzo was over, we returned
to the other gentlemen, and went with them towards
the village, where we paid a visit to a blind peasant.
This worthy man is one of the wealthiest householders
of the place, and carries on besides a traffic in Egyptian
antiquities, which he, in defiance of law, has dug up
in and around the temples. Under Brugsch Pasha's
directions we bought some of the better things, and had
at the same time the opportunity of noticing the very
primitive, not to say dirty, arrangements of the abode
of a denizen of the Valley of the Nile.
