STRUGGLE WITH AN ICHNEUMON, 97



wood by the shore in a northerly direction. Marching
through the burning sand of the desert, which reflected the
most intense heat, was anything but agreeable. Once more
we surrounded the shrubs at fixed intervals, and soon a
merry hunt began. This time, however, the baited game
did not show itself so readily, and the chase went backwards and forwards several times. After standing at bay
for a short time, an ichneumon appeared in front of the
Grand Duke, who rolled the absurd creature over, it is
true, but it dragged itself back into the bush, where a
violent battle at once began with the dogs, who" were on
its track. One large long-legged dachshund and the
ichneumon had got such tight hold of each other, that one
might have lifted them together. It was with the greatest
difficulty that the combatants were separated, and in doing
so one gentleman was bitten in the hand by the dog, and
another by the ichneumon.

Numerous cormorants and herons had passed by me"
along the shore while they were beating, but I had not fired
on account of the larger.prey. As it was afternoon, we resolved to set out on our long row back to the opposite side,
and to take the most direct line. We rowed across in
several boats. The air had become cooler, and we could
enjoy the distant view over the lake and desert more
than we had done earlier in the day.

Our boat people were in high spirits, and amidst incessant yells and inarticulate wild howls they pulled all
their clothes off, and, stark naked, raced the boats one
against the other. This game had a practical advantage
for us, for we got on all the quicker.
