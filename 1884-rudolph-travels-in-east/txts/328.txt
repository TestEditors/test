THERE-TO PORT SAID.

WE drove from the station through the beautiful avenue of

trees, across the great Nile bridge, into the ancient City

of the Caliphs, whose streets at this hour, late in the
afternoon, were full of life.

Carriages and horsemen, swift-footed runners, Western
bustle and activity by the side of caravans of camels,
veiled fellaheen women, braying asses, water-carriers, and
blind beggars-all this glides rapidly past, and glad were
we again to enjoy the life of Cairo. Through the European
quarter and over the canal bridge, we soon reached the
Shubra Avenue and our own' Kasr-en-Nusha.

After a bath and dinner the magic of African moonlight tempted some of us out, and we drove in hired
carriages into the town.

We stopped at the Esbekiy√© Garden, and went through
the balmy plantations, by the pond, and round amongst the
artificial waterfalls, rocks, and kiosks. People were sitting
at most of the restaurants-chiefly Levantines belonging to
the commercial classes-young men passing the time in
drinking, listening to music, or playing at cards.
