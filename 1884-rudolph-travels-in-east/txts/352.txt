222 TRAVELS [ N THE EAST.



After a passage of many hours we reached the salt lake
of Ismailia and the town of that name-a wholly European
place. The yellowish-white deserts which surround the
lake, too, are mostly quite level. Far off to the south you
see the fine range of the Ataka mountains. The region
is undoubtedly stern and monotonous; but the dark blue
of the salt water of the lake is in striking contrast to the
light-hued desert shore, and the whole makes a remarkable
combination of colour.

On the short drive to the station we had occasion to
admire the wealth, industry, and good taste of the French.
They have succeeded in evoking from the desert a charming little sea-bathing place, with clean white houses, with
green jalousies, good roads, shady avenues, and well-caredfor gardens. When our train started we passed some
small marshes, then traversed the desert, which is here
completely Arab. Further on lay a small lake with reeds
about it, and a few wretched cabins were in its neighbourhood. When the desert hills near the line were low
enough to admit of a distant view, we saw to the south the
lofty Ataka, and further on the mountains of Ammon.
This chain is the same whose western spur is formed by
the familiar Gebel Mokattam.

After a time the desert seemed to retire, and at last
disappeared from sight, and we were once more in the rich
cultivated land of Lower Egypt. We passed the town of
Zagazig and several smaller places. Soon the lovely City
of the Caliphs came into view, golden in the beams of the
setting sun. We took the shortest road from the station to
Kasr-eu-Nusha, where we devoted the evening to repose.
