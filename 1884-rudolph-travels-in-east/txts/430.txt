284 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



to the small Franciscan convent, which also pertains to the
buildings of the Church of the Sepulchre. By narrow
stairs and dirty rooms, with horrible close air, we came to
a modest cell called the refectory. Here the friendly
monks entertained us with very good chocolate.

During breakfast the custode of Terra Santa described
the contests and enmities which more or less unremittingly
prevail between the different creeds, and which sometimes
proceed from words to deeds. These, if they arise within
the church, are adjusted in energetic fashion by mis..
believing Turkish soldiers. The sturdy monk spoke
valorously, and in vigorous terms cast the whole blame on
the Eastern Christians. It is difficult to decide on whom
the heaviest blame should devolve, but it is certain that
these constant altercations do not lend a halo to Christianity
in the eyes of the Turks.

After breakfast we went over the whole convent. The
monks live in wretched cells; a terrace on the roof is the
only place where they can breathe fresh air. This small
Franciscan convent and the dwellings on the opposite
side of the church for Greek and Armenian priests are
all within the precincts of the Church of the Sepulchre,
which has only one gate, and this only opened by the
Turks, who exercise supreme control over it, on the occasion of great festivals or the arrival of many pilgrims, at
the request of one or of all the patriarchs. In the intervals,
often for weeks and months, the church remains closed, and
a combined guard resides within it and keeps jealous watch.
No gate is allowed into the city, either from the poo; Latin
convent or from the quarters'of the Greek Christians.
