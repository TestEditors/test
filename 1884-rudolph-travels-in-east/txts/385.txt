"THE BRIDGE or TREASURE." 249



marked along it from Port Said to Suez suit the character
of the desert which is traversed by its blue waters. The
only spot which claims notice is that known by the ancient
name Kantara-el-Chazne, i.e. the, Bridge of Treasures, in
the north of the Datte ] Lake. It marks the passage of
Egyptian caravans into Asia.

"In the earliest times of Egyptian history a strong fortress stood on this spot lying on both sides of the canal which
united the Dattel Lake with Lake Menzaleh. A bridge
led from one side to the other, as a picture of the time of
King Seti I. (father of Ramses 11., Sesostris) on the outer
north wall of the great temple of Amon at Karnak distinctly
shows. At this point began that eastward region to
which the Egyptians gave the name of Hazian.or Hazion.
The Greeks transformed the name into Casion, and the
Romans to Casium, by which they designated the mountainous part of the desert near the ancient Lake Serbonis
(now only a marsh), which advances as a promontory into
the Mediterranean. A sacred shrine stood here, dedicated
to the guardian of the district, Zeus Cassius. The Arabs
on their part give to this old name of Hasion an inventive
involution, i.e. Chazne,'treassure,' which has kept its place
in the above-mentioned names, Kantara-el-Chazne, or the
' bridge of treasure.' Lastly, we must observe that the old
' way of the Philistines,' as it is called in the Scriptures, by
which the armies of the Pharaohs and of foreign conquerors
advanced from Kantara to Palestine, lay between the Mediterranean and Lake Serbonis, while in later and recent

times the preference was given to the south of the lake
for the desert or caravan highway."
