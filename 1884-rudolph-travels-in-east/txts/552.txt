368 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



the verdure of the bottom of the vale gave promise of sport
such as we had in our last days in the Valley of the Jordan
with Salim. We discovered, however, after many fruitless
attempts, that neither the Bedouins nor their dogs would
penetrate into the thick underwood, so we undertook a long
expedition across the steppe to a morass described by the
sheik as excellent for our purpose. In the grass of the
steppe we first put up some quail and then a flock of
plover. The nearer we came to the morass, which could be
seen a long way off, the thicker grew. the bushes; from
among them sprang out two remarkable little creatures--smaller than deer, of yellowish colour, with horns like a roe,
and with the springing movements and long brush of the
fallow-deer. They were unfortunately too far off to allow
us to have a fair shot at them. The edges of the morass
were covered with marshy spots and the tall moist green
sword-grass. We shot on this wet ground some beautifully
coloured frankolin cocks and one female bird in its sober
suit of brown, not unlike that of the hen pheasant.

The Grand Duke was now despatched to the further
side of this forest of pale yellow reeds, while the Bedouins
and I endeavoured from our side to penetrate its interior.
Reeds and sedge of more than man's height met over our
heads, and we waded knee-deep in marsh and mire and in
the decaying matter of the plants. After long walking over
this loathsome ground, which swarmed with toads, I reached
a clearing where, standing in the water, I was, at the bidding
of the Bedouins, to await the further course of the chase.
Myriads of disgusting marsh insects:, buzzed around me, and
it was in truth a spot so unpleasant as not to be easily
