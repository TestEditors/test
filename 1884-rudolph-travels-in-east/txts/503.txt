AT the limits of vegetation, where, along a sharply defined
line, thick shrubs give place to stony mountains, a fountain
bubbles forth from the ground in plenteous fulness and
flows into an ancient stone basin. Wherever springs
rise from the earth or brooks descending from the mountains bring blessing, there is verdure in wood, bush, and
field. These favoured strips extend along the currents
of water from the foot of the bare mountain to the Jordan
with its broad meadows. Alongside this blooming line
a rib of genuine steppe runs up to the next rivulet. The
plain of the Jordan is traversed lengthwise by the sacred
river with its green bands; crosswise it is divided into
alternating bands of steppe and of fertile though wild
garden landscape. The most beautiful of all these oases
is that which, beginning at the fountain of the Sultan,
descends as a broad band to the Jordan along the banks
of the rivulet. Our camp had been pitched beside the
spring at the foot of the mountains and the edge of the
verdure. From henceforth our journey was from spring
to spring, for to these the caravan which traverses these
wild regions must closely adhere.
