100 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



forsaken, and for a promised backsheesh the mixed multitude followed us. From afar we espied a not very large
field of sugar-cane, which was still standing though the
harvest had already begun. We made for it with all speed,
stimulated by hope.

Discussing the hunt we were about to begin. we marched
along the dyke of a broad but dry canal.

When we had reached the spot, the guns were first
placed. The Grand Duke remained at the corner beside
the canal; Hoyos and I stood at the side where the field
came down to the foot of the canal dyke; the other
gentlemen surrounded all the sides of the cane plantation.
Unluckily, the guns were too few, and the spaces between
the individual sportsmen too considerable. Close to our
posts, buffaloes and camels were grazing, and unquestionably
the ensevWe had not the look of a wolf-hunt according to
European ideas.

The black drivers had hardly entered the canes, with
infernal yells, when my neighbour fired right into the field;
thereupon an enormous wolf leaped out between him and
me, and away with long springs over the canal. Though
the distance was a considerable one, I rad up on the dyke
and discharged my two barrels after the flying beast, whereupon it took its way crosswise through the fields with its
right hind quarter wounded..

The heaters soon appeared. Among the yellow cane
the brown fellaheen looked most extraordinary, and even
more so did the Moors, of whom'there were a considerable
number; each one came along gnawing the stalk of a
sugar-cane. We had the field beaten a second time.
