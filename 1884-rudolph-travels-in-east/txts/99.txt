THE BAZAARS. 49



CMn-Chalil-in a quarter of its own, with covered shops
and existing from the days of the Mameluke Sultan elAschraf Salaheddin Chalil.

Here you find the varied movement of Eastern life, the
most genuine articles of all kinds, all Oriental; and beside
them the products of negro lands, and especially of the
Soudan..

In the carpet bazaar I went into the court of the house
of a rich merchant. The old man unrolled with the utmost
dignity his richest wares-Turkish and especially Persian
carpets of great value.

After spending many hours in the Arab part of the
town we pushed our way through the thronged and narrow
streets back to the Muski. Glorious in colour and picturesque as Eastern life may seem, especially to travellers
accustomed to the moulded monotony of Europe, yet even
this Paradise has its dark side. I place in the first rank
the innumerable insects. Millions of large black flies fill
the streets, swarming round the Oriental, who never drives
them away, but allows his face to be quite covered by them.
These creatures carry dirt and infection with them into
the eyes, and this may explain the number of persons
afflicted with blindness and with the most loathsome
diseases of the eye. Generally speaking, one may say that
one sees in the street cripples and invalids and people
afflicted with diseases and defects of body of the possibility
of which the European had no previous conception.

In the Muski we hired asses-those little skinny beasts
which with the high Arab saddle ply by thousands from
one end of Cairo to the other and take the place of cabs.
