I78 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



huntsmen had persuaded me to visit a station near MedinetHabu in the evening, in quest of beasts of prey. Followed
by my huntsman, therefore, I rode off after dinner, and once
more took the long way across the tilled land and past the
Colossus, to the wretched village of MSlinet-Habu, which
consists solely of mud-huts. A tolerably broad desert plain,
which separates the cultivated land from the foot of the
mountains, opens immediately behind this village

Some much-trodden tracks, marked by the footprints
of hyzenas, wolves, and jackals, connect the mountain with
the level sporting ground below. On such a track I hid
behind some large stones. The sun was setting; the sand
of the desert, the rocks of the mountains, the ruins, the
palms, and the villages of the plain were flooded with the
richest colours. A large yellow-brown Pharaoh-owl took
its noiseless Right from its dark hiding-place in search of
prey. Soon after a jackal appeared, keeping the beaten
track very closely.

I shot at' the beast as it trotted carelessly forward, but
unluckily it was too far off. It tumbled over, but at once
got on its feet again, and hurried back towards the mountains. I found, indeed, a red streak, but a brief search
had no further result. Time, also, was running short, as
twilight had already set in, and I had to hasten to the
proper station for the hyaenas.

Led by the Arab, I rode through the desert, which
seemed to extend further and further into the plain, till
we came to a small sand-hill. The ambush had been well
chosen, and the dead ass was a conspicuous object on the

white sand.
