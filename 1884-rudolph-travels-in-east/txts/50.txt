I6 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



bare, and rugged mountains. We passed several solitary
farmhouses and small villages.

The road was the reverse of lonely. The peasants,
some on foot, but mostly on small miserable-looking
donkeys, or on two-wheeled carts, brought their produce
to the town. I looked well at them. They seem a somewhat diminutive race, with dark skin and hair. Their
costume is neither becoming nor bright. Wide trousers,
the feet in shoes, like our Dalmatian slippers, and on the
head small caps or great broad-brimmed hats. Many
carried long single-barrelled guns.

After a two hours' drive the road approached the
mountains. The hills on the right end in a marshy
Iagune, and in the distance sparkle the blue waters of the
Adriatic.

The mountains on the left meet the coast in a vertical
wall of rock, and the road ends at a village built in steps
up the slope of the mountain side. The high mountains
which one now has close at hand are on this side perfectly
bare-steep cliffs and great masses of boulder, without any
vegetation. From the village we made our way on foot
round the base of the lofty cliff, between it and the sea.
We soon reached the northern point of the island, and had
a splendid view; Cephalonia lay to the north; directly in
front of us was the basin of a narrow valley planted with a
forest of oaks, and in the midst stood a convent half hidden
between the two hills.

We went over the convent chapel, which was richly
adorned with gilded reliquaries and the black pictures of
saints. It appeared to be a favoured resort of pilgrims.
