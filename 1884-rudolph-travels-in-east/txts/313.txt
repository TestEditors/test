APIS TOJIBS OF SAKKARA. 191




interment was arranged at great expense, and its carcase,
well embalmed and adorned with rich decorations, was
borne on a car to the place of the Apis graves."

We rode from Memphis, beyond the cultivated land, up
into the great Libyan desert, to the Pyramids of Sakkara,
and past Mariette's house to the Apis tombs.

The country here has exactly the same character as
that at the Pyramids of Ghizeh. These Pyramids can be
seen from those of Sakkara, as well as Cairo, its citadel,
and the terraced forms of the Mokattam mountains.

We penetrated, provided with torches, into the subterranean labyrinth of passages of the Apis tombs. They
seemed interminable, and the air was dry and oppressive.
"In the most brilliant period of Egyptian history, as also
later, under the foreign Ptolemean princes, the bulls were
placed in gigantic sarcophagi of the hardest stone, and
laid in separate compartments of the underground galleries.
They are placed in chronological order one after the other,
each grave having its own inscription. The Apis tombs
of Memphis, which are now made accessible to strangers
in the most convenient way, contain twenty-four of these
colossal sarcophagi. The series of bulls buried here began
with the middle of the sixteenth century B.C., and closed at
the time of the Emperor Augustus.

"The animals which lived before that period found
resting-places after death in the terraced Pyramid of Sakkara. In its interior there is a large vaulted space with
separate passages and niches. The bones of bulls which

remain in them distinctly indicate the purpose of this
Pyramid."
