366 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



Old cut stones and daris in the midst of the now
overgrown vegetation in the immediate proximity of a
wretched village, consisting of a few stone huts, bear witness
to the former but long-forgotten importance and culture of
the place. In old Biblical times the Canaanites dwelt here.
The city was taken later by David. When conquered by
the Scythians it received from the Greeks the name of
Scythopolis. In the days of the Romans it was a rich and
flourishing place, and Cleopatra had her meeting here with
Alexander Jannaeus. Pompey advanced through Baisan to
Judaea. In early Christian times the town was the seat of
a bishop and' famous as the birthplace of Basilides and
Cyrillus. Saladin conquered the town and burnt it to the
ground, and it lost for ever its greatness and power.

The last relics of an old theatre and some temples, and
of many columns of basalt buried in the bushes and marsh
grass, still remain. It is a gloomy, marshy place, damp and
unwholesome, filled with the unceasing cry of toads and
frogs. In the wretchedly filthy village, the ruined inhabitants
seemed to be starving beside their damp stone walls, and
children and dogs rolled on the sodden marshy ground.
We found our camp already pitched and in the best order
on the north side of the village. Close beside it a ravine
fell steeply down, within which a spring was running gaily
among rocks, shrubs, and sycamores with their spreading
branches. We saw here traces of Roman baths hewn in
the rock. Above our camp, to the west of the village, is
the plateau and the region of the springs.

On our arrival I went at once with a hunting Bedouin,
who was waiting for me by my tent, to the damp marsh.
