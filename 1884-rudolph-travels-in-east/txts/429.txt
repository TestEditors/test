Damascus. Our handsome camp had been pitched just
without the gate, beside some stony places and heaps of
ruin, and amongst stunted olive gardens. The horses and
beasts of burden lay close by. Our people slept on the

which were only separated from the camp by a small
valley.

Early on the morning of the 30th we all went, masters
and servants, to the hospice, where the chaplain, the clergy

Leaving the chapel, we went over the great church and
through another little chapel, belonging to the Franciscans,
