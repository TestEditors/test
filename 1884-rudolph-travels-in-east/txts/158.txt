94 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



I had a free line of fire to the shore. This point made the
natural boundary of the first beat.

On our way through the sand we had occasion to
examine many different tracks and footprints. It appears
that the beasts of prey from the desert come nightly to the
shore to drink, and probably to surprise the sleeping waterfowl.

There was track upon track; those of the hyaena, beside
that of the wolf; jackals, the fox of the desert; the lines
also which the great lizards draw, and the broad trail of
the dismal spectacle-snake, were not lacking in the fine
sand. I had hardly reached my post when the dogs, in
the distance it is true, began to hunt. The drive was
rapid, and the loud yelping approached my quarter.

Suddenly there appeared, close to the sandy shore,
a long, grey, shaggy beast, with a pointed head and a long
shapeless, slender tail, going at a quick trot. A successful
shot laid it low. An ichneumon, a thoroughly African and
very ugly animal which bears no resemblance, either in

track. The piece of bush had been beaten, and we
resolved to take a similar and adjacent piece. Our second
attempt met unfortunately with no success.

Camel tracks in the sand showed us that a tribe of
Bedouins were in the neighbourhood, and, in fact, we
soon observed that several camels were browsing in the
underwood, heard the yelping of their dogs, and saw from
afar some dark figures approach- an encampment. I have
been told that the wild tribes in these parts are very poor,
