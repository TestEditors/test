BY THE DEAD SEA. 333



clay. To our right we saw a plain which extends to the
thickly grown meadows of the Jordan, and to our left, below
a large fall of earth, a marshy depression filled with almost
impenetrable thickets of reeds and briars.

A big wild boar doubled just in front of the horsemen
by one of these thickly grown patches. The moment I
caught sight of the huge creature I jumped from my horse
and followed its track; going round the clump of bushes,
which was only a few hundred paces in circumference,
I found proof that the beast had not yet passed through.
I posted the gentlemen quickly and got the gendarmes
to drive. It soon became clear to us how hard it is to get
an animal out of an impenetrable mass of brambles, reeds,
and grass, even when that mass is but small in itself. All
our efforts were vain. We tried setting it on fire, but only
the grassy parts burnt up, sending gigantic columns of smoke
into the air. The innermost thicket, with the full sap of
spring, did not so much as crackle, and afforded a secure
hiding-place for the game. It was a pity that we failed, for
all the game from the steppes, barren mountains, and rocks
betakes itself to these splendid luxuriant thickets of the
Valley of the Jordan, which are unapproached by man, and
there it remains. The tracks which we found in the moist
clay told of the wealth of animal life in this spot. Within
a narrow space I saw the tracks of several wild boars,
hyaenas, wolves, jackals, of the Asiatic panther, the lynx,
and smaller beasts of prey which I was unable to distinguish. Two wild geese and several strand-runners flew
up from a water pool, and a flock of pelicans and one
inquisitive osprey floated in the clouds of smoke.
