SHOOTING IN THE SHUBRA GARDEN. 239



moister spots were richly peopled by Rocks of grey heron,
while on the high pines which adorn an artificially made
hill near the castle the plump aigrettes build in incredible
numbers..

We gave these different herons an unpleasant time,
and then, alas! had to leave this enchanting garden
hurriedly, just when its whispering boughs were steeped in
the golden light of the setting sun, in order to be in time for
dinner. We cast covetous glances at the shrubberies and
waving fields of corn, for I could easily guess how favourable this spot, enclosed by walls and perfectly still, must be
for beasts of prey. A few days later, Saurma, taking my
advice, went to shoot in this Shubra garden, and killed a
lynx and an ichneumon.

On reaching Kasr-en-Nusha we dined with the two
brothers Saurma. The younger brother and Prince Taxis
had only returned the day before from a long and very
fatiguing expedition to the mountains of the Red Sea,.
where they had vainly sought the Arabian ibex.

On the 24th of March the whole party drove out early
on the road to Heliopolis, to the extreme verge of the town,
where a large tent was placed on an open space decorated
with flags. There were a quantity of people present, and q
the Austro-Hungarian colony was there in full force, for we
were celebrating in festive fashion the laying of the stone
of an Austrian hospital. Catouli-Bey, a wealthy Jewish
merchant who is under Austrian protection, had, in the
most munificent way, found the whole of the money for this
good work, and was himself present in the old Hebrew

dress. The ceremony was duly performed amidst cheers
