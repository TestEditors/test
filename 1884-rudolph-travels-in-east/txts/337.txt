DAMIE TTA. 209



is thoroughly Eastern; the streets, if possible, dirtier,
narrower, and more decorated with wooden nooks and
notches than most Arab towns. Where there is no water
running past the houses, the old Dutch character disappears.

Damietta has, however, undeniably more of a northern
air (if the word be allowed in Africa) than the Arab
quarter of Cairo, or the towns of Upper Egypt. One
realizes that it might sometimes be almost cold here,
and the presence of the sea makes itself felt in dew.
The houses are more solidly built, better roofed; in a
word, arranged to be more and longer lived in. At our
worthy representative's everything was in splendid order-.
European rooms with Turkish rugs, Arab servants, and
the perfume of the East, the horrible attar of roses,
pervading the whole house. In everything it could be
seen that the owner was a genuine Levantine.

After a hasty breakfast, during which our small stock
of luggage had been placed on pack-horses, we started
anew. Some of us were mounted on asses, two of the
gentlemen got into an old-fashioned coach, the pride of the
place, and in a few minutes the little caravan was in
motion to the regulation yells of the donkey-drivers. We
went through some streets, and then reached by a good
road between gardens, country houses, small palm woods,
and along a canal, the shore of the lake. Three miserable
little fishermen's huts stood on the sandy beach. Behind
us were lofty palms, thick hedges, and blooming verdure;
before us lay the broad, boundless grey-brown lake, with
its flat dunes and marshy shores, the image of drear
monotony'and sleepy dulness.
