"TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



broken rocks-only at the northern point of the island there
is a small strip with a flat shore, and a marshy lagoon in
miniature. Between the shore and the central rock there is
a level space seldom exceeding three hundred paces, and
covered with fine sand.

On the northern side of the island this little plain is in
many places full of great stones and boulders, which have
broken from the central mass and rolled down. Except the
bushes on the shore, all is bare; even the scantiest grass
will not grow. The waters wash the crumbling shore
unceasingly, and before long the whole island will be
reduced to the imperishable rock in the centre.

After a short stay the Grand Duke and Prince Taxis
left the camp, and were quickly followed by Baron Saurma
and myself. Our plan was to start in two parties from one
point, each with some dachshunds, and to beat the mountain cone, driving one against the other till we met at the
north side.

Among the first rocks two stone plovers rose, one of
which I shot. The invaluable Osman led the dogs, which
he loosed among the stones. Now began an interesting
but most fatiguing hunt. One had to jump over smooth
rocks and rough heaps of stories to follow the dogs. The
formation of the mountain is most remarkable. You find
stones of incredible shapes, many like huge mushrooms;
beneath it is hollow, pierced in all directions with passages;
through crevices, and sometimes between wide rifts across
which you must leap, you catch sight of the dark passages
in which the dogs are hunting, and every now and again
creeping out into sight.'
