"TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



Greek places of worship, arranged in the orthodox fashion,
only, strange to say, with bell towers of the type of St.
Mark's. Here, too, the priests were noticeable for the
poverty of their dress. The day was the festival of some
Greek saint, and in the great church the faithful were kissing
the coarsely plated reliquaries.

A stroll through the town gave matter for interesting
reflection. One special fact noted was the striking resemblance of the interior of the towns in the three southern
kingdoms of Europe.

In Zante you might easily have supposed yourself in
a decayed Italian or Spanish town. Life in all of them is
carried on in the street. In front of the numerous caf√©s
the men sit with broad-brimmed hats, a plaid thrown round
their shoulders, and shabby clothes, swinging lazily on old
three-legged straw chairs. The coffee-cup stands on another
chair before them, and in their hands is a cigarette. They
gossip, they laugh, they gesticulate. Here coffee, Turkish
cigarettes, Greek placards, priests with round high hats;
there chocolate, Havannah cigarettes, Place of the Constitution, Catholic clergy with three-cornered hats-but
in the life and habits of the people the greatest resemblance. Among the young women you meet charming
figures and faces, and among the old, dragons such as only
the South can show.

We drove to the Castle Hill, through varied streets and
even poorer houses, in droskies which would have done
honour to a Residence town in Germany. The road winds
in zigzags up a steep slope. Right and left are hedges
of cactus, and fruit trees, with here and there a palm.
