boats. Some Nubian soldiers, in pure white uniforms, but
of European cut, stood on guard. For the first time we
enjoyed close at hand the memorable and enchanting sight.
The lovely island of Philae presents itself surrounded with
masses of dark-coloured rock which rise directly from the

singing to keep time, took us across to the island.

The boat might, so far as its antiquarian shape went,
