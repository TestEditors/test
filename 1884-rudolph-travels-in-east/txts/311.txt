MEMPHIS, 189



railway-station. The train soon steamed away from Siut
to the north, and sweet sleep quickly settled on the
travellers. When I woke, early on the morning of the
15th, the sun was shining into the carriages, and we were
already in the neglected little station of Bedrashtn. We
breakfasted in the dirty waiting-room, and then started on
the ride to Memphis. The road ran between marshy pools,
well-kept fields, and great palm-forests, to the little village
of Mitrahenne, which lies hidden in the plenteous verdure
of African vegetation.

I will now let Brugsch take my place. "The tales and
traditions of the glory and the greatness of the old town
of Memphis, or, as it is called in Egyptian inscriptions,'
Menrmofir, Lie.' good pasture? have for ever passed away.
The temples and the houses of the old kings of Memphis
who had taken up their residence there have vanished from
the face of the earth, and not one single stone of the
ruins which remain awakes the recollection of the first
and earliest founders of the town. The space enclosed
by tumbling earth-walls, which extends by the palm-girt
village of Mitrahenne (old Minet-ra-hannu) to the north and
south, marks the centre of the vast abode of the Memphites,
the former site of the national sanctuary. Here stood the
temples of the god Ptah, the great artist and maker of all
created things. The sanctuary of this god, protected by
strongly fortified lines, which bore the name of t white wait'
or'white fortress,' formed the citadel of the town, in which
the palladium of the empire was vigorously defended
against all external and internal foes, throughout the whole
period of Egyptian history.
