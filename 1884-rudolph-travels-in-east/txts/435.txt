MESD5HrEL-A KSA. 289



Kubbet-erSachrii, stands in its centre, with a lofty
cupola, pillared vestibule, and a beautiful octagon hall-one
of the most renowned of Eastern edifices. Various small.
half-ruined monuments and wells stand between the chief
mosque and the buildings which abut on the enclosing
wall. The chief of these is the very beautiful Mesdjid-elAksa, a church built in the reign of the Emperor Justinian,
in honour of the Virgin, and afterwards appropriated by
Omar to the Mohammedans.

We were shown round by the chief dervish, an elderly
and capable-looking Mohammedan in bright apparel. The
population in Palestine, as in all other Asiatic Mohammedan
countries, is far more fanatical than in Egypt; and travellers
must be on their guard in no way to wound their feelings.
We went over both mosques carefully. In the centre of
the great octagon there is a huge block of stone, around
which the temple has been built. This rock may vouch
for the great uniformity of Eastern legends, and the Jews
also venerate it. The Talmud mentions it, and Hebrew
tradition teaches that Abraham and Melchisedek sacrificed
here; that here Abraham was about to slay Isaac, and
that Jacob also consecrated it. The ark of the covenant
stood here; and here the Jews believe it still remains,
having been hidden by Jeremiah. This rock is believed
to be the centre of the world. The same opinion is also
held of the Church of the Sepulchre, where the spot is
indicated by a small stone.

It is an interesting fact that the great mosque stands on
the site of the Temple of Solomon, and the Moslems adopted
all the Hebrew traditions, and added them to their own
