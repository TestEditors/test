42 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



I frequently saw several persons at a time go through
this pious purification, and the little basin has neither intake
nor outlet! In all the corridors, courts, and halls of the
mosque, throngs of people pass in and out, often most
striking in appearance in their long robes; and frightful

and founded here a city, which bore the name of the tent.
Amr himself built the mosque, which is called after him
