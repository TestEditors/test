THE "BARRAGE DU NI." 231



represented. We then steamed past several long sandy
islands, and the curious bridge-like building of the bar
came' into view.

The arms of the Nile divide here-that of Damietta
from that of Rosetta. It is the southernmost point of the
Delta. The tongue of land which divides the two branches
is united to the mainland by the iron bridges and the
gigantic weirs built by Mehmet Ali. Their purpose is to
keep back the river at the time of .low water, so that the
innumerable canals of the Delta may be supplied with
water then, as well as during the inundation.

The results of this enterprise, which at the same time
paralyzed the navigation of the N ile, are said to bear no
proportion to the great outlay incurred. A fort was built
at great cost on the tongue of land. between the weirs.
This isolated fort lies very low, and is little better than a
toy. A few old-fashioned guns, and a barrack with a small
garrison within, maintain its warlike aspect. The most
remarkable feature of the whole are the very fine and tall
rows of trees which adorn this otherwise desolate spot.

We had to see it all, and were taken round the fort as
well as the weirs. After our survey the steamer set out for
home. We stopped at a long narrow island covered with
sand and bushy thickets, and searched it for game. Besides
some small water-bird, I shot a specimen of the beautiful
pale-chester, harder. A shallow clayey branch of the river
divides the island from the mainland, and across this ford
are driven great flocks of sheep and goats which feed on the

bushes. On the banks of the N ile we found several poor
fishing cabins.
