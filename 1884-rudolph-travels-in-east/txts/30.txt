6 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



T here are singularly few towns on the Albanian coast.
Here and there you catch sight of the flat-rooted, brightly
coloured houses of a village built in steps on the declivity
and standing amidst gloomy cypresses and grey green olives.

By noon the lovely Greek island of Corfu came in sight,
and to the west of it the rocky islets of Merlera and Fano.
The passage between Corfu and the mainland is unquestionably one of the most beautiful pieces of scenery known.
To the east the Albanian mountains stretch round the broad
basin and valley of Butrinto. In the midst of the valley a
fine mountain lake, surrounded by extensive forests of oak
and great marshes, contrasts with the bare limestone
mountains, whose lofty summits, soaring in the background,
are visible from afar.

Westward, i.e. to the right, lies the green island, with
its beautifully formed hills, its proud Mount Decca, its
rustling oak and olive woods, its many cypresses and its
flowering fruit trees, and, scattered everywhere over the
whole island, dazzlingly white houses and villages. Truly,
a remarkable contrast-to the left, the wild uncultivated
Albania, inhabited by quarrelsome mountaineers; to the
right, the flowery Corfu, converted by the tractable, commerce-loving Greek into a luxuriant garden.

We passed the bay of Ipsa, and both citadel and town
of Corfu came into view, well placed on the central and
salient promontory of the island.

Whenever I see Corfu, Homer takes possession of my
thoughts, and fills them so long as the ship is passing
amongst these Ionian Islands. In younger days, when
reading the Odyssey, I formed a picture of these islands
