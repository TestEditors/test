308 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



to protect the holy places from invasion by the Arab
tribes, whose abodes are not very remote, and who are
quite lawless. The church, with its chapels and halls, bears
the character of the earliest Christian, i.e. Byzantine, times.
Unhappily many of the most ancient mosaics and paintings
are effaced or have fallen off, and the statues are broken.
The church, too, is not well kept up as a whole. One sees
at every turn in its interior the results of the compromise
between the three rites. Altars, fonts, and shrines of the
different religions stand close beside each other. Franciscans and Greek priests walk about in numbers. Few
pilgrims, and they chiefly Russian peasants, were there on
this occasion; but all the more inhabitants, as the town is
Christian, followed us in our rounds, among them the
most beautiful and picturesque figures which fancy can
pourtray.

The most interesting parts are the subterranean grottoes.
We reached the brightly lighted Chapel of the Nativity by
a flight of steps, and through doors from the church. In a
niche to the east is an altar; beneath it a silver star is let
into the ground, and round it are the words, "Hic de
Virgine Maria Jesus Christus natus est."

The narrow, gloomy chamber makes a great impression
on the pilgrim, and ancient mysticism, the weight of tradition, and the conviction that here Christianity was born,,
and that from hence went forth that religion which has
changed the face of the world, stirs solemn and sublime
emotions. Unbidden he falls on his knees and kisses the
stone which thousands of lips have pressed in the lapse of
ages, breathing vows of fidelity with pious fervour.
