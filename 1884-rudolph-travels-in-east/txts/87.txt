preserved in the mosque, and a great festival celebrated
in his honour each year, during fourteen days of the month
Rabiet-Tani, the fourth of the Mohammedan year.

We drew on slippers, and a kindly dervish conducted
us into the building, the interior of which is of handsome
architecture and richly decorated.

Several people, by their dress wealthy Orientals, were
seated in a circle on rich carpets, and read in low tones
out of ancient books the wise maxims of the Koran. Meanwhile, a specially learned man squatted in the midst of the
faithful, and explained the most important passages. Other
worshippers knelt or lay flat on the ground, and went
through their prayers with faces turned towards Mecca.

Here, as elsewhere in mosques, a point, gaily adorned
with green velvet and gilding, marked the direction of the
Mohammedans' holiest spot on earth. Great chandeliers
hung from the cupola, and the genuine Oriental arrange,
ments of the temple, no less than the demeanour of the
faithful, claimed the full attention of the strangers,

In an adjacent court, of fine architecture, is the basin
for the holy ablutions. The look of this bath, with its
border of flat stones, gives the idea of exquisite cleanliness.
On further inquiry, one realizes how disgusting is the
practice which the Koran imposes on its votaries. Before
a Mohammedan may enter the holiest part of a mosque,
he must undergo a certain minutely prescribed purification.
In a squatting posture, to the accompaniment of murmured
prayers, the washing begins. Propriety forbids that I
should describe its further course. When all is done the
pious man prayerfully enters the house of God.
