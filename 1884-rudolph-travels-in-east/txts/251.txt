its remains of buildings of the earlier periods of Egyptian
history, is now only visited by travellers because of its
picturesque position at the entrance of the gate of the
cataracts. Its former glory has departed'since the capital
of the Nubian country which once stood upon it, and the
temples and statues which belonged to it, have been swept
from the face of the earth.

"At this spot there was, down to Roman times, astrong
garrison, which had the duty of protecting the country
against incursions from a southern direction. The old wall
on the road from Assuan to the island of Philae had the.
like purpose, that of a bulwark against predatory attacks
from the south. Its remains, half covered with sand, can
still be distinctly traced."

known in Assuan as a sportsman, led us through the town
to the furthest houses. He advised us to pause there for
a few minutes, as the wild beasts seeking their prey visit the
outer parts of Assuan nightly at the beginning of twilight.
