14 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



drenched by heavy rain, we set forth in haste to return to
the Miramar.

The next morning brought no favourable tidings from
the open sea, so our captain resolved to spend at least a
day in Zante.

We decided thereupon to ascend Mount Skopo. On
the quay we got into carriages drawn by very small horses,
and drove through several streets, past the last houses of the
town, out along the coast. The carriage road very soon
came to an end, and we took our way on foot through
gardens and fields, among olive trees, and across dry watercourses, to the foot of the mountain. There the company
'divided for the ascent into two parties. I climbed past the
last human habitations, and then up the steep slope, thickly
overgrown with evergreen shrubs, on to some slabs of rock
and heaps of rubble.

The ascent was laborious and uninteresting. The sun
burnt fiercely, and we had needlessly burdened ourselves
by carrying our guns. Four-footed game there was none,
and the feathered world was poorly represented: only some
central European species, in their winter quarters.

At the top of the mountain there is a small Greek shrine,
simple and unattractive, and beside it the abode of the
priest and his servant; the whole dirty, ruinous, neglected.

Near this dwelling rises a cone of rocks of peculiar
formation. It is visible from afar, and had attracted our
attention from the sea the day before. This, as the highest
point, had to be scaled, and so we scrambled up toilsomely
over the large rock to the summit, to place there a pockethandkerchief on a pole by way of banner.
