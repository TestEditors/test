than in Central Europe, as his word is law with all the
wild tribes. Formerly this was not so, for the Bedouins
were in constant strife and deadly warfare amongst
themselves, and to have the friendship of one tribe
sufficed to expose the traveller to the hostility of all
the others.

The sage patriarch has now united almost all the tribes
under his rule, and the region whose nomad population
obeys him blindly is well-nigh boundless. Thousands of
horsemen, bold militant sons of the desert, do his bidding,
and a kind of caliphate has thus arisen. After brief
discourse Sheik Ali took ceremonious leave of us. A
dignified repose marks the demeanour of these people,
and a proud self-consciousness such as one seldom sees
in like measure in Europe. They then mounted their
noble steeds, and, surrounded by a faithful group of lancers,
the nomad king rode back to his boundless steppes.

The governor of Nablous, a genuine Turcoman, an
agreeable and very cultivated man, and ever most
desirous to comply with our wishes, was also waiting for
us at the tents. He wore the robe of a Pasha, but on
account of the heat had white cloths stretched over
his fez.

We breakfasted hastily; no one could eat much. The
air grew more oppressive towards midday, and persistent
and insatiable thirst extinguished all appetite in this
region, lying as it does below the level of the sea. After
a rest of one hour some of the travelling party broke
up to employ the afternoon and evening hours in the
chase.
