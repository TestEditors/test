52 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



antiquity have sunk to the level of a Rigi, and the insignificant names of the Western tourist desecrate the
venerable stones.

We viewed the Cheops, Chefren, and Menkera Pyramids, and also the Sphinx with its body half buried by the
sands of the desert, and then some Arabs were set to
climb the second pyramid, to dislodge the jackals which
house there. Unfortunately we were badly placed, and
so two jackals escaped unharmed and betook themselves
to the boundless desert, intersected by vales and hills.
Several shots were fired from below at the beasts as they
came down, hopping with extraordinary agility among
the stones, but none took effect, as the distance was too
great.

The Pyramids gave me, especially when men or animals
were climbing upon them, the impression of being great
artificially constructed mountains rather than architectural
monuments.

The sun went down and the landscape floated in a sea
of the most glorious light, the grey stones of the Pyramids
glowed like gold, and the Valley of the Nile, the mass of
houses of Cairo, the citadel, and the towering Mokattam
mountains beyond were dyed in crimson hues. We had to
hasten home, and drove quickly back by the road by which
we had come.

In the Schubra Avenue-the Prater of Cairo-we found
plenty of stir. Riders capered on beautiful Arab horses,
and there were two closely serried rows of carriages driving
up and down; it was a Corso lively and gay, such as only
the South can show, and all unlike our northern caricature
