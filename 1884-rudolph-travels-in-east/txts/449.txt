A HAUNT FOR THE VULTURE. 297



We rode back by the walls from the Valley of Kedron
towards our camp. At the slaughter-yard I dismounted
and made a fruitless attempt to approach a carrion vulture.
Hundreds of large vultures soared aloft, and dogs haunted
the bloody spot. The horrible smell obliged me to make
a speedy flight.
