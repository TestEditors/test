Erment has played its part in antiquity. In Greek its
name is Hermonthis; in old Egyptian, Anmonth. Lying
on the west bank of the Nile, and southward from Thebes,
this town, with its temples dedicated to the god Month (the
last of which fell a prey but a few years back to Egyptian
barbarism), had the character of one of the most holy
places.

After the political decline of the old imperial city of
Thebes, Erment became the metropolis of the Thebais, and
was the actual seat of government of the Greco-Roman
authorities for this part of Upper Egypt. The fragments
of a column of black granite found on the bank at Erment
are now in the Imperial collection at Vienna.

who has taken possession by force of all the country, of
the divine benefactor, of the Lord who makes rich, of
the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Ra-a-cheperu, of
the very own son of the Sun-god Ra, who loves him,
of the Lord of all people, Amenholp, of the god-like
ruler of Hermonthis, of the friend of the great god Chnum
of Elephantine.
