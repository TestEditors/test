326 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



ascetics of the first centuries. The traveller involuntarily
fancies himself carried back to the days of the hermits of
Mount Athos and other holy places at the dawn of Christendom, where in the far East pious men who have since
been canonized lived in ceaseless prayer in caves and dens.

Such was the early Christian Church. It was Eastern,
and the Mar-Saba of our day has kept itself pure and
uncontaminated at the level of those pious hermits of the
third and fourth centuries. It is no convent according to
European ideas, but a settlement of hermits, a group of
solitaries living independently, but gathered into a narrow
space by common dangers.

N either learning nor luxury have place on this mountain, nothing but prayer; daily the same continuous worship,
complete self-annihilation and mortification. A child of
the nineteenth century, of purely Western training, cannot
conceive of such a life. Only the East could produce the
fanaticism which still holds its ground there. The rabbis,
who wail at the wall of the temple; the dervishes, who
pass their whole lives in squatting or turning or mutilating
themselves-in what do they differ P The substance is the
same; the form alone is changed.

The ascetics of Mar-Saba eat only bread and vegetables. The loud bell of the convent calls the hermits
daily to the church to united prayer. N ightly at the twelfth
hour they celebrate high Mass, and the old Greek chants
do not cease till morning breaks. I found some Russians
among the brothers, Transylvanians, Wallachians, Sclavonians, Servians, and Bulgarians, but by far the most were
Greeks from Europe and Asia Minor.
