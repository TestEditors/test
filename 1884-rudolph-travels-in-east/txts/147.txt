WE CAPTURE THE PREV. 87





this cleft as well as we could, and I sounded with a pole
the interior of the cover. When I withdrew the stake
it had some grey lynx-hairs on it. Looking cautiously in,
we saw the green eyes of the lynx sparkling. Hereupon
I drove the stake in as far as I could towards the beast,
and in a few moments felt that the soft body disappeared.
The hunt underground was now perceptible, and the
scuffle of the escaping lynx with the dogs.

In a few seconds more the grey fellow sprang with
long leaps from the funnel by which the Grand Duke
stood. A well-directed shot received him there. Half
staggering, half dragging himself along, the severely
wounded creature reached shelter under a big rock.
Luckily the brave dogs held the lynx by his hind quarters,
and so Prince Taxis succeeded, by creeping under the
rock, in giving him a thrust with his hunting knife. A
handsome but much weaker specimen, a female, not
nearly so big and powerful as the buck killed by me, lay
before us.

After this triumph we renounced further search and
went, with the weary and more or less injured dogs,
back to our camp.

The weather had grown worse during the forenoon.
A light grey cloud covered the whole sky, and fine rain
fell between whiles, which in these regions is a most rare
occurrence. The north wind increased, and instead of the
scorching heat of the previous day came coolness which
the contrast made very perceptible. The water broke in
high waves, and the watermen declared that it was impossible under these circumstances to leave the island.
