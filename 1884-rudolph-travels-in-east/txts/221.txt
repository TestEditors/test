WATCHING FOR GAME. 129



my great joy, that a jackal was my prey. With this
valuable booty we soon reached the place where the asses
were waiting, and trotted back to our steamer very
contentedly.

Following the advice of Chalil, some of us started
next morning, long before sunrise, and rode across country
past the ruins of Karnak, to a pond where the great beasts
of prey are wont to drink daily at twilight.

The way was long and the stillness of death reigned in
the vast pai-one now and then the howl of jackals or
the bark of the half-savage dogs broke the stillness of the
night. I

At last we reached the pond, or, to describe it more
truly, the water left behind in a ditch by the overflow of
the Nile. Chalil placed the guns quickly, and we watched
with the keenest attention until the sun rose golden red
over the Arabian Nile. Nothing had been seen but one
jackal, which Herr Rath had let slip.

The brief transition from night, through twilight, to
sunrise was rich in variety of effect and glow of colour,
with a magic which only the interior of Africa can display.

Many birds of all kinds came to water, and so we
resolved to pass the forenoon in sport. We killed plenty
of small game, amongst them several kinds of quail, a great
abundance of which find winter quarters here. Rambling
over the fields we reached the ruins of Karnak. Several
of the gentlemen now returned to Luxor, while I remained
behind, choosing an ambush among the ruins to watch
near carrion for the great vulture. Unfortunately, only kite
and carrion vultures appeared, at which I would not fire.
