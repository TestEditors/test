A WOLF-HUNT. 77



sport, when Baron Saurma summoned us to him. He had
discovered a great sugar-cane plantation, and had resolved
to drive it with dogs. Our only difficulty was to get rid of
the numerous labourers, in order to secure a free range for
our guns. The gentlemen were to post themselves round
the field, and Saurma proposed to drive, with my huntsman
and the pack of fourteen dogs, through the canes, which
were the height of a man. We had not all got to our
places ere we heard the merry bark of the dogs, followed
by two shots. One of our party, rightly taking in the
situation, had hurried forward, hoping to be the first to
reach the further side of the field. He was still on his
way, when the dogs drove a large wolf within a few steps
of him into the open field. Unfortunately, through dire
ill-luck, the small shot destined for plover and heron was
still in the barrels, and, vainly fired at from both, Master
Isegrimm hastened across an open space to the nearest
cover.

In a short time the dogs were driving with noisy barks
in all parts of the cane-field. Many shots were heard.
Two of the sportsmen had fired twice at wolves, but all in
vain, as the crafty beasts only left the canes for one or two
bounds, and again disappeared into them. Many shots
were fired'at the wolves on chance as they rushed through
the thick plantation. Frequently the baying of the dogs
and streaks of blood showed that some at least of the shots
had taken effect. Several of the gentlemen, overcome by
the ardour of the chase, left their posts and followed the
baying; but among the canes it was impossible to see two
steps in front, and all their efforts were fruitless.
