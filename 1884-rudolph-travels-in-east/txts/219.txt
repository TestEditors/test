THE ABABDEHS. 127



race, who in the earliest days of migration-those of the
Kushites--took the southern line in these wanderings of
nations, and, following the coast of the Indian Ocean and
the southern frontier of Arabia, arrived in Africa. These
remarkable clans settled in Abyssinia and beyond it, in the
territory of the Somals, and up to Assuan, and even Thebes.

The Ababdehs in particular form even now a rigidly
separated class, which inhabits the mountains east of the
Nile, between the river and the Red Sea, beginning at
Thebes and extending southwards beyond Assuan.
They are a poor mountain people, who live in the wild
ravines of the desert mountains, and have maintained their
type unchanged, remaining at the very lowest stage of
development.

They are savages, untamed, in the full sense of the
word. The copper-coloured skin, the slender figure, and
the delicate features tell of their Indian origin. Their hair
is black, but disfigured by greasy unguents and plaiting
into various horned points supported on pieces of wood, to
such a degree that it is impossible to detect its original
character. Their clothing consists of some dirty, scanty
rags wound closely round the body.

They all wore roughly made ear and arm rings, indeed
one little boy had a nose ring. Their arms, old swords--among them a European blade, a knightly weapon from
the times of the Crusaders-wooden clubs, primitive
javelins, leather shields, arrows, bows and quivers, claimed
special attention; but they would not readily sell any of
them, and it needed the intervention of Abd-el-Kader
Pasha to procure the whole lot for me.
