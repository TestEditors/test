212 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



world, a colossal lagoon, separated by a narrow line of
dunes from the sea. Its western and southern boundaries
are long reaches of marsh, and to the east it finds its
outlet at the inner dyke of the Canal of Suez.

Leaving Damietta you have to the north the yellow
line of dunes; to the south, in the far distance, the green
margin of the term yirmas to the east the prospect is
extensive, and land and water melt into each other as at
sea. At first we saw but few islands, and those at a great
distance.

The depth of the lake throughout its forty-five square
miles is nowhere greater than would reach the hips. The
bottom is stiff clay. In storms, which are sometimes very
violent, drowning is precluded by the fact that one can
stand and walk in all parts of it, so one gets at worst a
copious bath.

In the winter months this lagoon is literally covered
by migratory birds of all kinds, and especially ducks and
geese. In the second half of March one could only
reckon on the home birds and some late-travelling northern
species. The sea and imperial eagles, which frequent
the lake in great numbers in winter, were also absent,
and only some spotted eagles "lere seen among the
islands.

We agreed to separate at first and take different lines,
but all to keep within sight, and to meet at noon at a given
signal for luncheon. We soon saw some pelicans swimming, but an attempt to get near them in a small boat
failed as usual, and we pursued our way in the dahabiy√©.

After a short sail we got into the region of the islands.
