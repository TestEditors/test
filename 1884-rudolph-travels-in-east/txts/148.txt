88 TRAVELS IN THE EAST,



Here we were then, like Robinson Crusoe, cut off from
all the world and confined to this little island. In our
camp our huntsmen set up a very pretty and singular display. From the cords of the tents they hung the game
we had caught. Two lynx, the skin of yesterday's wolf,
Pausinger's pelican, and two eagles, looked right well. Our
skin-dresser had his hands full and worked well and
quickly.

After a sumptuous luncheon, which our excellent Hassan
served to us, we smoked pleasantly outside the tents,
enjoying the glorious life of an Eastern camp, until
suddenly I discovered that the northern point of the
island, the level between the shore and the rock, was
covered with birds of all kinds. With the glass I could
see flocks of herons, pelicans, gulls, and among them some
river eagles.

I crept as best I could along the shore, under cover,
towards the half-sleeping, brooding company. I had nearly
reached them when, to my dismay, I saw two pelicans
swimming about on the lake as sentries. On two sides
J .had no .cover. It was all up: the crafty birds had
already spied me, and rose. That was the signal for the
multitude on land, and with noisy flapping of wings
the company dispersed in wild disorder in every possible
direction.

Only the inquisitive gulls wanted to know what the
cause was, and floated over me screeching. To my great
delight I discovered, among many smaller birds, one of the
large brown-headed fishing-gulls, a fine and to me new
species. -A successful shot brought it into my bag.
