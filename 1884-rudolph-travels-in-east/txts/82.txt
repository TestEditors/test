38 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



was a picture so rich and grand in colour, and so full of
points of natural and architectural interest, that it would
be difficult for imagination to conceive anything finer.

The disused and ruined mosque of Kasr-el-Ain stands
amidst heaps of wreck and decay. Its old walls are
inhabited by quantities of stone-plovers, that curious marsh
bird of nocturnal habits. At nightfall they leave their
hiding-places with the shrill unceasing cry whose tones are
heard all night long in Egypt, and make for the Nile.

We posted ourselves all along the mosque, and watched
for the appearance of this strange bird. As it grew dark,
several of them left their holes; but they were so swift,
that Hoyos was the only one among us who succeeded in
bringing one down. We scrambled over the ruins, pursued by the yelping of the dogs we had roused, and stared
at inquisitively by Arabs, who crept out of their holes, till
we regained our carriages.

The drive home had to proceed slowly at first. We
could only grape our way in the darkness through the
complicated ruins of Old Cairo. We then came to gardens,
and at last reached the modern town, with its well-lighted
busy streets.

On reaching home, we dined; and after dinner came
a brilliant torch-light procession, got up by our countrymen
in the gardens of Kasr-en-Nusha. "God save the
Emperor! "and their shouts and cheers, sounded strangely
through the still splendour of an African night. When
this ovation came to an end, we all retired to rest.

Early on the 20th we drove through the older part of the
Arab quarters, to be present at Mass in the Coptic church.
