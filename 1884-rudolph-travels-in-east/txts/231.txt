EDFU. I37



divans, smoked pleasantly, and drank coffee, and the first
civilities were scarcely over when the doors opened and
light-footed maidens came in to dance to appropriate music.
The girls here were not beautiful; only one, an
Abyssinian, had well-marked features and a dazzling
brownish-black complexion. After a short stay we took
leave of the Mudir and returned to the steamer.

We began our journey very early on the 6th of March,
and soon reached the defile of El-Kab, a beautiful district
where the mountains on each side advance to the river in
wild and romantic outline.

After this narrow passage the Libyan desert retreats,
giving place to the broad and well-cultivated plain of
Edfu, while the Arabian mountains still continue to skirt
the N ile. The character of the mountains also changes:
instead of lofty shapely hills come wild shattered sandstone mountains whose low summits and peaks assume
most peculiar shapes.

In the forenoon the vessel reached Edfu. We rode
across some fields to the very poor village hard by, and
through its dirty narrow streets to where, on its further
side, amidst heaps of ruin and rubbish, stands the
best-preserved temple of Upper Egypt and one of the
finest pieces of architecture of all time.

We at once began our inspection of the building under
Brugsch Pasha's guidance. Edfu is the old Egyptian
Debu or Edbu, in Greek "Apollonopolis" the Great.
The temple of Edfu, justly accounted one of the greatest
and most extensive sanctuaries, has existed from antiquity
to the present day in wonderful preservation.
