22 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



character. Many civilians were also to be seen, Levantines,
Greeks, Italians, and Jews, with or without the fez.

The members of the Austro-Hungarian community
came off to us in gaily decorated steam launches, and a
band gave us "God save the Emperor." Dalmatians in
the green and white costume of the valleys of the Bocchi
di Cattaro, their weapon-proof "Pas" round their slight
figures, waved their caps as they cheered. These Oriental
Christians were in remarkable contrast with the equally
splendid Eastern colouring of the Islamites. The medley
of flags, colours, costumes, uniforms all around us in innumerable boats could only be compared to a kaleidoscope.
Long after we had reached our buoy the people hovered
inquisitively around the ship.

The Consul-General, Baron Schaffer, soon came on

short greetings from them we had to receive the local
dignitaries, who came in a procession of gala barges. At
their head was Mustapha Pasha, the Minister of Foreign
Affairs. His master had sent him from Cairo to receive
us. Then followed several generals and the harbourmaster. Abd-el-Kadir Pasha was also present in the
uniform of an Egyptian General of Division. The
Khedive had the goodness to assign this agreeable
and cultivated man of half-Turkish, half-Arab race to
attend upon us for the whole of our Egyptian journey. We
one and all of us learned to value and esteem him, and we
parted from him after our prolonged daily intercourse with
true regard. As soon as the Egyptian magnates withdrew
the Austrian settlers appeared.
