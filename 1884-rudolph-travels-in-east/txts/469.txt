MASS IN THE CHAPEL OF THE NATIVITY. 313



ravines of Palestine, especially in the evening. One can
imagine how well adapted such spots are to wild beasts;
hyaenas, wolves, and jackals assemble and howl by the old
tombs. I left the damp chill place before it grew quite
dark, and hastened past the village to the camp. A
shadow flitted by me, and on a chance shot a poor
stork fell mortally wounded,

Next morning we started early and rode to Bethlehem.
There was again a great crowd, and it was with difficulty
that we pushed through to the church door on our neighing,
capering horses. The Franciscans accompanied our party
to the Chapel of the Nativity, where the chaplain said
Mass. The public had pressed after us into the holy places
underground, and some wonderfully beautiful women of
Bethlehem knelt on the bare rock, strangely lighted by
the dull glow of the lamps..

After the service we hastened to the square where our
horses stood. A great surprise awaited me there. On the
terrace of a house lay a colossal hyaena with a wondrous'
skin and long mane, and beside it two jackals smaller and
different in colour from that of the previous day, but larger
than, and differing altogether in appearance from, the
Egyptian Canis aureus. The poison had taken effect.
The day before, the head of the ass which was left had been
saturated with a strong dose of strychnine and left on the
spot. Naturally the half-starved beasts of the lonely spot
fell greedily on the dainty morsel and found in it speedy
death. I sent the prize on the back of a donkey to the tent
of our skin-dresser.

We rode back the same way as the day before to Tantur
