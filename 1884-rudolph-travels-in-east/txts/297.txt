MtusrNETmABis, 179



The deepest stillness prevailed in the monotonous
country round. The mountains rose in dim -outlif1e, .and
the yellow desert seemed interminable. I heard the
stealthy prowl of the jackal several times, and saw shadows
Hit by, and once even distinguished the form of a wolf;
but the much-wished-for hyaena did not come,

The right hour for this timid beast is the first after
midnight; but on this occasion also sleep so overcame me
that by eleven o'clock I was unable longer to resist it. I
left the ambush.' The Arab let me go with a reproachful
look, and resolved to wait, armed with his gun, for the
hyama.

A long but lovely ride lay before me. The moonlit
nights of Egypt belong to the most bewitching, memories
which I have brought with me from the glorious land of
the Pharaohs. The Colossi of Memnon stood ghost-like
and grand by night in the dark green of the landscape.
Near the Nile a wolf ran across a few steps in front of me;
unluckily my gun was not loaded. It was very late when.
I reached the steamer and my much-desired rest.

Early on the 12th, we all rode the same way to
Medinet-Habu. Long rows of storks stood on the sandbanks and in the water-pools; and I shot snipe and sandpipers while mounted on my donkey.

After an hour's ride we reached the village of MedinetHabu, where the Arab hunter was already waiting to tell
us that he had happily missed the hyaena about one o'cl6ck
at night. I did not believe him, and resolved to look at
the spot myself, and also to bestow my attention on the
vultures, which, according to the report of the Arab, were
assembled there in numbers.
