A AIISSIONARY. 243



There were but few guests in the neglected English
hotel; only some English men of business taking brief rest
on the great highway between Europe and India, and an
unfortunate but extremely amusing missionary, a Saxon
lieutenant in the Reserve and preacher all in one. He
desired to convert the natives in the interior of Africa, and
was well up in the theory, both of the importance of his
mission and of the country to which he was proceeding, but
in practice he seemed devoid of tact, experience, and above
all of money, and to be awaiting in the hotel at Suez what
favourable chances might bring. We rose early on the
morning of the 25th of March, and after a hasty breakfast
left the hotel and went through the town to the landingplace of the steamers.

I am indebted to my friend Brugsch Pasha for such
an admirable description of this district, that I cannot do
better than quote the letter, so rich in scientific observation,
of this eminent scholar.

"On the north side of the town there is a small hill
piled with ruins, whose Arab name Tell-Kolzum (Hill of
Kolzum) recalls its more ancient name Clysma, which was
that of a well-built harbour-fortress, formerly existing on
this spot. With the decay of the old canal the town lost
its importance, but its memory is still kept alive by Arab
authors, who often employ the name Bahr-Kolzum to
designate the present Gulf of Suez. Instructive as may
be a visit to the modern harbour, with its works, dykes,
and the mouths and sluices of the sea and sweet water
canals, it can only tell us of the chief doings of our own day
ii, the domain of mechanical engineering applied to water.
