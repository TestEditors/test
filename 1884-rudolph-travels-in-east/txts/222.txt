I36 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.

The day was ill-suited to this kind of sport, for thick
clouds of sand filled the air, hiding even the nearer
mountains from view. The champsin had returned in
the morning with renewed violence. I soon quitted my
old Egyptian ambush, and went to a small reservoir of
water, bordered with slabs of stone, which lies within the
ruins and is of ancient date. Several snipe and sand-pipers,
probably overcome by fatigue on the journey, sat pitifully
on the bare stones. A brief crusade put an end to their
troubled existence.

I now rode by the nearest path back to Luxor and the
steamer. We had planned for the afternoon a first visit
to the monuments on the western shore, but were obliged
to change our plans because of the steadily growing storm
which raged, and we resolved to pursue our further journey
next day, and to reserve the west side of Thebes until
our return from the cataracts.

The afternoon was spent partly on board and partly in
Luxor itself. I went with Brugsch Pasha to visit the
German consular agent, a Copt, and a dealer in.Egyptian
antiquities. We found he had better things than his
English colleague of the preceding day. We bought several
valuable articles and put them on board the steamer, where
an Egyptian museum was growing apace.

On the 5th we proceeded on our voyage at sunrise.
By the advice of some Europeans in Luxor we resolved to
stop at the neighbouring village of Erment, known for its
sugar factory and its extensive sugar-cane plantations, and
to devote some hours to hunting there.

After a two hours' voyage welad reached our point.
