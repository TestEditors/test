24 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



In the narrow Arab quarters of the town one learnt
their value, for without them one would have passed with
difficulty and many stoppages through the throng of men
and beasts.'

No sooner had we left the harbour precincts by its large
portal than full Eastern life burst upon us. A narrow street
of houses of Arabic style was crowded with people of all
descriptions; screaming donkey-drivers, the indispensable
water-carriers, vendors of all kinds, blue fellaheen shirts
jostling pure white burnous. Women whose dresses hung
in rich folds, bearing antique pitchers on their heads; blind
beggars with long staves; urchins, clamorous and riotous
as nowhere else but in the East. The Turks and natives
of Asia Minor, in their richly coloured dresses, struck us
at once; even in expression they differ entirely from the
Arabs, and their skin is lighter. The true Arab is dark,
his features are handsome and noble, his figure is slight but
muscular-in every respect superior to, but still unmistakably like, the Israelite. The fellaheen of the cultivated
hill lands is no true Arab. He is of the type ordinarily
found in the likenesses of the ancient Egyptians. I hold
him to be the original inhabitant of the country, and propose in another place to enter more fully into this matter.

W hen we had traversed these short Oriental streets we
came to the European part of the town. Broad streets,
with handsome Western houses and shops, form that
quarter of the town; the central and most brilliant point
appears to be the Place Mehmet Ali. It were uninteresting to dwell further on the common features of a

European seaport.
