SHEIK A LI. 337



He seemed the impersonation of those recollections of
Scripture stories, familiar from early childhood, to which I
alluded as crowding on my mind on first entering the Holy
Land-the lineal representative of the prophets and rulers
of patriarchal times, or those later wise men who brought
their offerings to the infant Christ in His cradle, and must
have looked as did Sheik Ali when he stood before us in
flesh and blood, the living embodiment of a thousand years
which had brought no change.

Again I was impressed by the absolutely stationary
aspect of life in these regions. Tents have not been
replaced by towns, nor has civilization, under the guise of
improvement, shackled the existence or changed the
character of these children of the desert, who still move
free and uncontrolled over the steppes and mountains.
The pride of their-chiefs still consists in a pastoral wealth
of flocks and herds, and in the martial resources furnished
by a thousand valiant combatants on swift coursers. The
regions over which they roam have no boundaries. The
plots of pasture ground determine the places where their
tents shall be pitched.

I was glad to see this (in his own way) mighty
monarch, and thankful to understand by this meeting
that the Turkish authorities had placed us, with friendly
urgency, under his protection. And this protection is
absolutely indispensable for a journey beyond the Jordan;
for the river is the frontier, and from it to Bagdad is the
free territory of lawless tribes. No Caliph is acknowledged;
they feel themselves nearer to Mecca than to the Osman,
and no one would dare to force his way with arms along
