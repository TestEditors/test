RETURN TO OUR SAND-BANK STATION. tth



In Palestine this diversity is even more distinctly noticeable. On the whole, the Asiatic jackal is larger than the
North African, and amongst several which were tolerably
like each other, I shot one which could not be compared
with any previous specimen, either in size or colour, and
yet one could not describe this abnormal creature as a
wolf.

The dogs of the East, however, often bear traces of
savage origin, which is in no way surprising when one
remembers their uncontrolled, ownerless life on the one
hand, and on the other the nightly prowlings, frequently
from dusk to dawn, of wolves and jackals in the immediate
vicinity of the towns and villages.

I go so far as to assert that in those parts of Africa and
Asia where dogs, wolves, and jackals inhabit a limited
area, the jackal of pure race, as a true species, does not
exist. The dog and the wolf are better preserved; but the
Canis aureus of scientific books I have sought in vain as a
distinctly marked breed..

Let us now revert to our travelling adventures. The
steamer proceeded till ten in the forenoon, when we stopped
at Dabbabieh, by the sand-bank on which, in our upward
course, I had seen the large eared vulture sitting. On
landing we found the fellaheen, who had punctually
obeyed our orders

A small reed hut had been erected; and the bones
of sheep and dogs showed that the vultures had had their
daily bait. We had great difficulty in ridding ourselves of
the inquisitive fellaheen, who, proud of their performances, now wished to be present at the sport.
