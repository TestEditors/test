2 mg VELS IN THE EAST.



On the 9th February our travelling party assembled at
the Southern station in Vienna. It was a cold, bleak, winter
evening. Snow lay in the streets, and thick clouds covered
the sky; right gloomy weather for departure, and such as
our treacherous climate too often bids our poor European
race endure..

But two days before I had left the railway, after a long
and rapid journey from the distant west of Europe. I had
hastened home to follow a faithful friend on his last journey
to his long home. With this saddening thought I stepped
into the carriage The cold we then endured alone filled
us with pleasant anticipations-for soon it must give place
to the glorious warmth of the glowing East. A whistle,
and the train moved puffing out of the station. It was
pitch dark outside; snow, sleet, and storm were our
farewell.

A small but enterprising travelling party were assembled
in the sleeping-can My uncle, the Grand Duke of Tus..
cany, General Count Waldburg, the Court Chaplain, Abbot
Mayer, Major von Eschenbacher, Count Joseph Hoyos,
the artist Pausinger and I, were the pilgrims of the East.
Count Hans Wilczek accompanied us to the sea, whence
his way lay to Italy. One after another soon retired to
rest, and only Wilczek and I remained engaged in conversation, until at length, far on into the night, sleep
overcame us also.

The icy cold awoke the travellers in the early morning,
and shivering we drew closer to each other. The guard
told us that the thermometer showed twenty degrees of
cold, and the frosted, palm-like foliage on the windows
