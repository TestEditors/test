WE started before nightfall. The shades of evening covered
the misty outlines of the lofty hills of the Asiatic coast.
The waves beat high and some unquiet hours began. The
whole of the 13th was spent on the open sea in chilly
weather. Heavy clouds hung over the sky, and there was
stillness on the deck of the Miramar. Those of the travelling party who were well enough to appear on deck watched
the play of the waters, lost in thoughts of the glorious East.
In the quiet season sure to follow a time of such deep and
varied interest one dwells long on the memories of happy
days.

The 15th of April brought us less sea and the sight of
the Island of Candia, so rich in natural charms. We
passed close along the coast, admiring the snow-clad Mount
Ida. On the 16th we saw Cape Matapan, the Greek
mountains, and in the afternoon, Zante. We passed from
between the island, decked in all its spring glories, and the
Grecian mainland to the sombre summits of Cephalonia.
In a splendid moonlight we passed the famous channel of
Ithaca, the home of Ulysses, and saw the rock of Sappho
and the islands consecrated by Greek mythology. Early
