78 TRAVELS IN THE EAST.



During all this wild and somewhat irregular sport, I,
had not got a single shot. After half an hour's waiting,
when most of the gentlemen had already left their places in
order to get nearer to the barking dogs, I discovered a
cross road which led through the plantation.

I hastened along it to a spot where an irrigation channel
which ran into the interior of the cane-stock afforded a
narrow passage, not a yard wide, down which I could fire.
I planted myself there to await the advancing game. The
dogs approached but slowly, for the wounded wolf frequently turned to bay upon them. When at length the
great wolf passed within range, the dogs which surrounded
him prevented my firing. Further on the fight recommenced, and I heard the snarl of the wolf.mingle with
the clear bark of. the dachshunds. In a few moments the
pursuit-stopped, and all was still. The dachshunds hunt
the wolf unwillingly, and one cannot therefore depend either
on their persistent pursuit of one that has been wounded,
or on their giving tongue when one has died. The wolf
which does not drop on the spot is for the most part lost.

A few minutes more, and the bark of other dachshunds
in the opposite corner of the field told of the commencement of a new hunt. Again the hunt came across the
sugar-canes in my direction; again it came on, but very
slowly, and one could tell that the dogs had to deal with a
wounded wolf. When they came within a hundred paces
of me, I perceived that the eager dogs were at bay. Whilst
listening attentively to this contest, I heard suddenly, close
beside he, a gentle rustling, and immediately an unwounded

wolf crept along the narrow glade.
