LANDING AT 7AFFA. 263



for the whole of our journey in the Holy Land. These
great officers were of a distinctly different type from that
of the Egyptians. The complexions were lighter, the
features broader-in a word, more Turkish in character.
We were soon to learn that this country differs in every
respect from Egypt, Rizah-Pasha, a pleasant cultivated
man, in whose company we spent many interesting days,
handed me a letter from the Sultan. This high personage
was extraordinarily gracious to us, and we were to continue
to be his guests throughout our entire stay. To his
friendly favour we were indebted for a fine caravan, excellent tents, and many alleviations of the toilsome journey
which was to follow.

After brief greetings the Turkish gentlemen went on
shore to put off their gala uniforms and to make sundry
arrangements. We had ourselves rowed to land soon
after, not, as heretofore, in our own boats, but, as is the
custom here, because of the treacherous coast, in broad
flat-bottomed boats handled by natives. A skilful pilot
was at the helm, and the powerful strokes of his men's
oars soon bore us far from the Miramar. We were not
to see her again for a season, and during our journey
on land she was to anchor at Beyrout, the nearest safe
harbour. Two of the naval officers, Count Chorinsky
and Lieutenant Sachs, accompanied us into the Holy
Land.

We soon reached the dreaded circle of the ill-reputed
reef. As the boat glided through the narrow way between
two jagged rocks, one could readily imagine how perilous
the passage would be in wild weather and foaming surf.
