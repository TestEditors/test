TRACKS OF DEER. 363



came to the edge of the plateau, where a steep slope fell
before me. At the bottom of this I discerned, to my great
joy, green meadow and rich pasture, and among these the
silver streak of the Jordan, which makes a considerable
bend at this spot. The peninsula so formed is covered
with an underwood richer and more luxuriant than any

shadow of its last trees and bushes, but still on the meadow,
