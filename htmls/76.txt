The roads<br/>are wide and good, and shaded better than almost<br/>any other city with avenues of acacia (Albizzia<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">lebbek</span>), so that carriage-exercise is rendered very<br/>easy and agreeable.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Riding.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Excellent </span>country-bred and Syrian<br/>ponies can be hired by the day, but a visitor intending to spend the winter generally does better to<br/>buy a mount for £18 or £25. Donkey-riding is<br/>very cheap, very healthy, and at times enjoyable.<br/>Camels can be obtained for the desert, but are out<br/>of place in crowded streets rendered slippery by<br/>watering.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Doctors-commencing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with our own countrymen, there are two Aberdonians, who have been<br/>respectively twenty-seven and nine years in Egypt,<br/>and a Londoner, who has practised in Cairo for<br/>six years. There is another Englishman <span style="color: #0000FF;">who<br/></span>practises chiefly among the natives, and has a<br/>growing surgical reputation; six English doctors<br/>in the Government service are available for consultation; and there are always a similar number in<br/>the English Army. There are German, Scotch,<br/>and American oculists, a good English dentist,<br/>and more than a dozen foreign medical men (<span style="color: #0000FF;">some<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
