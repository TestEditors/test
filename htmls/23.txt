<span>Introduction. 7<br/><br/>sphere where they are not perpetually reminded<br/>of their <span style="color: #0000FF;">sensitiveness </span>to cold and <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">"</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">taking </span>cold."<br/>This last group includes those invalided home from<br/>India for malaria and other causes.<br/><br/>Cases of all these ailments have passed satisfactorily under the <span style="color: #0000FF;">writer</span>'s observation during the<br/>last six winters.<br/><br/>But the most important question to try and<br/>solve is what kind of patients ought not to be sent<br/>to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Egypt</span>.<br/><br/>My personal opinion is that all cases of very<br/>advanced or rapidly advancing phthisis of both<br/>lungs <span style="color: #0000FF;">would </span>be better at or near home, unless the<br/>patients themselves express a decided preference<br/>for ending their days in a distant land. The<br/>friends of such patients often need to be reminded<br/>that mere change of climate will not cure the<br/>disease, but that wherever the sick man goes, he<br/>will undoubtedly take his disease with him.<br/><br/>Again, patients with dropsy and all the troublesome <span style="color: #0000FF;">sequelae </span>of heart-disease are surely unwise<br/>to give up all their <span style="color: #0000FF;">home-comforts </span>and surroundings, unless their minds are wholly set upon<br/>going to a certain spot, and it seems cruel to prevent their carrying out the wish of their heart;<br/>but even then it is almost necessary that they<br/>should be accompanied by a trained nurse. A<br/>hot climate is perhaps too exciting for men <span style="color: #0000FF;">with<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
