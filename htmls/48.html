Two miles per hour is usually reckoned "<span style="color: #0000FF;">calm</span>,"<br>five miles is considered "light air," ten miles "light<br>breeze," and 414, which was the maximum <span style="color: #ff0000;">windvelocity </span>during 1888, is called "moderate gale."<br>The khamseen wind is the only bad one in<br>Egypt. It is so called, not because it lasts for<br>fifty days, but because it is liable to occur during<br>the fifty days which follow Easter Monday, and<br>possibly has some connection with the equinoctial<br>gales elsewhere. It blows from the south or <span style="color: #ff0000;">southsouth-east</span>, the more easterly variety being the<br>most disagreeable. It usually continues three days,<br>but may in rare cases last as many as seven days.<br>The number of khamseen days in any one year<br>would seem to vary from four to twenty. We wake<br>in the morning to find a great calm, clouded sky,<br>grey atmosphere, and an invisibly fine sand suspended in the air, which seems to have been<br>caught up from the desert and to be held there<br>until the wind veers again to the north at sunset<br>on the third day, and the air becomes once more<br>clear, cool, and even cold.
