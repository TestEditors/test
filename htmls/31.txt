There is a comfortable hotel, an English doctor, and a railway line<br/>to Ismailia and Cairo, and a fresh-water canal<br/>supplying it from the Nile. Excursions may be<br/>made to the oasis called Moses' Well, to Ataka<br/>mountain, to the sea-coast to collect shells, or to<br/>Suakin.<br/><br/>Suez is in the same latitude as Cairo, and the<br/>Ataka range stretches across the desert to join<br/>Mokattam there.<br/><br/>Naturalists tell us that at Suez begins a genuine<br/>tropical <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea</span>, differing entirely in its inhabitants<br/>from the Mediterranean, only one day's <span style="color: #0000FF;">journey<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
