At other times it is dull and empty,<br/>though two small hotels have lately sprung up,<br/>besides restaurants and many private villas. There<br/>is some talk of building an English hotel near the<br/>plain where, in A.D. 1517, the battle of Heliopolis<br/>made the Turks masters of Egypt, and where<br/>Kleber regained Cairo for a short time in 1800.<br/>The attractions offered to the guests would be<br/>camel-riding in the desert to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh</span>, which was<br/>a suburb built in 1849 to please the Bedouin sheiks<br/>who declined to enter the city of Abbas, the then<br/>Khedive, or to the ostrich-farm and orange-groves<br/>in the neighbourhood.
