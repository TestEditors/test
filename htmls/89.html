Excursions from Cairo. 73<br><br>which we can walk for miles without getting tired.<br>Moreover, our desert is by no means a perfect<br>desert like the Sahara, devoid of vegetation.<br><br>In February, after the <span style="color: #0000FF;">winter </span>rain, green herbs<br>and bushes sprout in the hollows, ravines, and<br>valleys, and the flora are at their finest in March<br>and April. After this the sun becomes too hot<br>for them, and in the summer only the <span style="color: #ff0000;">deeperrooted </span>trees and shrubs remain. The desert thorn<br>is beloved by camels; the <span style="color: #ff0000;">zygophyllums </span>are very<br>common and always succulent, but they are too<br>salt except for the <span style="color: #ff0000;">hungriest </span>camels. The bitter<br><span style="color: #0000FF;">colocynth </span>and senna are used by the Bedouins.<br>The desert flora are by no means rich, but a<br>hundred species can be collected by diligent<br>amateurs, and the number of possible species<br>is <span style="color: #0000FF;">six </span>hundred. Desert plants cannot be cultivated in gardens; but, on the other hand, those<br>species that have found their way from civilized<br>spots into the wilds, seem to thrive untended in<br>the desert. Rabbits, hares, foxes, jerboas, and<br>lizards, all desert-coloured like the camel, are the<br>animals one meets with most often. In the <span style="color: #ff0000;">neigh-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br></span><span style="color: #ff0000;">bourhood </span>of any old necropolis, we find bits of<br>granite and other monuments which have <span style="color: #ff0000;">now<br></span>disappeared; relics of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">flint </span>age may be found<br>by careful searching, and many geological remains,<br>including numerous fragments of petrified wood<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br><br><br><br><br><br></span>
