APPENDIX.<br><br>IN the introductory chapter I have already mentioned in a<br>general way the diseases which are likely to be benefited by<br>wintering in Egypt, and now I propose to consider the<br>question <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>little more in detail, referring only to the most<br>common diseases which I have met with amongst <span style="color: #ff0000;">healthseekers </span>in Cairo.<br><br><span style="color: #0000FF;">J'uh</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">isii.-Commencing</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>with pulmonary consumption, it<br>may be stated that cases of acute tuberculosis or acute<br>phthisis are not sent to Egypt as a rule, because of their<br>rapid fatality and because the state of the patient is so serious<br>as to prevent the desirability of transport. The few patients<br>I have seen with <span style="color: #0000FF;">scrofulous </span>phthisis associated with caries of<br>vertebrae, psoas abscess, or fistula in <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span>, have generally done<br>very well in Cairo, but some of them have died within a<br>few months after leaving for Europe.<br><br>Perhaps I may be allowed here to quote the statistics of<br>the influence of foreign climates in consumption published<br>by Dr. C. T. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Williams</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">'</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>251 cases were <span style="color: #0000FF;">sent </span>to various places<br>in the Riviera, south of Europe, north of Africa, and Atlantic islands. Twenty patients spent twenty-six winters<br>in Egypt, and furnished "by far the finest land result"<br>of the experiment; 65 per cent. improved, 25 per cent.<br>remained stationary, and only 10 per cent. became worse.<br>It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>matter for congratulation that the expense of the<br>trip to Cairo and the ascent of the Nile is now so much<br>reduced that the country is thrown open to large numbers<br><br><span style="color: #ff0000;">L<br><br><br><br><br><br></span>
