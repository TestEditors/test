<span>66 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/>The resources of the Nile have not yet been<br/>developed, and there is but little rowing, sailing,<br/>fishing, or swimming.<br/><br/>Shooting.--<span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Visitor </span>who wants big game will<br/>be disappointed in Egypt; but, on the other hand,<br/>he can get plenty of quail, duck, and snipe. He<br/>must bring an ordinary breech-loading gun with<br/>him, but all cartridges must be bought in Cairo,<br/>one maker having the exclusive monopoly. In<br/>1889 an English visitor rode down and shot three<br/>wolves (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Canis </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">mrirgmus</span>) beyond the Pyramids,<br/>but this is a unique experience. Ibex can be<br/>shot in the mountains near Suez; gazelle are very<br/>shy everywhere; <span style="color: #0000FF;">wild </span>pig can be got in the<br/>Fayoum and at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Broullos</span>, and lynx near <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-elKebir</span>; and in the desert there are jackal, <span style="color: #ff0000;">hyema</span>,<br/>fox, bare, and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">long-cared </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Fennec </span>fox. From<br/>October to March there is good snipe, duck, and<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">goose </span>shooting, and from February to May there<br/>is an abundance of quail. In February, 1889,<br/>two English visitors made a bag of forty duck and<br/>four hundred snipe in five days at Kafr-el-Sheikh,<br/>and this is only an instance of <span style="color: #0000FF;">what </span>many others<br/>have done. One hundred and twenty quail have<br/>been shot by two guns on the road to the Pyramids<br/>in March, between luncheon and dinner. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Pigeonshooting </span>in the villages can be obtained all the<br/>year round, because pigeons are kept for the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sake<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
