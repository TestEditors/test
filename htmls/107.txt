<span>Suburbs of Cairo. <span style="color: #0000FF;">91<br/><br/></span>A druggist is provided by the Government, but<br/>many European visitors prefer to be dependent<br/>upon Cairo for their doctors and drugs.<br/><br/>There are two hotels, the larger of which is in<br/>connection with the baths, and has forty-six bedrooms, some of which are very large, also a <span style="color: #ff0000;">lawntennis </span>court. There is easy telephone and telegraph communication with Cairo.<br/><br/>Furnished and unfurnished villas can be hired<br/>near the Bath Establishment.<br/><br/>Course of baths.--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-- </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>water for the baths has<br/>a temperature of about 86° Fahr. upon coming out<br/>of the spring, and this can be <span style="color: #0000FF;">artificially </span>heated to<br/>102°, or more, in pipes which prevent any evaporation of gas. But it is doubtful whether it is ever<br/>necessary to take the bath above 100°, for hotter<br/>baths are generally apt to exhaust the patient.<br/>The baths are open from 6 <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span>. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>p.111., and<br/>may be taken as it suits the convenience of the<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">patient-say </span>one hour before meals, or three or<br/>four hours after meals. There can be no object<br/>in taking more than one bath in the day, though<br/>robust men <span style="color: #0000FF;">who </span>are in <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>hurry to get through their<br/>course can easily stand an occasional second bath<br/>in the twenty-four hours. The beginner should<br/>not stay in the water longer than fifteen minutes,<br/>but he may gradually increase this to thirty<br/>minutes. If he is not under medical <span style="color: #0000FF;">supervision<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
