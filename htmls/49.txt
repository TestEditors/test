This question is worthy of study, for no<br/>intelligent man can undergo the odd experience of<br/>this wind without being certain that some unusual<br/>electrical disturbance is taking place.<br/><br/>The consideration of the effect of this disturbance<br/>upon invalids is very important, and it may at<br/>once he said that they do not seem to <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffer </span>more<br/>than the rest of the Europeans, and even in many<br/>cases suffer less, because, unlike their more robust<br/>associates, they are not suddenly <span style="color: #0000FF;">debari'ed </span>by the<br/>rapid rise of thermometer from taking active exercise. The fall of temperature at the end of three<br/>days' dry heat is apt to be more dangerous to<br/>imprudent people than the heat itself, for in March<br/>there may be upon these days a fall of 30° Fahr.<br/>at sunset. The general effects of the khamseen<br/>are a little excitement and stimulation of the<br/>system, a more rapid succession of ideas and<br/>increased action of some of the functions, followed<br/>by listlessness, headache, and languor.
