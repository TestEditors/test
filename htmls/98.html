<span>82 Egypt as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Resort.<br/><br/>Behind the town is a cemetery, the south end of<br/>which contains graves of the Eighteenth <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the<br/>Twentieth Dynasties, while the north was used<br/>during the Ptolemaic period. Many Greek and<br/>demotic papyri were found with the <span style="color: #0000FF;">cartonnages </span>of<br/>the mummies, and Boulak is now the proud possessor of two large bronze pans and three wooden<br/>statuettes of the Nineteenth Dynasty.<br/><br/>It is to be regretted that, while so much has been<br/>done by English enterprise, Boulak should have<br/>so few results to show from its own excavations.<br/>Many of the antiquities found pass into the hands<br/>of dealers; and so lately as 1888 several statues<br/>of great value of the Fourth and Fifth Dynasties<br/>were found at Memphis, and had afterwards to be<br/>bought by the Boulak Museum.<br/><br/>14. The cuneiform inscriptions of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Tel-eI-Amarna</span>,<br/>the <span style="color: #0000FF;">necropolis </span>of part of the Eighteenth Dynasty,<br/>half-way between Cairo and Thebes, have lately<br/>been <span style="color: #0000FF;">deciphered </span>by Professor Sayce. From his<br/>unique researches we find that, one hundred years<br/>before the Exodus, active literary intercourse was<br/>going on between Babylon, Egypt, Palestine, and<br/>Syria, and this was carried on by means of the<br/>Babylonian cuneiform writing. He believes that<br/>Babylonian was as much the language of diplomacy and of cultivated society as French has been<br/>in modern times, though it must have taken <span style="color: #ff0000;">years<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
