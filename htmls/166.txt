She gets slight asthma in Alexandria, and is<br/>relieved directly she reaches Cairo.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Of </span>the two cases in which there was no improvement, one<br/>was an English <span style="color: #ff0000;">ofiicer </span>who <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffered </span>at all times and in all<br/>places except when he was on the sea. At Suakin and<br/>Alexandria he was comfortable, but in Cairo <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>was liable to<br/>be laid up once a fortnight, and then had to go a short<br/>yachting cruise to get quite rid of his asthma. The second<br/>case was a very inveterate one, for the lady had been troubled<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">with </span>asthma and occasional bronchitis for more than twenty<br/>years. At Cairo and Luxor she still had asthma every<br/>morning, but in a modified degree. She believed that she<br/>obtained no good from a dry climate, and like the <span style="color: #0000FF;">officer</span>,<br/>she pined for the sea air, and stated that in England,<br/>Brighton was the place where she had least asthma.<br/><br/>It is not <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficult </span>to understand that asthmatic patients<br/>who have immunity from their attacks in damp sea air, may<br/>obtain no relief from dry desert air, and the converse is also<br/>apparently true.<br/><br/>To secure the maximum benefit from the climate of Egypt<br/>it seems to be necessary for asthmatic people to keep in the<br/>same temperature as much as possible, and therefore to avoid<br/>night air. One patient, who had had chronic bronchitis and<br/>asthma for two years, obtained great good from six months<br/>spent in Egypt, and though in the succeeding year and a<br/>half she has had pleurisy, she has had no more bronchitis or<br/>asthma.<br/><br/>Rheumatism in an acute form is practically unknown<br/>among the natives and Europeans in Egypt, but I have seen<br/>two cases among young English patients. One caught cold at<br/>Suez, and had in Cairo her second attack of rheumatic fever;<br/>the other patient had also had a previous attack, and consequent <span style="color: #0000FF;">heart-disease</span>, and caught a chill in Cairo during<br/>the winter. The climate is excellent for all forms of chronic<br/>rheumatism, and for patients convalescing from acute<br/>rheumatism contracted elsewhere.
