<span>Cairo. 27<br/><br/>was <span style="color: #0000FF;">1118</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span>on July 13, while on the night of<br/>January 20, the absolute minimum of <span style="color: #ff0000;">364</span>" was<br/>recorded. In 1887, the highest maximum was<br/>110° on June 9, and the lowest minimum<br/>was 35<span style="color: #0000FF;">" </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Y </span>in January. Freezing-point seems<br/>never to be reached in Cairo; but a shallow dish<br/>of water placed in the wind on the ground in the<br/>desert, may be found occasionally with a thin<br/>coating of ice. I may say here, for the information of those who believe that Cairo is a furnace<br/>in the summer, that the indoor temperature of<br/>rooms on the north side of the house, kept properly shut during the hot hours, need never during<br/>the year exceed 83° Fahr.; and, on the other<br/>hand, that the same rooms, during the depths of<br/>winter, if properly opened to receive the warm<br/>outer air during the day, need never have <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>temperature below 52° Fahr., without employing a<br/>fire<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>By living in sunny south rooms, or by employing artificial heat, the invalid can be certain<br/>all night in the winter of a temperature of <span style="color: #ff0000;">GW'<br/></span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Falw.</span>, or more.<br/><br/>My observations, therefore, correspond with the<br/>results obtained by the Rev<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span>Dr. Barnett in Cairo,<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">which </span>I give in Table II. For nearly two years<br/>he took observations six times daily, from 6 <span style="color: #0000FF;">a.m.<br/></span>to 9 p.m., to ascertain the indoor temperature of<br/>an ordinary house<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
