Moreover, two trains run from<br/>Alexandria to Cairo in three and three-quarter<br/>hours, <span style="color: #0000FF;">while </span>from Ismailia to Cairo there is only<br/>one passenger train in the day, occupying four and<br/>three-quarter hours. At neither port is there any<br/>custom-house difficulty for personal baggage, and<br/>no passport is necessary.<br/><br/>Proposed <span style="color: #0000FF;">itinerary-Delicate </span>patients should<br/>leave Europe at the middle or end of October, so<br/>as to arrive in Cairo early in November. Some<br/>remain in Cairo all the winter; others go up the<br/>Nile to Luxor in December or January, and return<br/>to Cairo at the end of February. In April they<br/>should go to <span style="color: #0000FF;">Ramleh</span>, and thence perhaps to Italy<br/>and the south of France, arranging not to reach<br/>England or other cold climates till the very end of<br/>May<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
