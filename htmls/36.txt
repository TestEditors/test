<span>20 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">pendieular </span>sepia-coloured mud-banks, which vary<br/>slightly in colour, and have occasional thin layers<br/>of drifted sand intervening. Wherever there is no<br/>alluvium, which is of course the only soil in<br/>Egypt, there is sterile desert, and this is the charm<br/>of Luxor, and of the suburbs of Cairo. The Nile<br/>soil is stated to be unlike any other in the world<br/>in composition.<br/><br/>The Royal Society, with the aid of the Royal<br/>Engineer Corps stationed at Cairo, has made several<br/>borings through this soil to the old floor of the Delta.<br/>The mixtures of blown sand and Nile alluvium<br/>were found to continue down to the depth of<br/>121 ft. from the surface, and 95 ft. below the level<br/>of the Mediterranean. At that depth a remarkable change in the deposits took place, and beds<br/>of gravel containing both pebbles and subangular<br/>fragments of quartzite, chert, compact limestone,<br/>with some metamorphic and igneous rocks, were<br/>found, and similar beds occurred at intervals down<br/>to the greatest depth reached. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Up </span>to the present<br/>time no contemporaneous organic remains have<br/>been found in these deposits. The borings near<br/>the Nile at Cairo in 1883 may be briefly summarized thus: For 6 ft. beneath the surface, dry<br/>mould; from 7 ft. to 16 ft., dry sandy mould; from<br/>17 ft. to 38 ft., wet sand; and from 39 ft. to 45 ft.,<br/>wet coarse sand<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
