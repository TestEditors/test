The climate remains as it was then,<br/>but many of the surroundings are changed and<br/>improved, so that patients need no longer fear<br/>absence of civilization or undue <span style="color: #0000FF;">expense </span>I have<br/>tried to avoid writing a <span style="color: #0000FF;">guide-book</span>, and to supply<br/>only that information which cannot be found in<br/>them. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Baedeker</span>'s Guide-book is the best for Cairo<br/>and the Delta, but unfortunately has not been<br/>extended to Upper Egypt. Murray's Handbook was<br/>last published in 1888, but does not contain too<br/>much recent information, and Messrs. Cook have<br/><br/>provided for their clients a very useful <span style="color: #0000FF;">elementary<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
