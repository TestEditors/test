<span>70 Egypt as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Resort.<br/><br/>Visitors interested in Oriental education will like<br/>to see the Polytechnic School, that of the Arts and<br/>Sciences, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>charity for the deaf, dumb, and blind, and<br/>the useful work started by the late Miss Whately.<br/><br/>The ordinary visitor demands at once to be<br/>taken to see the howling and dancing dervishes,<br/>and there are many other more interesting sects<br/>whose monasteries he may <span style="color: #0000FF;">visit </span>if he will. Perhaps<br/>one <span style="color: #ff0000;">may </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>forgiven for reminding him that their<br/>fantastic worship plays to the Mussulman religion<br/>a part something analogous to the Salvation Army<br/>section of the Protestant Church.<br/><br/>But whether the traveller comes for days, weeks,<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>months, let us impress upon him the absolute<br/>duty of <span style="color: #ff0000;">visiting </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Beulah </span>Museum, and of not neglecting his chance of seeing monuments as old as<br/>the Pyramids, wooden statues of much the same<br/>date, a unique assembly of royal mummies and<br/>portraits painted years before the Old Masters.<br/>The great objection to the museum is that most of<br/>the objects are not labelled, and that the catalogue<br/>is atrociously bad. <span style="color: #0000FF;">We </span>may see there the jewellery<br/>worn by an Egyptian queen three thousand six<br/>hundred years ago, a trilingual inscription not<br/>unlike the "Rosetta stone," and tables of kings<br/>like the famous slab from Abydos. The museum<br/>is better than any in Europe, and is rich especially<br/>in monuments of the earliest Dynasties<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
