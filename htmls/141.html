He should rather<br/>consult the Table to see the average heat during<br/>the day out of <span style="color: #0000FF;">doors</span>, and the average cold<br/>of his bedroom by night. During the three<br/>months when some patients are advised to be at<br/>Luxor rather than at <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cairo-December</span>, January,<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">February </span>both the daylight and bedroom temperatures are always above <span style="color: #ff0000;">60Â°</span>, and generally<br/>above <span style="color: #ff0000;">63</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>Fahr. This is the great feature of<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Lusor-a </span>dry warmth during the very months<br/>when it is generally so damp and warm, or damp<br/>and cold, elsewhere. The increase in the mean<br/>daylight temperature of February over that of<br/>January is <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>due to the increase of the daily<br/>maximum, but slightly also to the increased height<br/>of the daily minimum temperature. The remarkable uniformity of the bedroom temperature is<br/>worth noticing, and can be explained as follows.<br/>The walls, it may be remembered, are very thick,<br/>and built of crude bricks, and these, while absorbing a great deal of heat during the day, keep the<br/>extreme heat out of the room; but at night, when<br/>radiation commences, they part with their acquired surplus heat before the bedroom air can<br/>approach the temperature of the external air. By<br/>a little judicious management, opening windows<br/>to catch the sun, and shutting them again <span style="color: #0000FF;">at<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
