Cairo. 59<br><br>Du <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nil</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">12.3.</span>; 50 beds; clients mostly German;<br>is in a bad neighbourhood, but much frequented by<br>artists and others who want to be near the native<br>quarters.<br><br>All the above hotels have taken some pains about<br>sanitary improvements during the last six years,<br>and those which specially desire the English<br>custom are now in fairly good order, but some of<br>the others retain as yet their old system. In none<br>of the above hotels has there been any case of<br>enteric fever arising in Cairo itself during the<br>season of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1888-9</span>. There are, of course, several<br>smaller hotels which I have not here mentioned.<br><br>Pensions.--<span style="color: #ff0000;">-</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>these again there are several, two<br>of which may be mentioned: <span style="color: #ff0000;">Jsinailielt</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">133.</span>; 40<br>beds; three private sitting-rooms; two general<br>sitting-rooms; piano, etc.; baths<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>douches; gymnastic apparatus, <span style="color: #ff0000;">ete</span>.; much frequented by the<br>English. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Content</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">403.</span>; 30 beds.<br><br>Lodgings, furnished and unfurnished, can be<br>obtained during the season, but they are either<br>very expensive or not very good, as all rents are<br>very high in Cairo. Moreover, visitors outside a<br>hotel may find it difficult to have servants who do<br>not talk their language easily.<br><br><span style="color: #0000FF;">Clubs.</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">-There </span>are two excellent clubs, at one of<br>which there are some residential chambers for<br>temporary members<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br><br><br><br><br><br></span>
