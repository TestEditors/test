<span>26 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/>Table I. is a resum√© <span style="color: #ff0000;">svhich </span>I have made from the<br/>records of the five years <span style="color: #0000FF;">1884-88</span>, the monthly<br/>bulletins being printed by the Khedivial Observatory in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abhassiyeh </span>suburb of Cairo.<br/><br/>The observations are taken throughout the day<br/>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">night-at </span>6 a.m., 9 <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span>, noon, 3 p.m., 6 p.m.,<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">9 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m.</span>, and midnight. The barometer used is a<br/>Fortin, verified and <span style="color: #0000FF;">compared </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>Montsouris Observatory in Paris. The readings are reduced to<br/>freezing-point, and are taken at a level of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1082<br/></span>feet above the sea. My table shows that the<br/>variations are not very great, and its practical<br/>value is very little, though, as it falls when the<br/>wind changes to the south, and rises again when<br/>the prevailing north wind blows, it is useful to<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">cheek </span>the probable duration of a khamseen. The<br/>greatest variation during 1888 was 30'2 inches on<br/>one day in March, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">29'4 </span>in. once in February.<br/>The temperatures are taken by a Centigrade thermometer, verified every year, and placed on a<br/>balcony thirty-two feet from the ground, facing<br/>north, and sheltered from the sun. The extremes<br/>of temperature are read daily from self-registering<br/>maximum and minimum instruments. The minimum result is generally found about 6 <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>or a<br/>little earlier, and the daily maximum is invariably<br/>about 2 <span style="color: #ff0000;">13.111. </span>or 3 p.m.<br/><br/>During 1888, the absolute maximum <span style="color: #ff0000;">reached<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
