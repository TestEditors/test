146 Appendix.<br><br>of patients who have hitherto been prevented from coming.<br>Out of 45 cases that I have seen with unmistakable phthisis,<br>69 per cent. improved, 20 per cent. remained stationary, and<br>only 11 per cent. grew worse (including three deaths in<br>Egypt).<br><br>My figures are, therefore, <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmatory </span>of the results<br>previously obtained by Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Williams</span>. The three deaths<br>which occurred in Egypt were cases in the last stage of<br>phthisis, which died soon after arrival, and of course ought<br>not to have been sent abroad. I can only <span style="color: #0000FF;">repeat-what<br></span>every one knows <span style="color: #0000FF;">already-that </span>threatened cases of phthisis,<br>with or without a bad family history, can apparently be<br>prevented from developing in a pure, dry, warm climate;<br>that incipient cases can be improved and perhaps cured; that<br>chronic cases can remain stationary, so that their lives are<br>definitely prolonged; but that advanced cases with disease<br>in both lungs and a temperature every night above the<br>normal cannot be cured by a change of climate, though<br>their disease may, under fortunate circumstances, be arrested,<br>and their days consequently may be enlivened and prolonged.<br><br>Perhaps the most satisfactory case to send abroad is the<br>overgrown boy or girl with winter cough, insufficient expansion of chest, and general <span style="color: #0000FF;">lassitude</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>Such patients require<br>little or no medical treatment, gain weight and breadth of<br>body and mind, and return to their work at home with<br>healthy vigour. Next, if any cases of phthisis are to be<br>sent abroad, they must be either those which, though<br>anatomically advanced, are chronic or quiescent, or those in<br>the earliest possible stage.<br><br>Now, in the case of these latter, the patients and their<br>friends are least likely to think of the scheme, or even to<br>suspect the disease. It therefore rests with the medical<br>attendant, where he thinks fit, to order for his patient a<br>continuance for some months of an equable warm climate,<br>such as is provided by a summer in England, a winter in<br>Egypt, and a second summer in England. <span style="color: #0000FF;">When </span>a <span style="color: #0000FF;">patient<br><br><br><br><br><br></span>
