Cairo. 41<br><br>clothing, though the temperature is often above<br>90° Fahr. for a few hours at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>time.

On May 6 I once saw the exceptional<br>event of a thunder and lightning storm, with hailstones as big as dried peas, and a shade temperature of 85° Fahr. Quail leave Egypt for Europe.<br>Sweet melons and water-melons. Balsam, magnolia, lotus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">jessamine</span>, convolvulus, and passionflowers.<br><br>June, July, <span style="color: #0000FF;">August</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span>are the three hottest<br>months of the year, and in August the climate is<br>already becoming a little damp in consequence of<br>the rising Nile. Rich natives spend these months<br>in Alexandria, Syria, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Constantinople. Europeans in Cairo take a siesta after luncheon.<br>Government <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices </span>are closed at 1 <span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m.</span>, but after<br><span style="color: #0000FF;">4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m. </span>every Englishman goes out to ride, drive,<br>golf, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">lawn-tennis</span>, and the British soldier plays<br>cricket and football. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>nights are always cool,<br>so that it is possible to dine out of doors <span style="color: #0000FF;">without<br><br><br><br><br><br></span>
