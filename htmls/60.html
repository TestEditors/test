<span>44 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/>hottest months of the year,<span style="color: #ff0000;">" </span>diarrhoea being the<br/>most common <span style="color: #0000FF;">certified </span>cause of death. Those<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">11naeauaiuted </span>with the lowest class of Egyptians<br/>can form no idea of the filth in which they voluntarily live, of the habits of the nursing mothers,<br/>and of their indifference to medical aid until the<br/>child is actually dead. The apathy of the people<br/>on this subject is perhaps partly due to the extraordinarily high birth-rate among the natives. The<br/>average <span style="color: #0000FF;">birth-rate </span>in Cairo during the last six<br/>years is <span style="color: #0000FF;">518</span>, and that of Alexandria is 485 per<br/>1000. During 1887 the highest birth-rate recorded<br/>per 1000 among ninety-five other towns publishing<br/>vital statistics <span style="color: #0000FF;">were-Dusseldorf</span>, <span style="color: #ff0000;">39'1</span>; Buenos<br/>Ayres, 39'7; <span style="color: #0000FF;">Chemnitz</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">44'8</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">: </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">While </span>the figures for<br/>Egyptian towns <span style="color: #0000FF;">were-Sues </span>and Ismailia, 54'2;<br/>Cairo, <span style="color: #0000FF;">554</span>; Alexandria, 57'9; and Port Said,<br/>73'7. It is melancholy to reflect that one-third<br/>of the native children die before they have lived<br/>twelve months, and more than one-half of them<br/>die before they have reached the age of five <span style="color: #0000FF;">years<br/></span>It is doubtful whether this extraordinary fecundity<br/>extends itself to European residents in Egypt,<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">whose </span>habits and <span style="color: #0000FF;">laws </span>of divorce are, of course,<br/>entirely different. During my own residence in<br/>Cairo, I have known <span style="color: #0000FF;">thirty</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">five </span>English brides<br/>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">20-35</span>) who have been imported into Egypt; of<br/>these twenty-seven have borne one or more <span style="color: #0000FF;">chil<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
