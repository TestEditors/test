The Cairo Water<br/>Company, which has a complete monopoly for<br/>many years, has lately, under pressure from the<br/>Sanitary Department, made some important improvements in the supply. The intake is <span style="color: #ff0000;">now'<br/></span>from the Nile itself, but used to be from a canal,<br/>which during the summer months was liable to<br/>become stagnant; it has been proposed to remove<br/>the intake some four miles higher up the river,<br/>above all source of contamination. The water is<br/>pumped to the filter-beds at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh</span>, whence,<br/>after filtration, it returns to the town for consumption; all the European quarters are now supplied with filtered water, the daily average being<br/>about 20,000 cubic metres. The velocity of the river<br/>at high <span style="color: #0000FF;">file </span>is about five feet a second, or nearly<br/>three and <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>half miles an hour; but at low Nile,<br/>the velocity is reduced to at least one-fifth of this.<br/>The filter-beds are on raised ground in the<br/>desert, and consist, in the first place, of two huge<br/>tanks, into which the water is always flowing;<br/>from these it is admitted into eight filter-beds,<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">E<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
