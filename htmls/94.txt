Tanis (<span style="color: #0000FF;">San-el-Haggar</span>), twenty miles from<br/>Fakus by boat or donkey, and therefore rather<br/>troublesome to reach. There is an enormous<br/>temple, with statues of different periods from<br/>Twelfth to Nineteenth Dynasties, and it is the<br/>finest place for the tourist to visit till he gets<br/>southward to Thebes. It was excavated by Mariette<br/>and finished by Mr. Petrie, and large numbers of<br/>papyri were sent from it to the British Museum.<br/><br/>4. Tel <span style="color: #ff0000;">Bedowi </span>and Nebesheh stand half-way<br/>from Fakus to Tanis, and have furnished many<br/>gifts to the British Museum. There are still the<br/>temple of Aahmes of the Twenty-sixth Dynasty, a<br/>large shrine of <span style="color: #ff0000;">Umti</span>, and tombs and cemetery.<br/><br/>5. Zagazig (Tel Basta, or the Pibeseth of the<br/>Old Testament). There are records dating from<br/>the Fourth to Thirtieth Dynasties, and from <span style="color: #0000FF;">here<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
