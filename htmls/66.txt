<span>50 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/>each of about 2700 square yards, and after filtration it is received into two closed reservoirs.<br/>The filters are 2 ft. 4 in. deep, and consist of<br/>sand, different sizes of gravel and stones, which<br/>come from the Red Hill at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh</span>, before mentioned. The sand is pure white, from a pit between a pretty stratum of conglomerate travertine<br/>and a lower layer of conglomerate pebble, and is<br/>far removed from all danger arising from the<br/>neighbourhood of old cemeteries. The place for<br/>getting the sand had to be changed two years ago,<br/>because the workmen discovered they were near<br/>the dry osseous remains of an unknown <span style="color: #ff0000;">mediieval<br/></span>burying-place. The sand is all washed before<br/>being used, and the superficial layers of the beds<br/>are removed every four days in the summer, and<br/>every eight days in the winter, when the <span style="color: #0000FF;">watel </span>is<br/>less thick. The deep layers of the beds are only<br/>changed two or three times a year, which is probably not often enough. The beds and plant are<br/>under the constant inspection of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Sanitary'Department</span>, who have also made some interesting<br/>analyses of the filtered Nile water. Table <span style="color: #0000FF;">w.<br/></span>shows the results of twenty-three analyses made<br/>during twelve months, by Mr. F. E. Pollard, F.I.C.,<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">F.G.S.</span>, who has made a speciality of the subject.<br/>The samples were taken in mid-stream, one yard<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">below </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>surface, and about one hundred yards north<br/>of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kasr-el-Nil </span>bridge, near the Company's intake<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
