The existence of<br/>ravines and rounded pebbles must not be taken as<br/>evidence of a great rainfall in prehistoric times,<br/>for even to-day, although there is so little rain in<br/>Cairo, there are sometimes in the hills above Cairo<br/>very heavy torrential storms, which, although the<br/>quantity of rain is not great, sweep down the<br/>valleys and actually cover the neighbouring fields<br/>with a yellow mud and with small pebbles.<br/><br/>Enough has been written to show that the<br/>alluvial soil deposited by the Nile is an entirely<br/>foreign element in the geological formation of<br/>Egypt, and it may be easily studied in the <span style="color: #0000FF;">per<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
