<span>Cairo. 39<br/><br/>Starlings arrive. Oranges and lemons again, as in<br/>all the winter months. Balsam and heliotrope.<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">January</span>--There is often a cold <span style="color: #0000FF;">south </span>wind from<br/>the desert, and though the days are not really cold,<br/>the evenings require a fire indoors and an overcoat abroad. Lung invalids ought not to be out<br/>after sunset. Temperature like the last week of<br/>September in England. Quail return to Upper<br/>Egypt from the Soudan. Roses bloom all the<br/>year round in Cairo, but they are now at their<br/>best. Hyacinth, camellia, mignonette, <span style="color: #0000FF;">ranunculus</span>,<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">cyclamen</span>, verbena, gypsophila, and orange-flowers.<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">February.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Temperature </span>like a dry English<br/>September, chilly at the<span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>beginning of the month,<br/>but warm and pleasant at the end, so that fires<br/>and overcoats are hardly wanted at night. Invalids<br/>return from Luxor to Cairo at the end of February<br/>to escape the south winds, which begin earlier<br/>there. Quail breed in Upper Egypt, and appear<br/>again in Lower Egypt; starlings take their flight.<br/>Oranges, lemons, and loquats. Violets, petunias,<br/>phlox, bougainvillia, and roses.<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">Jlarrlt.-TernperMure </span>is a little like London in<br/>July, but the great feature of this month is the<br/>south wind, which is almost certain to blow at least<br/>twice for two or three days at a time. It is at first<br/>welcomed as a pleasant change after the cold<br/>weather, but soon becomes disagreeable. The <span style="color: #0000FF;">last<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
