<span>Appendix. 147<br/><br/>in whom phthisis is suspected goes or is taken by his relatives<br/>to a doctor to have his chest examined, it may generally be<br/>prophesied either that there is no ground for uneasiness, or<br/>that the disease has already made distinct progress. Incipient<br/>cases which gain weight and improve in other respects<br/>during a winter abroad, often need to be reminded that the<br/>measure should be repeated <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>second time.<br/><br/>Popular young patients must often be banished from Cairo<br/>during December and January, to desert life at the Pyramids,<br/>or at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Lusor</span>, to protect them from themselves and their<br/>acquaintance, and the snares of evening engagements.<br/><br/>Chronic cases of undoubted phthisis do very well in Egypt,<br/>for they improve in general health, digestion, and appetite,<br/>and can often take <span style="color: #0000FF;">cod-liver </span>oil, which was previously impossible. They are encouraged by finding that they gain a<br/>little weight, and become rid of troublesome cough and<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">expectomtion</span>. This last symptom is an important one in<br/>Egypt, and one of the first signs of the patient's improvement.<br/><br/>An ordinary <span style="color: #0000FF;">phthisical </span>individual complains, when he first<br/>reaches Cairo, of cough and expectoration, and the stethoscope<br/>reveals a multitude of large and small moist sounds. When<br/>he is seen again a fortnight later, these sounds have partly<br/>disappeared, he still coughs, but is surprised and sometimes<br/>alarmed to notice that the <span style="color: #ff0000;">expectoratior1 </span>has suddenly<br/>diminished. After another week or two, he reports that he<br/>only expectorates the first thing in the morning; he seldom<br/>coughs during the day, and the stethoscope again confirms<br/>the drying-up process which is going on in the lung, which<br/>seems to be the direct result of dry air inhaled. This is not<br/>so wonderful when we remember that <span style="color: #0000FF;">the </span>average winter<br/>humidity of the Cairo air is under <span style="color: #0000FF;">sixty-six </span>per cent. (Table<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">L</span>), while that of London is above ninety per cent. It would<br/>be interesting to know whether the very dry air is <span style="color: #0000FF;">inimical<br/></span>to the life and development of the tubercle bacillus. Two<br/>cases in which bacilli were seen in London and on arrival<br/>in Cairo, and could not <span style="color: #ff0000;">be </span>found before leaving Cairo <span style="color: #0000FF;">and<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
