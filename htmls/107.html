Suburbs of Cairo. <span style="color: #0000FF;">91<br><br></span>A druggist is provided by the Government, but<br>many European visitors prefer to be dependent<br>upon Cairo for their doctors and drugs.<br><br>There are two hotels, the larger of which is in<br>connection with the baths, and has forty-six bedrooms, some of which are very large, also a <span style="color: #ff0000;">lawntennis </span>court.

But it is doubtful whether it is ever<br>necessary to take the bath above 100°, for hotter<br>baths are generally apt to exhaust the patient.<br>The baths are open from 6 <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span>. to <span style="color: #0000FF;">S </span>p.111., and<br>may be taken as it suits the convenience of the<br><span style="color: #0000FF;">patient-say </span>one hour before meals, or three or<br>four hours after meals.
