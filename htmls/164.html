148 Appendix<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br><br></span>upon returning to London, are possibly confirmatory of this<br>suspicion.<br><br>Advanced cases of phthisis will often be much happier<br>leading an indoor life in their own unsuitable climate than<br>an occasional outdoor life in a more favourable one. This is<br>especially the case if the patient has very limited means.<br>He gains sunlight and <span style="color: #ff0000;">sunhoat </span>during the day, and runs <span style="color: #0000FF;">a<br></span>chance of his disease being arrested; but against this he<br>must balance draughts and irksome travelling, a paucity of<br>fireplaces, food and habits to which he is unsuited, and exile<br>from his home-comforts and best friends.<br><br>I have previously referred to the question as to whether it<br>is advisable or not to send cases of haemorrhagic phthisis to<br>Cairo. I have not yet seen any ill result from doing so, and<br>though I do not wish here to quote medical cases, I will give<br>the results of the only two patients I have met, with <span style="color: #0000FF;">alarming </span>history of recent haemoptysis. The first case, a friend,<br>but not a patient of mine, aged 27, had copious <span style="color: #0000FF;">haemoptysis</span>,<br>recurring several times, followed by cough, purulent sputa,<br><span style="color: #0000FF;">dyspnea</span>, and loss of weight (<span style="color: #0000FF;">171</span>, lbs.). <span style="color: #ff0000;">Be </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">Was </span>sent to Pau,<br>Nice, Mont Dore, and eventually to Egypt. He was so<br>weak that he had to be carried ashore at Suez, and he could<br>not walk for more than ten minutes at a time. After six<br>weeks in Cairo, he went to Luxor for two months in January,<br>1888. In March his cough and expectoration had quite<br>ceased, and he could be out shooting for three hours at a<br>time. He gained <span style="color: #0000FF;">191 </span>lbs. weight while in Egypt, and spent<br>the following winter at Cairo and Luxor, without cough,<br>expectoration, <span style="color: #ff0000;">OT </span>haemoptysis, but still with old physical<br>signs at the right apex.<br><br>The second case was that of a lady, aged 19, whose father,<br>brother, and sister, had all died of rapid phthisis with<br><span style="color: #0000FF;">haemoptysis</span>. She herself had had haemoptysis for a year,<br>with loss of flesh, night sweats, slight cough, and signs of<br>incipient disease <span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>one apex. After fifteen weeks at Cairo,<br>she had gained <span style="color: #0000FF;">151135. </span>weight, and there was general <span style="color: #0000FF;">improve<br><br><br><br><br></span>
