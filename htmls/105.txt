<span>Suburbs of Cairo. 89<br/><br/>but various fires have destroyed all trace of former<br/>dwellings. There remain, however, for those who<br/>dig, the <span style="color: #0000FF;">debris </span>of bricks, granite, marble, pottery,<br/>glass, and even coins.<br/><br/>After the records of Arab historians we come<br/>down to 1830, when <span style="color: #0000FF;">Linant </span>Pasha, a French<br/>engineer, discovered that the region of sulphur<br/>springs extended southward from Helouan to<br/>opposite <span style="color: #ff0000;">Benisuef</span>, where borings used to be made<br/>by the natives, who bathed in the springs and built<br/>tents near them. In 1819 the Egyptian Government took possession of Helouan, built wooden<br/>huts, and even sent sick soldiers to be experimented<br/>on by the waters. The results were so satisfactory<br/>that the spot began to be a little popular, but it<br/>was not until 1871 that the Government could<br/>make up its mind either to work the springs itself<br/>or to let them to an intelligent European. In<br/>that year a Dr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Reil </span>was appointed Director<br/>of the Baths, a small town began gradually to<br/>spring up, and in 1873 the Grand Hotel was<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">built </span>and was <span style="color: #0000FF;">confided </span>to its present manager.<br/>Trees were planted, the swamps were drained,<br/>and in 1876 a railway from Cairo was opened.<br/>Great improvements have been made to the baths,<br/>and the place is every year becoming more popular,<br/>the number of baths during 1885 having been only<br/>7031, and being new doubled every year<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
