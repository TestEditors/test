<span>Voyage up the Nile. 109<br/><br/>get quickly and inexpensively <span style="color: #0000FF;">to </span>the hotels at<br/>Luxor. Special facilities are made <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>route for<br/>postal and telegraphic communication with Cairo<br/>and with Europe.<br/><br/>Messrs. Cook are always able to provide families<br/>or <span style="color: #0000FF;">shooting-parties </span>with <span style="color: #ff0000;">dahabiyehs </span>and competent<br/>dragomans, or these may be engaged from many<br/>native owners.<br/><br/>The voyage up the Nile was formerly reserved<br/>for the richest English and Americans, but I have<br/>shown that it is now made easy for any one who<br/>wishes to spend £100 in pursuit of health or<br/>pleasure. There are many who are not sufficiently<br/>gregarious to wish to make a pleasure-trip with a<br/>number of strangers, and to see the sights at<br/>a fixed time and within a fixed period, and, moreover, have not to consider the economy of time or<br/>money. To them the peaceful life of <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>dahabiyeh<br/>has many attractions: their party is complete in<br/>itself<span style="color: #ff0000;">, </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">- </span>they have a supply of books, <span style="color: #ff0000;">sketchingmaterials</span>, shooting necessaries and patience; and<br/>a dragoman who will procure for them every day a<br/>fresh supply of milk, meat, vegetables, fruit,<br/>poultry, and eggs. They will be dependent on<br/>their cook for bread, and on various tins for butter,<br/>jam, bacon, biscuits, etc. <span style="color: #0000FF;">They </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">had </span>better provide<br/>their own wine, curtains for <span style="color: #ff0000;">dmughty </span>windows,<br/>and <span style="color: #0000FF;">deck-chairs</span>. They may either start in <span style="color: #0000FF;">their<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
