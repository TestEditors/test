<span>Cairo. 41<br/><br/>clothing, though the temperature is often above<br/>90° Fahr. for a few hours at <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>time. Invalids<br/>leave for Ramleh, or for Italy and the south of<br/>France. Strawberries and apricots. Oleander,<br/>pelargonium, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">Sunflowers</span>.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Jfay.</span>--We are still liable to occasional khamseen winds, and each week the weather is becoming<br/>warmer; but Cairo is now very lovely; the trees in<br/>the streets have their new foliage, and the gardens<br/>are bright with many subtropical flowering trees<br/>and shrubs. On May 6 I once saw the exceptional<br/>event of a thunder and lightning storm, with hailstones as big as dried peas, and a shade temperature of 85° Fahr. Quail leave Egypt for Europe.<br/>Sweet melons and water-melons. Balsam, magnolia, lotus, <span style="color: #0000FF;">jessamine</span>, convolvulus, and passionflowers.<br/><br/>June, July, <span style="color: #0000FF;">August</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">These </span>are the three hottest<br/>months of the year, and in August the climate is<br/>already becoming a little damp in consequence of<br/>the rising Nile. Rich natives spend these months<br/>in Alexandria, Syria, <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>Constantinople. Europeans in Cairo take a siesta after luncheon.<br/>Government <span style="color: #0000FF;">offices </span>are closed at 1 <span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m.</span>, but after<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">4 </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">p.m. </span>every Englishman goes out to ride, drive,<br/>golf, or <span style="color: #0000FF;">lawn-tennis</span>, and the British soldier plays<br/>cricket and football. <span style="color: #0000FF;">The </span>nights are always cool,<br/>so that it is possible to dine out of doors <span style="color: #0000FF;">without<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
