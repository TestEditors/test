This is a very delightful way of travelling,<br/>but the number of tow steamers is limited, and the<br/>price often prohibitive. The ordinary dahabiyeh,<br/>in going up stream against a current of three miles<br/>an hour, is quite dependent on wind. Fortunately<br/>the prevailing wind is from the north, the sails<br/>are large, and the crew are clever to take all<br/>advantage of it. It will take about two months to<br/>get to the First Cataract and back, and three<br/>months to go from Cairo to the Second Cataract<br/>and back, and the cost for a party of four is about<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">twenty-five </span>shillings per head per day.<br/><br/>There ought to be no mosquitoes on the Nile, or<br/>other biting insects, but flies are often a great<br/>trouble, and require Whisks, papers, and traps.
