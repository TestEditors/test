<span>38 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/>Cairo after the middle of the month, because the<br/>summer is then rather suddenly at an end, and<br/>winter clothing is issued to the troops. But the<br/>proportion of heat to dampness is still great,<br/>mosquitoes are rampant, and invalids are not<br/>advised to arrive till the last days<span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>of the month<br/>at the very earliest. Quail are already in Upper<br/>Egypt, and snipe, ducks, and geese are arriving.<br/>Fresh dates are at their best, grapes, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">eustardapples</span>. Bananas have begun, and continue all the<br/>winter. Among flowers there are dahlia, Zinnia,<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">periwinkle</span>, and tuberoses.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">November.</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">A </span>beautiful month for invalids to<br/>arrive, and before the crush of pleasure-seekers,<br/>so that good rooms can be easily secured. The<br/>Nile inundation is still out between the town and<br/>the Pyramids, and the sunsets are perhaps more<br/>beautiful <span style="color: #0000FF;">than </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">at </span>any other time of year. Weather<br/>no longer too hot for outdoor exercise. Mosquitoes<br/>disappearing, though nets are always wanted at<br/>night throughout the year, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">fir-skinned<br/></span>strangers suffer until they become <span style="color: #ff0000;">aeelimUized</span>.<br/>Oranges and lemons. Chrysanthemums and lovely<br/>pointsettia shrubs.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Decembor.</span>--At the end of the month we are<br/>liable to a little cloud and rain, and invalids who<br/>want to avoid all cold damp should go up to Luxor.<br/>Temperature like a dry September in England<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
