<span>16 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/>north of it. Hermit crabs and very many others<br/>of the crab family, bivalves and univalves, starshaped egg-urchins (Echinometra lucunter), crustaceans, sponges, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">coral</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">--</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">fish</span>, with many scores<br/>of others, can be found by exploring the coast and<br/>rocky pools.<br/><br/>By means of a boat on a clear day, a visit to the<br/>coral reefs may be made, though the best coral is<br/>at some distance from Suez. Dark brown and<br/>yellowish green coral in loose and brittle bits is<br/>based here on massive rocks of black mesh coral<br/>(Porites), and more rarely there may be found the<br/>cherry-red cup-star variety (<span style="color: #0000FF;">Pocillopora</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">) </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">-not </span>to<br/>be confounded with the ordinary red coral, which<br/>is not found here.<br/><br/>The strange and wonderful fishes can be best<br/>seen by going to the market, no less than five<br/>hundred and twenty kinds which haunt the coral<br/>slopes being known. One often offered for sale is<br/>the ball-fish (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Tetredon</span>), which has the power of<br/>blowing itself up like a balloon and floating on<br/>the water on its back; this, like the urchin-fish<br/>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">Diodon</span>), is protected like a hedgehog on land by<br/>spiny prickles, beside a beak something like a<br/>parrot's. They can bite well with their beaks, but<br/>are not poisonous. Small sharks are occasionally<br/>heard of, leaping and flying-fish, and the gay parrot<br/>and rainbow fishes are also known<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
