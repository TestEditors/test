<span>18 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/>little marl and clay and fragments of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Terebratula</span>,<br/>Ostrea, <span style="color: #ff0000;">Peetea</span>, and Balanus, all considerably later<br/>than the Eocene period, and tending to show that<br/>there was once another <span style="color: #0000FF;">sea </span>margin 220 feet above<br/>the Mediterranean and Red Sea. Near the<br/>Pyramids again are raised beaches, limestone<br/>pierced by Pholades and Ostrea <span style="color: #0000FF;">undulata</span>; and two<br/>miles south of the Sphinx are fossil <span style="color: #ff0000;">sen-urchins<br/></span>(Clypeaster Egyptiacus), <span style="color: #0000FF;">oyster-shells </span>and pectens<br/>(<span style="color: #0000FF;">? </span>Post-Pliocene). The geological map shows<br/>alluvial deposit everywhere in the Delta and along<br/>the banks of the Nile, while to both east and west<br/>of this near Cairo is nummulite limestone, and to<br/>the north-east of Cairo are sandhills in the desert<br/>stretching down to the Suez Canal. The incomparably dry pure air of Cairo and Upper Egypt<br/>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">clue </span>to this same nummulite limestone desert,<br/>which for miles and miles acts as a great lung of<br/>nature and purifies all the air which blows across<br/>it, while the extraordinary fertility of Lower Egypt<br/>is <span style="color: #ff0000;">caused </span>by the alluvial deposit. The absence<br/>of vegetation and of <span style="color: #ff0000;">moistdirfin </span>the desert has<br/>left its characters almost unaltered for ages, though<br/>there is abundant evidence of mountain torrents<br/>in prehistoric times and in the present day.<br/><br/>Lower Egypt consists geologically, therefore, of(1) Nummulite limestone of the Eocene period,<br/>stretching southwards in the desert from <span style="color: #ff0000;">Cairo<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
