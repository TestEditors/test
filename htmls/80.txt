Many of<br/>the trees have now been labelled, and among them<br/>may be found the Norfolk Island pine, Indian<br/>beech, Yucca gloriosa, twenty different kinds of<br/>figs, the India horse-chestnut, the Acacia <span style="color: #0000FF;">farnesiana</span>,<br/>and towering indiarubber trees. Then one sees<br/>also tropical sedge, <span style="color: #0000FF;">Oleander-s </span>which are bright<br/>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">all </span>colours in April and May, and many<br/>commoner varieties too numerous to mention.<br/>Here and there in the garden are solitary giants<br/>of the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Albizzia </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">lebbek</span>, which was introduced into<br/>Egypt one hundred and fifty years ago, and, besides<br/>making beautiful avenues in Cairo, has now spread<br/>all over the country. It grows with great rapidity<br/>and with extraordinary ease, and requires no watering after the first few years. Unfortunately it has<br/>lately been attacked by the larva of a beetle, and<br/>some of the oldest trees have died in consequence.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Flora-Almost </span>the only strictly indigenous<br/>trees in Egypt are the tamarisk, the sunt (Acacia<br/>Nilotica), and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">sycamore-fig</span>, but the flora<br/>consist of about 1400 specimens. Among the<br/>many successfully introduced trees is the Jerusalem<br/>thorn (Parkinsonia <span style="color: #0000FF;">aculeata</span>), which flourishes<br/>especially in the desert at <span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh </span>and Helouan.<br/>The lotus is found in Cairo in the spring, but <span style="color: #0000FF;">is<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
