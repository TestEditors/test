<span>Voyage up the Nile. 111<br/><br/>In <span style="color: #0000FF;">November</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">,</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">' </span>between Cairo and <span style="color: #0000FF;">Assiout </span>the<br/>deck temperature varies from 53° at 7 a.m. to 63°<br/>at noon and to <span style="color: #0000FF;">580 </span>after sunset, which is also the<br/>mean of the month. The wind is north to northeast; there is a little dew at night, and a warmer<br/>coat is necessary on deck after sunset. The<br/>saloon temperature of November varies from 55°<br/>to 72°, with an average of <span style="color: #0000FF;">66°</span>.<br/><br/>In December, Patterson gives as the result of<br/>two years' observations (<span style="color: #0000FF;">1800-1-2</span>) <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>minimum on<br/>deck of <span style="color: #ff0000;">47</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>, <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>maximum of 685°, and a mean of<br/>57°. The range is greater, so that once <span style="color: #0000FF;">on<br/></span>December 29, the morning observation was 52°,<br/>and at midday 72°. The saloon temperatures of<br/>another observer give a minimum of 17°<span style="color: #ff0000;">; </span>maximum,<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">79°</span>; and mean, 63°; and his results of <span style="color: #0000FF;">ninety-three<br/></span><span style="color: #0000FF;">psychrometrical </span>readings give as average humidity<br/>in 1888, in the dahabiyeh saloon, <span style="color: #ff0000;">50 </span>per <span style="color: #0000FF;">cent</span>,<br/>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">a </span>range from 43 to 78. The thermometer is<br/>highest at 3 <span style="color: #ff0000;">p.111</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">. </span>and lowest between midnight<br/>and 7 <span style="color: #0000FF;">am</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span>The air is driest in the afternoon,<br/>and <span style="color: #ff0000;">dampest </span>in the early morning. Dr. F. S.<br/>Worthington has also given me some careful daily<br/>readings for December, 1888, between Cairo and a<br/>few miles to its south. The barometer average<br/>(corrected for sea-level) was 3019; in the <span style="color: #ff0000;">dnhnbiyeh </span>saloon the average maximum temperature<br/><br/>* Average of three observers<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
