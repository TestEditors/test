<span>34 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">venienced </span>by not being able to pursue their ordinary outdoor life, and those whose work does not<br/>permit of their resting feel fagged and tired before<br/>the close of the day. The effect on natives would<br/>seem to be something similar, the street-occupants<br/>lying about in all positions on the paths, instead<br/>of sitting and chattering as on other days. Fever<br/>patients in bed do not seem to be conscious of the<br/>change to khamseen weather. Bronchitic and<br/>phthisical individuals are rather benefited than<br/>otherwise by the dry, warm air; but it is doubtful<br/>whether the air would not be too stimulating for<br/>those with a tendency to <span style="color: #0000FF;">haemoptysis</span>.<br/><br/>My only experience <span style="color: #0000FF;">on </span>this point is derived from<br/>one young Englishwoman, whose expectoration in<br/>March became a little bloody. She liked the<br/>khamseen days; but I thought it prudent to send<br/>her to Ramleh, <span style="color: #0000FF;">chiefly </span>because she had a very bad<br/>family history of haemoptysis. A bad khamseen,<br/>besides its effects on the human race, shrivels up<br/>roses and other flowers, and will even warp and<br/>crack unseasoned wood. It is <span style="color: #0000FF;">curious </span>that the<br/>same southerly wind, so hot in March and April,<br/>is occasionally in winter the coldest that blows,<br/>the difference being that then the sun's rays<br/>fall more obliquely on the desert, and the wind<br/>is chilled by its passage over the mountains of<br/>Abyssinia<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
