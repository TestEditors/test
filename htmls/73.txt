<span>Cairo. 57<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">confidently </span>hoped that money may at once <span style="color: #ff0000;">be<br/></span>found for carrying out these reforms.<br/><br/>Until then individuals must continue to protect<br/>themselves by cutting off all communication with<br/>the ground, and by carefully trapping and ventilating all pipes.<br/><br/>In the mean time, all <span style="color: #0000FF;">street-sewers </span>have been<br/>blocked and destroyed, because they are unnecessary for storm water, and because it was found<br/>that house proprietors used them as overflows for<br/>their cesspools, and thus vitiated the fresh air of<br/>the streets. At the same time some <span style="color: #ff0000;">gnspipes</span>, which<br/>were too small, made of zinc, and allowed leakage<br/>in the surrounding earth, and consequent odour,<br/>have been removed, and replaced by six-inch iron<br/>pipes, which are a great improvement. All cesspools are now prevented from draining into the<br/>Nile or canals, and are obliged to be emptied at<br/>least every six months, those of the cemented type<br/>of course requiring to be emptied much oftener.<br/>The sewage is taken in patent shut carts to<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">Abbassiyeh </span>desert by night, at the rate of over <span style="color: #ff0000;">30,000<br/></span>tons a year. There it is deodorized and sifted, and<br/>sold to the <span style="color: #0000FF;">fellaheen </span>as "<span style="color: #ff0000;">u </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">£2'a </span>ton<br/>for use on their lands. These changes, though not<br/>nearly radical enough, have already contributed<br/>greatly to the comfort and health of the European<br/>inhabitants<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
