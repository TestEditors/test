<span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Alexandria-Rama</span>. 135<br/><br/>smaller ones, three or four "pensions," and a<br/>dozen lodging-houses, two clubs, three theatres,<br/>and streets of European shops. Very little trace<br/>of the bombardment and fire of 1882 remains, and<br/>since £4,000,000 of indemnity were paid by the<br/>Egyptian Government, building has been stimulated to such an extent that there are many <span style="color: #ff0000;">now<br/></span>houses and shops which cannot find a tenant.<br/><br/>Among medical men there is a well-known<br/>Scotchman, who with his assistants has for three<br/>decades administered to the wants of the British<br/>colony, and he has <span style="color: #0000FF;">as </span>colleagues a dozen Europeans<br/>of the first rank, besides an American dentist and<br/>two oculists. There are three druggists commanding <span style="color: #0000FF;">confidence</span>, three trained English nurses for<br/>private cases at their own homes, and three excellent European hospitals where private patients<br/>are received.<br/><br/>The water-supply of the town is excellent, and is<br/>in the hands of an English company, which has a<br/>monopoly for ever, and is represented on the spot<br/>by an energetic and highly intelligent English<br/>civil engineer. The water is obtained from the<br/>Mahmoudieh canal, which branches off the Nile at<br/>Atfeh; but if, during low Nile, there is any danger<br/>of the river at Atfeh becoming brackish, the supply<br/>is taken from higher up the Nile near Cairo. The<br/>banks of the canal are inspected by watchmen, <span style="color: #0000FF;">to<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
