<span>126 Egypt as a <span style="color: #0000FF;">Winter </span>Resort.<br/><br/>sunset, the invalid can easily avoid all cold air,<br/>and the risks of a sudden drop of the thermometer.<br/>In March it will often be necessary to pursue the<br/>opposite tactics, and shut windows during the<br/>greatest heat of the day, to keep the bedroom from<br/>getting too hot. This was not done in March,<br/>1878, and consequently the bedroom average<br/>jumped up to over <span style="color: #ff0000;">77</span><span style="color: #ff0000;">"</span>. Dr. Maclean made some<br/>further experiments, to show that the lowest temperature in the bedroom was usually 20° higher<br/>than the lowest temperature in the shade, and<br/>that a low bedroom heat depends chiefly on the<br/>presence of a low shade minimum.<br/><br/>The daily range of the thermometer is always<br/>very great, as one would expect in an inland dry<br/>country of the latitude of Luxor. The temperature falls at night, in consequence of the rapid<br/>radiation of heat which obtains under a cloudless<br/>sky. But the range of maximum heat from one<br/>day to another, for the first three months of the<br/>year, is <span style="color: #0000FF;">3'1</span>", showing that during the<br/>portion of the twenty-four hours available for<br/>the invalid the climate is remarkably equal.<br/><br/>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">humidity </span>is a good deal lower than that of<br/>Cairo, being 16'5 per cent. less in January, 15 less<br/>in February, and 11 less in March. The extremes<br/>in January, 1878, at Luxor, were 74 and 33; in<br/>February, 67 and 27; and in March the <span style="color: #0000FF;">maximum<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
