<span>Excursions from Cairo. 77<br/><br/>monumental wonders are <span style="color: #ff0000;">suffieientiy </span>set forth in<br/>the guide-books; but some of them are kept purposely buried in the sand to prevent destruction.<br/>It is usually said that the mummied bulls from<br/>the Apis Mausoleum are all lost, but the writer<br/>accidentally found three of <span style="color: #0000FF;">them </span>in 1887 in the<br/>Historical <span style="color: #0000FF;">Society</span>'s Museum in New York. They<br/>were probably stolen and bought when the Serapeum was discovered in 1861. The tomb of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Till</span>, of<br/>the Fifth Dynasty, contains wall sculptures in such<br/>excellent preservation that it should be <span style="color: #ff0000;">visited </span>by<br/>all; and there is another tomb kept closed which<br/>is by no means inferior. From these <span style="color: #0000FF;">life-like<br/></span>sculptures and others much has been learnt about<br/>the manners and customs of those who lived more<br/>than five thousand years ago.<br/><br/>Recent discoveries in <span style="color: #ff0000;">Eyyptt</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">Full </span>accounts of<br/>the late discoveries of Mr. Flinders Petrie, and<br/>of Mr. Naville for the Egyptian Exploration Fund,<br/>have been published in their special transactions,<br/>but not yet in the guide-books, so the remainder of<br/>this chapter will be devoted to recapitulating them<br/>for the benefit of travellers who desire to visit the<br/>spots which have been worked during the English<br/>occupation.<br/><br/>1. Commencing with Lower Egypt, we have<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">* </span>Mr. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Petrie </span>has kindly supplied me with much valuable information for this purpose<span style="color: #ff0000;">.<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
