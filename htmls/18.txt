<span>2 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/>civilization which have attended the efforts of her<br/>officials on the spot, and the improved facilities<br/>for travelling obtained by Messrs. Cook, have all<br/>tended to make Cairo and the Nile a very favourite<br/>winter resort. Some six thousand visitors come to<br/>Cairo during the winter months, and of <span style="color: #ff0000;">these </span>about<br/>twelve hundred proceed up the Nile in steamer or<br/>in dahabiyeh. To show that the climate deals<br/>fairly with these masses of visitors, it may be<br/>mentioned that the writer, in a medical experience<br/>of six winters, has lost only two patients who came<br/>to Egypt for their health. Both these were<br/>patients far advanced in consumption, who ought<br/>never to have left their homes, one an Australian,<br/>who reached Cairo at the beginning of 1888, and<br/>died there in February; the other, an American,<br/>who died in December, 1888, a few hours after<br/>reaching Cairo. This experience is not only a<br/>personal one, for the death register shows that<br/>there have been only nine deaths among British<br/>visitors in Cairo during the <span style="color: #0000FF;">gig </span>years ending June,<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">1880</span>. Of these nine, seven arrived here ill of<br/>incurable diseases; the eighth was thought to be<br/>robust, but died of <span style="color: #0000FF;">uraemic </span>poisoning during her<br/>first week in Cairo; and the ninth caught a chill<br/>while out sketching, and died of double pneumonia.<br/>But the writer's object is not to try and prove<br/>that Egypt is the best health-resort in the world<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
