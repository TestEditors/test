The cases which do not improve much are often<br/>those who will not stay indoors after twilight, and expose<br/>themselves to cold and damp during December and January.<br/><br/>I have seen considerable improvement in some cases of<br/>laryngeal phthisis, but more in the general state than locally.<br/>Most of the cases of advanced phthisis which have grown<br/>worse in Egypt have been complicated with chronic diarrhoea.<br/>There are several apparently healthy residents now in Cairo<br/>who originally came there from Europe for their health,<br/>some of them having had <span style="color: #0000FF;">haemoptysis </span>and other lung<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">symptoms<br/><br/></span>Chronic <span style="color: #0000FF;">bronchitis</span>--A good many <span style="color: #ff0000;">emphysemntons </span>patients<br/>come to Cairo every winter, because they find they can get<br/>through the cold months with less cough, less <span style="color: #0000FF;">discomfort</span>,<br/>and far less <span style="color: #0000FF;">confinement</span>. Those whose bronchial tubes are<br/>irritated by the fine dust in the air on <span style="color: #0000FF;">sand-storm </span>days must<br/>then remain shut up in their houses, just as they would to<br/>avoid fog, rain, and east wind elsewhere.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Asthma.</span>--<span style="color: #0000FF;">All </span>the cases that I have seen in Egypt have<br/>improved and done well, excepting two. Several former<br/>asthmatic patients have settled down as residents in the<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">country</span>, and one English lady, who has had dry <span style="color: #0000FF;">asthma </span>for<br/>twenty <span style="color: #0000FF;">yours</span>, comes every year to Cairo and the Nile because<br/>she is quite well there. Her brother and other relations<br/>suffer from asthma, and she herself can live happily in<br/>London, but in no other part of England that she has yet<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">LO<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
