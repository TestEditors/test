<span>Cairo. 53<br/><br/>undergone concentration by evaporation, besides<br/>having washed the lower strata, from which it<br/>extracts chlorine.<br/><br/>As a <span style="color: #0000FF;">confirmation </span>of this, we see that the<br/>chlorine is at its maximum just before the annual<br/>flood.<br/><br/>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">deficiency </span>of nitrates is interesting, but does<br/>not necessarily show an absence of defilement. The<br/>softness of the water makes it very agreeable for<br/>all domestic purposes; the slight variation in hardness is due to carbonate of lime, through which<br/>the river has cut its way. The analyses of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1888-0<br/></span>showed a trace of iron, but of no poisonous metals,<br/>and no nitrites, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIeisch</span>'s sewage test never<br/>gave the slightest evidence of sewage contamination.<br/><br/>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfiltered </span>water should never be drunk by<br/>visitors <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>residents, though the natives prefer it<br/>infinitely. Some imprudent tourists drink it from<br/>the dirty porous jars of the villagers, and must not<br/>wonder at <span style="color: #0000FF;">suffering </span>occasionally in consequence.<br/><br/>The suspended matter, which is the chief fertilizing ingredient of the Nile, varies in quantity in<br/>the most wonderful way. Mr. Pollard's figures<br/>vary from'9 in July, to <span style="color: #0000FF;">1618 </span>in September,<br/>while Dr. Letheby found <span style="color: #0000FF;">33 </span>in May, 1875, and<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">1044 </span>grains in August, 1874. The fertility of the<br/>flood, besides the clay, is due to the organic matter<span style="color: #ff0000;">,<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
