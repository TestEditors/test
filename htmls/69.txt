The<br/>softness of the water makes it very agreeable for<br/>all domestic purposes; the slight variation in hardness is due to carbonate of lime, through which<br/>the river has cut its way. The analyses of <span style="color: #0000FF;">1888-0<br/></span>showed a trace of iron, but of no poisonous metals,<br/>and no nitrites, and <span style="color: #ff0000;">IIeisch</span>'s sewage test never<br/>gave the slightest evidence of sewage contamination.<br/><br/>The <span style="color: #0000FF;">unfiltered </span>water should never be drunk by<br/>visitors <span style="color: #0000FF;">or </span>residents, though the natives prefer it<br/>infinitely.
