An English medical man is<br/>resident during the season, and his colleagues in<br/>Cairo can also be summoned by telephone or<br/>donkey-messenger. Among other things provided<br/>for the comfort of English visitors are a <span style="color: #ff0000;">steamlaundry</span>, smoking-rooms, magazines and newspapers, and stabling for thirty-two horses. For<br/>amusements there are an archery ground and<br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">lawn-tennis </span>court, golf-links, and the makings of<br/>a polo and cricket ground.

It is also very useful<br/>for those in Cairo who wish to drive out for luncheon<br/>or afternoon tea in the winter, or for dinner upon<br/>moonlit nights in the warmer weather. The air<br/>is so pure and dry that it cannot be praised too<br/>highly, but it must be remembered that of the<br/>three desert spots recommended near Cairo, none<br/>are so warm as Luxor; but, on the other hand,<br/>they are invaluable to those who do not want the<br/>fatigue and expense of a voyage up the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Nile</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">. </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">The<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
