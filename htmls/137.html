Cook's agents. It<br>was opened at the end of 1877, and, though it has<br>been constantly enlarged, it is always full during<br>the season, and rooms must therefore be engaged<br>in advance. There is accommodation for about<br>a hundred visitors, and at the <span style="color: #0000FF;">Kama </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">]</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">; </span>Hotel for<br>about half that number. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Until </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">1888 </span>most of the<br>Luxor Hotel rooms were built in a single line from<br>north to south, so as to receive full benefit of<br>morning and afternoon sun, and the rooms were<br>on two floors, the ground floor being raised four<br>steps above the ground. The walls are purposely<br>built of rough bricks of great thickness, so that<br>they can be kept cool on hot days, and will retain<br>their heat during winter nights. But I found that<br>invalids had to go into the open air to get from<br>their bedroom or sitting-room to the table <span style="color: #0000FF;">(</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">Finite</span>,<br>and the ever-willing proprietor only required to<br>have this disadvantage pointed out to him, to construct a large <span style="color: #0000FF;">dining-room</span>, two drawing-rooms, and<br>over these bedrooms with a central passage, which<br>allow delicate <span style="color: #ff0000;">Visitors </span>to ascend without meeting<br>the night air. Healthy visitors find no inconvenience from occupying the older rooms. Electric<br>bells have been set up, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">earth-closets </span>with <span style="color: #0000FF;">good<br><br><br><br><br><br></span>
