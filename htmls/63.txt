<span>Cairo. 47<br/><br/>Dengue fever was present in 1880 and 1887, but<br/>only from August to November: it is a painful<br/>malady, without danger to life. Typhus and<br/>relapsing fevers occur in the spring among overcrowded natives, but no case has been known<br/>among Europeans. The plague left Egypt, we<br/>hope for ever, in <span style="color: #ff0000;">1814</span>. <span style="color: #0000FF;">Small-pox</span>, as in other<br/>parts of the world, is liable to occur among<br/>those insufficiently protected by vaccination, but<br/>I remember only one case of a visitor and one<br/>of a resident. The deaths from <span style="color: #0000FF;">small-pox </span>in Cairo<br/>for <span style="color: #0000FF;">1886-7-8</span>, have averaged forty. Measles occasionally occurs as an epidemic among the natives,<br/>and causes many deaths; but I know of no visitors<br/>who have caught the disease, and only a dozen<br/>residents. <span style="color: #ff0000;">Rotheln </span>I have not yet heard of in<br/>Egypt. Scarlatina is so rare that it is only heard<br/>of at very rare intervals among the British troops.<br/>Diphtheria is not uncommon among native children,<br/>and every now and then attacks Europeans who<br/>live in insanitary houses. Whooping-cough is<br/>almost unknown, mumps very rare, and the ordinary influenza catarrh of England is uncommon.<br/>Congestion of the liver is more likely to attack<br/>alcoholic residents than visitors, and both classes<br/>are liable to pleurisy or pneumonia, if they persist<br/>in imprudent exposure at night. Phthisis does not<br/>occur among white residents, though, on the <span style="color: #0000FF;">other<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
