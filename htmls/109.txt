When swallowed, its action<br/>has hardly yet been determined, but it is apparently<br/>quite harmless. The great value of Helouan is, of<br/>course, in relation to the treatment of rheumatic<br/>diseases, and such a sanatorium during the winter<br/>months is a boon to every prescribing physician<br/>in inclement England. It is quite open to those<br/>who desire to take their fill of sulphur baths to<br/>spend the winter in Cairo and at Luxor, and take<br/>a course of baths at Helouan at any time between<br/>November and April, and then to proceed to <span style="color: #ff0000;">Aixles-Bains</span>, where the best time for a course is from<br/>May 10 to June 10, as advised by Sir A.
