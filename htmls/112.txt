<span>96 Egypt as a Winter Resort.<br/><br/>ataxy, but he found no benefit from them, and<br/>believed that the hot water was distinctly injurious<br/>to him.<br/><br/><span style="color: #0000FF;">Excursions-On </span>all sides there is the desert for<br/>walking or donkey-riding, and there are two roads<br/>for carriage-exercise. Near the hills flint implements can be found.

From them came the stone<br/>blocks and easing of the Ghizeh Pyramids, and as<br/>the quarries are still used to supply flagstones, we<br/>can compare the rough work of the present masons<br/>with the dexterous neatness of past ages. No<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">eartouel1es </span>have been discovered in the quarries<br/>older than the Twelfth Dynasty, and perhaps the<br/><span style="color: #ff0000;">commonest </span>seen to-day is that of Hakor of the<br/>Twenty-ninth.<br/><br/>An intelligent donkey-boy will help us to explore<br/>one of the many waterless valleys of the neighbourhood, <span style="color: #0000FF;">where </span>the dry water-courses still have <span style="color: #0000FF;">green<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
