<span>Cairo. 63<br/><br/>picturesque garden of twenty and a half acres by<br/>the landscape gardener to whom Paris owes the<br/>Bois de Boulogne. The gardens are <span style="color: #ff0000;">skilfully </span>laid<br/>out, and, being close to the hotels, are a useful<br/>resort by day for those who cannot take active<br/>exercise; but after sunset they are liable to be<br/>damp, in consequence of the perpetual watering of<br/>the ground and the presence of a small lake.<br/>Grass grows with <span style="color: #0000FF;">difficulty </span>in Cairo, and the<br/>Lippia <span style="color: #ff0000;">noditlorro </span>is made to take its place. There<br/>is a good restaurant, which is in great request<br/>during the summer, when military bands play in<br/>the gardens after dinner. There are very few<br/>trees or shrubs with which we are familiar in<br/>English gardens, but ivy may be seen with the<br/>cactus clinging to stately palms. Australia has<br/>furnished the she-oak and the <span style="color: #0000FF;">beef-wood </span>tree;<br/>there are sparmannia from the Cape of Good<br/>Hope; and from South America, clumps of <span style="color: #0000FF;">Cocos<br/></span>trees, silk cotton trees, and <span style="color: #0000FF;">habrothamnus</span>. Among<br/>the most noticeable trees are the blue flowering<br/>Jacaranda mimosifolia, the Erythrina <span style="color: #ff0000;">cristogalli</span>,<br/>and the pepper-tree from Brazil; the lovely <span style="color: #0000FF;">orangered </span><span style="color: #0000FF;">flowering</span><span style="color: #0000FF;">, </span>flamboyant (<span style="color: #ff0000;">Poieteiana </span><span style="color: #ff0000;">veyia</span>) from<br/>Madagascar, which is now planted in some of the<br/>Cairo streets; the mossy-cupped oak from Constantinople; the Malabar nut, <span style="color: #ff0000;">frangipanni</span>, red<br/>bean tree, and pudding-pipe tree from India; <span style="color: #0000FF;">the<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></span>
